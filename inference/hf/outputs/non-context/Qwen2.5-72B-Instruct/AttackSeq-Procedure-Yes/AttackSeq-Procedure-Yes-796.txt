### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Higaisa APT group might use.
   - The TTPs include:
     - Distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
     - Executing a JavaScript file.
     - Creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe'.
     - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
     - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Distributing Malicious LNK Files via Spear-Phishing:**
     - This is a common initial access technique used by many APT groups to gain a foothold in a target network. LNK files (shortcuts) can be crafted to execute malicious code when opened.
   - **Executing a JavaScript File:**
     - JavaScript is often used in malware to perform various actions, such as downloading additional payloads, executing commands, and evading detection.
   - **Creating and Executing 'd3reEW.exe':**
     - This could be a custom or known malicious executable that the APT group uses to further compromise the system.
   - **Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the Startup Directory:**
     - Copying a file to the startup directory ensures that it runs every time the system starts, which is a persistence technique.
   - **Sending a POST Request to a Hardcoded URL:**
     - This is a common exfiltration technique where the malware sends data back to the attacker's server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the behavior of many APT groups, including the use of spear-phishing to deliver initial payloads, executing scripts to perform further actions, creating and executing malicious executables, establishing persistence, and exfiltrating data.
   - The specific filenames and actions (e.g., 'd3reEW.exe', 'svchhast.exe', and the POST request) are plausible and align with known APT group behaviors.
