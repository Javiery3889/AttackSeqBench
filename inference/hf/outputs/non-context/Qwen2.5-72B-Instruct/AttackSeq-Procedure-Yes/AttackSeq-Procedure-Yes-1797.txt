### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access to the PCA website.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers used the dropper executable `Rdws.exe` for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 is a known method for gaining initial access to a system. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
   - **Dropper Executable (Rdws.exe):**
     - A dropper executable is typically used to download and install additional malware on the compromised system. It is a common technique in multi-stage attacks.
   - **DLL Sideloading:**
     - DLL sideloading involves replacing a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, which is then loaded by a legitimate program. This technique is often used to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
       1. Exploit the vulnerability to gain initial access.
       2. Use a dropper executable to deploy additional malware.
       3. Use DLL sideloading to evade defenses by loading a malicious DLL with a legitimate program.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the techniques described, it is indeed likely that the attackers used the dropper executable `Rdws.exe` for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
