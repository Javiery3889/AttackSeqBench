### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if it is likely that these cybercriminals would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management Systems (BMS) or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Shodan and Censys:**
     - Shodan and Censys are powerful tools used for discovering internet-connected devices and services. They are often used by security researchers and cybercriminals to identify vulnerable systems.
   - **Building Management Systems (BMS):**
     - BMS are often used to control and monitor building infrastructure, such as HVAC, lighting, and security systems. These systems can be outdated and vulnerable to attacks.
   - **MQTT Protocol:**
     - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol commonly used in IoT devices, including medical devices. Devices using MQTT can be vulnerable if not properly secured.
   - **Medical Networks' Perimeters:**
     - The perimeter of a medical network includes all the devices and systems that are exposed to the internet. These are often the first points of entry for cybercriminals.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Using Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources is a common initial step in a cyber attack. These tools can help identify a wide range of devices and systems, including BMS and medical devices.
   - **Targeting Specific Devices:**
     - Once the initial discovery is complete, it is logical for cybercriminals to focus on specific types of devices that are known to be vulnerable. Outdated BMS and medical devices supporting MQTT are prime targets because they often have known vulnerabilities and are critical to the operation of medical facilities.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given the nature of Shodan and Censys, and the known vulnerabilities of BMS and MQTT-supported medical devices, it is highly plausible that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover these specific types of devices.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
