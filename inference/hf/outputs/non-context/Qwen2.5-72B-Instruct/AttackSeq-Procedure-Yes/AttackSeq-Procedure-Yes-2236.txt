### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Rocket Kitten, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence starts with the use of a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten will establish communication with a **Command and Control (C&C) server** to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (Keylogger):** The use of a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts is a common technique under the **Credential Access** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This allows the attacker to obtain credentials that can be used to further compromise the victim's systems.
   - **Command and Control (C&C) Communication:** After gaining initial access and credentials, it is common for threat actors to establish communication with a C&C server. This communication is used to:
     - Download additional malware.
     - Receive commands from the attacker.
     - Exfiltrate data.
     - Monitor the victim's communications.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Step 1:** The attacker uses a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts (Credential Access).
     - **Step 2:** With the obtained credentials, the attacker can then establish a C&C communication to further their objectives.
   - **Common TTPs:**
     - Establishing C&C communication is a standard next step after gaining initial access and credentials. It allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system and perform additional actions such as downloading malware or monitoring communications.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and common TTPs, it is highly likely that Rocket Kitten will establish communication with a C&C server after using a keylogger to gain access to additional accounts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
