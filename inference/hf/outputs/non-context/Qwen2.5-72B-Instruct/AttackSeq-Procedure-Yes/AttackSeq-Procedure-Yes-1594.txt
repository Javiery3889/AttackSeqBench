### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the T9000 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications.
     - Stealing sensitive data from removable drives.
     - Collecting the stolen data.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will compress and encrypt this data for exfiltration over a C2 channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Compressing and encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice in malware operations. This is done to:
       - Reduce the size of the data, making it easier and faster to transfer.
       - Obfuscate the data to avoid detection by network security tools.
       - Ensure that the data remains confidential and cannot be easily intercepted or read by unauthorized parties.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not compress and encrypt the data before exfiltration.
     - This is less likely because:
       - Uncompressed and unencrypted data is more likely to be detected by network security tools.
       - Larger data transfers can be more easily noticed and flagged as suspicious.
       - The data could be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties, compromising the security of the stolen information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in malware operations and the benefits of compressing and encrypting data, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will indeed compress and encrypt the data before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
