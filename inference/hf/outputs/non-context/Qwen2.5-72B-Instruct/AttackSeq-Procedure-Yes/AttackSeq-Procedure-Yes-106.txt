### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Waterbear backdoor.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **API Hooking**: Specifically, hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable`.
     - **Defense Evasion**: Using API hooking to mask processes and TCP endpoints.
     - **C&C Communication**: Establishing communication with a C&C server using an XOR-encrypted address.
     - **Loading Executables**: Loading incoming executables after establishing communication with the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking**: Hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. `ZwOpenProcess` is often hooked to hide processes, and `GetExtendedTcpTable` is hooked to hide network connections.
   - **Defense Evasion**: By hooking these APIs, the malware can effectively mask its presence from security tools and network monitoring.
   - **C&C Communication**: Establishing communication with a C&C server using an XOR-encrypted address is a typical method for maintaining stealth and avoiding detection. XOR encryption is a simple yet effective way to obfuscate the C&C server's address.
   - **Loading Executables**: After establishing communication with the C&C server, it is common for malware to download and execute additional payloads or commands. This is a standard part of the attack lifecycle, where the initial malware acts as a loader for more sophisticated or targeted attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the Waterbear backdoor will load incoming executables after establishing communication with the C&C server. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware that uses API hooking for defense evasion and maintains communication with a C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
