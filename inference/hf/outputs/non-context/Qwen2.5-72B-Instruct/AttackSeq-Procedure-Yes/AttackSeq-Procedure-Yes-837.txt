### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the WinDealer malware.
   - The actions include collecting and processing data from various sources (USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin contents, and SNS application folders).
   - The processed data is stored in the %TEMP% directory as ".a" files.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 before exfiltrating the data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using either UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 before exfiltrating the data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate with C2 servers using these specific ports before exfiltrating the data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection and Processing:**
     - The malware collects and processes data from various sources and stores it in the %TEMP% directory. This is a common behavior for data exfiltration malware.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - Before exfiltrating data, malware often communicates with C2 servers to receive commands, send status updates, or establish a secure connection for data transfer.
   - **Specific Ports:**
     - The question mentions specific ports (UDP 6999 and TCP 55556). These ports are not standard ports for common protocols, which makes them more likely to be used by malware to avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - After processing the data, it is logical for the malware to communicate with the C2 server to exfiltrate the data. This communication is often done over specific ports to ensure the data is transmitted securely and efficiently.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware and the specific mention of ports that are not standard, it is plausible that the malware will communicate with C2 servers using these ports before exfiltrating the data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
