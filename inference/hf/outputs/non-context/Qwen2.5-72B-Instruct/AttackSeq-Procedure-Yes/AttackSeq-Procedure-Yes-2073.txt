### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary (Whitefly) has already mapped the network and infected additional computers during the discovery phase.
   - The adversary used publicly available tools and exploited vulnerabilities to achieve this.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Whitefly will compromise additional machines using stolen credentials before targeting desired data to expand their control within the organization.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Whitefly will use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines before targeting desired data.
     - This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. After gaining initial access and performing discovery, adversaries often use stolen credentials to move laterally within the network. This allows them to gain access to more systems and expand their control.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Whitefly will not use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines before targeting desired data.
     - This is less likely because using stolen credentials is a highly effective method for lateral movement and expanding control within a network.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the attack sequence described, it is highly plausible that Whitefly will use stolen credentials to compromise additional machines. This aligns with common TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where adversaries often use credential access and lateral movement techniques to expand their control within the network before targeting specific data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
