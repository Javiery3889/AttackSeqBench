### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Loading encrypted executables into legitimate system processes through process hollowing.
     - Ensuring persistence by using `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing:**
     - Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is started in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then the process is resumed. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Tasks:**
     - Creating scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe` is a common method for ensuring that malware persists across system reboots and remains active on the system. This technique is often used to ensure that the malware can re-infect the system or perform updates.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that Dexphot will indeed use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection after using process hollowing.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This answer suggests that Dexphot will not use `schtasks.exe` to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Dexphot is known for its sophisticated persistence mechanisms. One of the techniques it uses is creating scheduled tasks to ensure that it can re-infect the system or perform updates.
   - Given that Dexphot has already used process hollowing to load its malicious code into legitimate processes, it is highly likely that it would also use a common persistence technique like scheduled tasks to maintain its presence on the system.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
