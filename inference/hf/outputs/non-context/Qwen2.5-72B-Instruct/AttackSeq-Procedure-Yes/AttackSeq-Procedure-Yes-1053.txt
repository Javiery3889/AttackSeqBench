### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes deploying malware components such as small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Maintaining persistence is a common tactic used by APT groups to ensure they can maintain access to compromised systems over an extended period.
     - Autorun registry settings are a well-known method for achieving persistence. By adding entries to the autorun registry, the malware can automatically execute every time the system starts, ensuring that the attackers can maintain control.
     - Given that Darkhotel APT is known for its sophisticated and persistent operations, it is highly likely that they would use such methods to maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that Darkhotel APT would not use autorun registry settings or other malware to maintain persistence.
     - This is less likely given the nature of APT groups, which typically aim to maintain long-term access to compromised systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the Darkhotel APT group is that they would indeed use autorun registry settings and malware to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
