### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving AURORA PANDA, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organizationâ€™s website.
     - Exploitation using CVE-2014-0322.
     - Infection with ZxShell malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a C2 infrastructure at `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - AURORA PANDA is known to use strategic web compromises (SWC) to gain initial access.
     - CVE-2014-0322 is a known vulnerability that AURORA PANDA has used in the past.
     - ZxShell is a malware that AURORA PANDA has used for initial infection.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Sakula is a different malware family, not typically associated with AURORA PANDA.
     - AURORA PANDA is known to use specific C2 infrastructure and malware, but Sakula is not one of them.
     - The C2 domain `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` is not a known C2 domain for AURORA PANDA.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - AURORA PANDA's typical TTPs include:
     - Using SWC for initial access.
     - Exploiting known vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-0322.
     - Deploying ZxShell for initial infection.
   - However, Sakula is not a known malware used by AURORA PANDA.
   - The C2 domain `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` is not a known C2 domain for AURORA PANDA.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that AURORA PANDA would use Sakula malware to communicate with a C2 infrastructure at `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
