### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the OceanLotus backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent.
     - Copying itself to a specific location based on the user's UID.
     - Surveying the victim's computer.
     - Sending encrypted details about system information to a command and control (C2) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after achieving persistence and copying itself, the OceanLotus backdoor will indeed survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server.
     - This aligns with common post-compromise activities of advanced malware, where the malware often gathers system information to understand the environment and report back to the attackers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the OceanLotus backdoor will not survey the victim's computer or send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server.
     - This is less likely because gathering and exfiltrating system information is a crucial step for attackers to understand the compromised environment and plan further actions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of advanced malware and the OceanLotus backdoor, it is highly likely that the backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server after achieving persistence and copying itself.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
