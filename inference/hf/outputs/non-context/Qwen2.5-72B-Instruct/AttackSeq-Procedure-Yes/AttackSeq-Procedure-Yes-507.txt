### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the SombRAT backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Process Discovery** (Discovery phase)
     - **System Information Discovery** (Discovery phase)
     - **Communication with C2 servers** using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - **Process Discovery** and **System Information Discovery** are common techniques used by malware to gather information about the compromised system. This information can be used to determine the best course of action for further exploitation.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - After the discovery phase, it is common for malware to establish communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
     - **Proxy Tools and Protocol Tunneling:**
       - Using proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY to implement protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a sophisticated method to obfuscate and maintain communication with C2 servers.
       - These tools can help the malware bypass network security measures and maintain a low profile.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After performing discovery, it is logical for the SombRAT backdoor to use advanced techniques like proxy tools and protocol tunneling to communicate with C2 servers. This aligns with the behavior of sophisticated malware that aims to remain undetected and maintain persistent access to the compromised system.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
