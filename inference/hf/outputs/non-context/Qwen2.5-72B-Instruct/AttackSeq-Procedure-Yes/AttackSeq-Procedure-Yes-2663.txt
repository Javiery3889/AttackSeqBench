### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Execution of 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' to establish backdoor access.
     - Installation of additional malware to access user databases.
     - Communication with a command and control (C2) server.
   - The question also mentions a specific domain ('update.alyac.org') and an IP address (116.127.121.41).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoor.Agent.Hza:**
     - This is a known backdoor malware that allows attackers to gain remote access to a compromised system.
   - **Additional Malware:**
     - The installation of additional malware to access user databases suggests that the attackers are further compromising the system to exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - Once a backdoor is established, it is common for the infected system to communicate with a C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Domain and IP Address:**
     - The domain 'update.alyac.org' resolving to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41 suggests that the C2 server is located in South Korea.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attackers have established a backdoor and installed additional malware, it is highly likely that the infected computers would communicate with a C2 server.
   - The fact that the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolves to a South Korean IP address (116.127.121.41) aligns with the scenario where the C2 server is located in South Korea.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the infected computers communicated with the C2 server while the domain resolved to the specified IP address.
