### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT (Remote Access Trojan) to target systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Campaign:** Phishing is a common initial access technique used to deliver malware to target systems. This aligns with the initial step in the question.
   - **BlackEnergy 3 RAT:** BlackEnergy 3 is a known piece of malware that has been used in various cyber attacks. It often includes capabilities for remote control and data exfiltration.
   - **Malicious VBA Script Execution:** VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripts are commonly used in Office documents to execute malicious code. This technique is often used to establish a C2 connection.
   - **C2 Connection:** Establishing a C2 connection is a critical step for adversaries to maintain control over the compromised system and perform further malicious activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Phishing campaigns are often used to deliver malware like BlackEnergy 3.
   - Once the malware is delivered, it is common for adversaries to use techniques like VBA script execution to establish a C2 connection.
   - The C2 connection allows the adversaries to control the compromised system and perform additional actions, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further malware deployment.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
