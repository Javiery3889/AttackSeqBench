### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Obtaining credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.
     - Gathering information on services using system service discovery.
     - Moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obtaining Credentials:**
     - Process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a common technique used to extract credentials from memory.
     - Using trojanized KeePass binaries is another method to steal credentials, as KeePass is a popular password manager.
   - **Gathering Information on Services:**
     - System service discovery is a reconnaissance technique where the attacker gathers information about running services on the target system. This information can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities or services that can be exploited.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a powerful tool for managing and querying system information and can be used for lateral movement.
     - Custom web shells are another method for maintaining persistence and moving laterally within a network.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - After obtaining credentials, it is logical for an attacker to gather more information about the target system to plan the next steps.
     - System service discovery helps in identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
     - Using WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement is a common and effective technique in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.
   - **FIN13's TTPs:**
     - FIN13 is known for using sophisticated techniques and maintaining a low profile. The described sequence aligns with the typical behavior of a well-organized and advanced threat actor.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
