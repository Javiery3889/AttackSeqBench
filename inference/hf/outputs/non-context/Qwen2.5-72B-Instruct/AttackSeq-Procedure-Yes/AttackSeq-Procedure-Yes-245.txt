### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involve:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of CVE-2018-0798 through a malicious RTF document.
     - **Preparation:** Creation of a document that appears to be sent by the Cabinet of Cambodia and contains a list of government officials to lure victims.
     - **Post-Exploitation:** Use of the file 'OSEA54d.tmp' to drop additional malicious files into system directories.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2018-0798 through a malicious RTF document is a known technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a system.
     - **Preparation:** Creating a document that appears to be from a trusted source (like the Cabinet of Cambodia) to lure victims is a common social engineering tactic.
     - **Post-Exploitation:** Using a temporary file (like 'OSEA54d.tmp') to drop additional malicious files is a typical method for maintaining persistence and furthering the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.
     - However, the sequence described aligns well with known attack patterns and TTPs.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Initial Access:** CVE-2018-0798 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited through a malicious RTF document. This is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **Preparation:** Social engineering is a critical component of many cyber attacks. Creating a document that appears to be from a trusted source (like the Cabinet of Cambodia) is a well-documented technique to trick victims into opening the malicious document.
   - **Post-Exploitation:** Once initial access is gained, attackers often use temporary files to drop additional malicious payloads. This helps in maintaining persistence and furthering the attack.

Given the alignment of the described TTPs with known attack patterns, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
