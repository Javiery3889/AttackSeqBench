### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, or Sofacy).
   - The initial step involves delivering a Flash exploit "flash_video_x86.swf" via a spear-phishing email.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will use the resulting malware to:
     - Utilize an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit.
     - Enable persistence on the victim's machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Infection Vector:**
     - The use of a Flash exploit via a spear-phishing email is a common initial infection vector for many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including Sednit.
   - **Post-Exploitation Activities:**
     - Once the initial exploit is successful, it is common for APT groups to escalate privileges to gain higher access on the victim's machine.
     - Privilege escalation is often achieved by exploiting known vulnerabilities, including unpatched ones.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Enabling persistence is a critical step for APT groups to maintain long-term access to the victim's machine.
     - Techniques for persistence include creating new accounts, modifying registry keys, or using scheduled tasks.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the group will likely use the resulting malware to escalate privileges and enable persistence.
     - Given the typical behavior of APT groups like Sednit, this is a highly plausible sequence of actions.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the group will not use the resulting malware to escalate privileges and enable persistence.
     - This is less likely, as these steps are crucial for maintaining control and achieving the group's objectives.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
