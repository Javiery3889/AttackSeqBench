### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware named Machete.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Stealing clipboard contents
     - Capturing screenshots
     - Logging keystrokes
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers before exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Clipboard Contents, Capturing Screenshots, and Logging Keystrokes:**
     - These are common data collection techniques used by malware to gather sensitive information from the victim's system.
   - **Using FTP and HTTP Ports for Communication:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) are well-known protocols that are often allowed through firewalls and network security measures.
     - Malware often uses these protocols to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltrating Encrypted Data:**
     - Encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice to protect the data from being intercepted and analyzed during transmission.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. After collecting data, it is common for malware to use standard protocols like FTP and HTTP to communicate with C2 servers and exfiltrate the data, often in an encrypted form to avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of FTP and HTTP for C2 communication and the typical practice of encrypting exfiltrated data, the sequence described in the question is indeed likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
