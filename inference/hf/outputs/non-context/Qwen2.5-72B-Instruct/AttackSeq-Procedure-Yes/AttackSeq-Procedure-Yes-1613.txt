### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group:
     1. Using backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers.
     2. Executing remote commands.
     3. Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
     4. Disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoor Malware and C2 Communication:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Backdoor malware allows attackers to maintain persistent access to the target network and communicate with C2 servers to receive further instructions.
   - **Executing Remote Commands:**
     - Once the backdoor is established, attackers can execute remote commands to perform various actions, such as reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
   - **Deploying Hermes Ransomware:**
     - Hermes ransomware is known for its ability to encrypt files and delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files. This makes it difficult for the victim to recover their data without paying the ransom.
   - **Disrupting Operations:**
     - Deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files can significantly disrupt operations by making it difficult to restore data. This aligns with the goal of a heist, where the attackers want to maximize the impact and pressure the victim to pay the ransom.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described, it is highly plausible that the Lazarus group would deploy Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files to disrupt the bank's operations during the heist.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
