### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the actions of the lightSpy malware, which includes data collection from various sources such as hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data (WeChat, QQ, and Telegram).
   - It then asks whether it is likely that lightSpy leverages hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Collection:** The malware is described as performing data collection from multiple sources, which is a common tactic in cyber attacks to gather sensitive information.
   - **C&C Server Usage:** Hardcoded C&C server locations are a common method for malware to communicate with its operators. This allows the malware to receive commands, update modules, and exfiltrate data.
   - **Main Control Module (light):** The question mentions a main control module named "light," which suggests that this module is responsible for managing the communication with the C&C server and other operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of Hardcoded C&C Servers:**
     - Hardcoding C&C server locations is a common technique used by malware developers to ensure that the malware can reliably communicate with the C&C server. This is especially true for malware that needs to perform regular updates and data exfiltration.
     - The use of a main control module (light) further supports the idea that the malware has a centralized mechanism for managing these operations, which is consistent with the use of hardcoded C&C servers.
   - **Consistency with Known Malware Behavior:**
     - Many known malware families, including those that target specific data types (like hardware information, contacts, and messaging app data), often use hardcoded C&C servers to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the described behavior of lightSpy and the common practices in malware development, it is highly likely that lightSpy leverages hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
