### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that further analysis of the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` will reveal additional associated malware samples that communicate with multiple C2 domains.
   - The threat actor mentioned is AridViper.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Threat actors, especially sophisticated ones like AridViper, often use multiple C2 domains to maintain resilience and operational flexibility.
     - If one C2 domain is identified, it is common for further analysis to uncover additional domains and associated malware samples.
     - This is a standard practice in cyber threat intelligence and malware analysis to map out the full scope of the threat actor's infrastructure.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the identified C2 domain is an isolated incident and that no further associated malware samples or C2 domains will be found.
     - This is less likely for a well-known and sophisticated threat actor like AridViper, who typically uses a network of C2 domains to support their operations.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the nature of sophisticated threat actors like AridViper, it is highly likely that further analysis will reveal additional associated malware samples and C2 domains.
   - The use of multiple C2 domains is a common tactic to ensure the persistence and resilience of their operations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
