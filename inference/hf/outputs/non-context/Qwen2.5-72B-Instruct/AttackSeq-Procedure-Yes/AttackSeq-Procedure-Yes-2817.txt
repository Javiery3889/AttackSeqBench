### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the authors of Hacking Team's spyware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access.
     - Using VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection.
     - Establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware did use VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection.
     - VMProtect is a well-known tool used to obfuscate and protect executable files, making it harder for security software to detect and analyze the malware.
     - Given the sophisticated nature of Hacking Team's operations, it is plausible that they would use such tools to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware did not use VMProtect for obfuscation.
     - This would imply that they either used other methods for obfuscation or did not use any obfuscation at all, which is less likely given the advanced nature of their operations.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Hacking Team is known for its sophisticated and advanced malware development.
   - Using tools like VMProtect to obfuscate their malware is a common practice in the cyber threat landscape to evade detection by security software.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical TTPs of advanced threat actors, including the use of obfuscation tools.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
