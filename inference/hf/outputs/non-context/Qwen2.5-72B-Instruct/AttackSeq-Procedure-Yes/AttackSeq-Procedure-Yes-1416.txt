### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving ChromeLoader and CloudMensis.
   - ChromeLoader is known for overriding macOS security technology using an animated image.
   - The question then asks if CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) restrictions before using public cloud storage services for C2 (Command and Control) communication.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CloudMensis is likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions before using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.
     - CVE-2020-9934 is a vulnerability in the iOS and macOS TCC database that can be exploited to bypass privacy protections and gain access to sensitive data.
     - CloudMensis is known for using various techniques to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. Exploiting CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions would align with its goals of gaining deeper access to the system and maintaining control.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CloudMensis is not likely to exploit CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions before using public cloud storage services for C2 communication.
     - If CloudMensis does not exploit CVE-2020-9934, it would need to use other methods to bypass TCC restrictions, which might be less effective or more detectable.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that CloudMensis is known for sophisticated and targeted attacks, it is plausible that it would use a known vulnerability like CVE-2020-9934 to bypass TCC restrictions. This would allow it to gain deeper access to the system and maintain control, which is consistent with its known TTPs.
   - Exploiting CVE-2020-9934 would provide a significant advantage in bypassing security measures, making it a likely step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
