### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Seaduke malware.
   - Key points:
     - Seaduke retrieves detailed bot/system information.
     - Seaduke securely deletes itself using a 'seppuku' function.
     - The question asks if it is likely that Seaduke will communicate with its C&C server and remain under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption after these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Seaduke Malware:**
     - Seaduke is a sophisticated malware known for its ability to gather detailed information from infected systems.
     - It has a 'seppuku' function, which is a self-destruction mechanism designed to remove traces of the malware from the system.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Retrieving Detailed Bot/System Information:**
       - This is a common initial action for malware to gather information about the infected system.
     - **Securely Deleting Itself (Seppuku):**
       - The 'seppuku' function is designed to delete the malware from the system, which is typically done to avoid detection and forensic analysis.
     - **Communication with C&C Server:**
       - Malware often communicates with a C&C server to send stolen data and receive further instructions.
       - However, if the malware has already deleted itself, it would no longer be present on the system to communicate with the C&C server.
     - **Remaining Under Attackers' Control:**
       - For the malware to remain under the attackers' control, it must be present on the system and able to communicate with the C&C server.
       - If the malware has deleted itself, it cannot remain under the attackers' control.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the 'seppuku' function securely deletes the malware from the system, it is unlikely that Seaduke will continue to communicate with its C&C server or remain under the attackers' control.

**Final Answer: B: No**
