### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor 'Energetic Bear' (also known as Dragonfly or Crouching Yeti).
   - The sequence involves:
     - Compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack.
     - Using a watering hole technique to target Turkish critical infrastructure for initial access.
     - Harvesting Microsoft SMB credentials through a redirected image URL to a file protocol as part of their credential access strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of a supply chain attack and a watering hole technique to gain initial access is consistent with the known TTPs of 'Energetic Bear'. They have been known to compromise legitimate websites and use them to deliver malware to their targets.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that 'Energetic Bear' would harvest Microsoft SMB credentials through a redirected image URL to a file protocol.
     - While 'Energetic Bear' is known for sophisticated credential access techniques, the specific method of harvesting credentials through a redirected image URL to a file protocol is not a common or well-documented TTP for this group.
     - Typically, 'Energetic Bear' uses more direct methods such as phishing, keyloggers, and credential dumping tools to harvest credentials.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of 'Energetic Bear', the method of harvesting credentials through a redirected image URL to a file protocol is not a typical or well-documented technique for this group. Therefore, it is less likely that they would use this method.

**Final Answer: B: No**
