### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Elirks malware retrieves its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites.
   - The attackers are said to create accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that Elirks malware uses microblog services or social networking sites to retrieve C2 server addresses.
     - This method is a known technique in the realm of malware, often referred to as "domain generation algorithms" (DGAs) or "dynamic C2 communication." Malware can use these platforms to receive updates or instructions, including C2 server addresses, which can be encoded in posts or comments.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that Elirks malware uses microblog services or social networking sites to retrieve C2 server addresses.
     - This would imply that Elirks uses a different method, such as hard-coded C2 server addresses or other communication channels.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Plausibility of Answer Choice A:**
     - Using social media or microblog services to post encoded C2 server addresses is a common technique to evade detection and maintain a dynamic and resilient C2 infrastructure.
     - This method allows attackers to change C2 server addresses frequently, making it harder for defenders to block or take down the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Plausibility of Answer Choice B:**
     - While it is possible that Elirks uses a different method, the described technique is well-documented and widely used in various malware families.
     - Without specific evidence to the contrary, it is more plausible to assume that Elirks could use this method.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
