### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NewsBeef group.
   - The sequence starts with initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
   - It then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download poisoned installers, which will execute PowerSploit scripts, and these scripts will subsequently download and run the Pupy backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spearphishing and watering hole attacks are common initial access techniques.
     - Malicious macro-enabled Office documents are often used in these attacks to execute initial payloads.
   - **PowerShell Scripts:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers for various purposes, including downloading and executing additional payloads.
   - **Poisoned Installers:**
     - Downloading poisoned installers is a plausible next step after gaining initial access. These installers can be used to maintain persistence or to download additional malware.
   - **PowerSploit:**
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for post-exploitation activities, such as privilege escalation, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.
   - **Pupy Backdoor:**
     - Pupy is a remote administration tool (RAT) that can be used for maintaining access and controlling the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common progression in cyber attacks:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious Office documents.
     2. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:** Use PowerShell to download and execute additional payloads.
     3. **Download Poisoned Installers:** Use the PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers.
     4. **Execute PowerSploit Scripts:** Use PowerSploit scripts to perform post-exploitation activities.
     5. **Download and Run Pupy Backdoor:** Use PowerSploit to download and run the Pupy backdoor for maintaining access.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
