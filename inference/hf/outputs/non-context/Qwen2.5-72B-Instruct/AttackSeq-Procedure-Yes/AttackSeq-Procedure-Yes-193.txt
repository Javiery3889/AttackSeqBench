### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence in question involves:
     - **Resource Development**: Acquiring domains and servers from providers like Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY.
     - **Initial Access**: Exploiting public-facing applications such as Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development**:
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Threat actors often need to set up infrastructure to launch their attacks, which can include acquiring domains and servers.
     - Providers like Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY are plausible sources for such infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access**:
     - Exploiting public-facing applications is a well-documented technique used by various threat actors, including FamousSparrow.
     - Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera are known to have vulnerabilities that can be exploited for initial access.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known TTPs of threat actors:
     - **Resource Development** is typically the first step, where the attacker sets up the necessary infrastructure.
     - **Initial Access** follows, where the attacker uses the infrastructure to gain entry into the target network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the known TTPs of threat actors like FamousSparrow, it is indeed likely that they would follow this sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
