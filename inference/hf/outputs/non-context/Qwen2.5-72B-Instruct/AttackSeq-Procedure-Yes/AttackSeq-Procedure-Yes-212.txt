### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a custom screenshot tool, a custom backdoor (Backdoor.Graphon), and Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - The question asks whether these tools are likely to communicate with C&C (Command and Control) servers hosted on Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront using an encrypted channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Custom Screenshot Tool:**
     - This tool captures and archives screenshots for collection. This is a common technique used by malware to exfiltrate data.
   - **Backdoor.Graphon:**
     - This is a custom backdoor, which is a type of malware designed to provide persistent access to a compromised system.
   - **Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - Cobalt Strike is a popular penetration testing tool that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. The Beacon is the payload that communicates with the C&C server.
   - **C&C Servers on Microsoft Infrastructure and CloudFront:**
     - Adversaries often use legitimate cloud services to host their C&C servers to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Encrypted Channel:**
     - Modern malware and penetration testing tools like Cobalt Strike typically use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure the integrity of the communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Custom Screenshot Tool:**
     - Capturing and archiving screenshots is a common exfiltration technique.
   - **Backdoor.Graphon:**
     - A custom backdoor would likely be designed to communicate with a C&C server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - Cobalt Strike Beacon is known for its ability to communicate over encrypted channels, making it a suitable choice for evading detection.
   - **C&C Servers on Microsoft Infrastructure and CloudFront:**
     - Using legitimate cloud services like Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront is a common tactic to avoid raising suspicion and to leverage the reliability and scalability of these services.
   - **Encrypted Channel:**
     - Given the sophistication of tools like Cobalt Strike, it is highly likely that the communication with the C&C servers would be encrypted.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
