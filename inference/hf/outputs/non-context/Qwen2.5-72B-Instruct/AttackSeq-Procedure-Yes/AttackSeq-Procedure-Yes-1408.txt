### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where cybercriminals use phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and lock out the original account owners.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts.
     - This is a plausible scenario because:
       - Cybercriminals often use ransom as a way to monetize their attacks quickly.
       - Accounts with significant followings are valuable, and the owners might be willing to pay to regain access.
       - Demanding ransom can be a straightforward and effective way to extort money from the victims.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the cybercriminals will not demand ransom payments.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - While it is possible that the cybercriminals might directly use the accounts for further scams without demanding ransom, the value of the accounts makes ransom a likely initial step.
       - The immediate financial gain from ransom can be more attractive than the potential long-term gains from further scams.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
