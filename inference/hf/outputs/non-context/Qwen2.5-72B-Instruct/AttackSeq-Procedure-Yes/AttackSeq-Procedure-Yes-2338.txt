### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL every two hours.
   - It then asks if it is likely that RevengeRAT will establish communication with command and control (C2) servers and send victim machine information to specific domains while the attacker's infrastructure is located in Canada and Brazil.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs Mentioned:**
     - **Persistence:** The use of a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL every two hours is a common technique for maintaining persistence on a victim's machine.
     - **Initial Communication:** `mshta.exe` is often used to download and execute malicious scripts or payloads from a remote server.
     - **C2 Communication:** Once the initial payload is executed, it is common for malware like RevengeRAT to establish communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.
     - **C2 Domains:** The domains mentioned (`office365update[.]duckdns.org` and `systen32.ddns[.]net`) are typical for C2 infrastructure, often using dynamic DNS services to avoid detection.
     - **Attacker Infrastructure:** The attacker's infrastructure being located in Canada and Brazil is plausible, as attackers often use geographically diverse infrastructure to obfuscate their true location and evade law enforcement.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Initial Execution:**
     - The use of a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a malicious URL is a well-documented technique for maintaining persistence and ensuring that the malware is executed regularly.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once the malicious URL is executed, it is highly likely that the malware will establish communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.
   - **C2 Domains:**
     - The domains mentioned are consistent with the types of domains used by C2 infrastructure, especially those using dynamic DNS services.
   - **Attacker Infrastructure:**
     - The attacker's infrastructure being located in multiple countries (Canada and Brazil) is a common tactic to make it harder to trace and shut down the C2 servers.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs and the plausibility of the described attack, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
