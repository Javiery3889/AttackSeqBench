### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SLUB malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Collecting system information and capturing screenshots.
     - **Interaction with a Mattermost server:** The malware interacts with a Mattermost server during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate the collected system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will use the same Mattermost server for exfiltration.
     - It is plausible because:
       - The Mattermost server is already a known communication channel for the malware.
       - Using the same server for both discovery and exfiltration can simplify the malware's operations and reduce the risk of detection by using fewer communication points.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not use the same Mattermost server for exfiltration.
     - It is less plausible because:
       - It would require the malware to establish a new communication channel, which could increase the complexity and risk of detection.
       - There is no indication in the question that the malware has any reason to avoid using the same server for exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will exfiltrate the collected system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
