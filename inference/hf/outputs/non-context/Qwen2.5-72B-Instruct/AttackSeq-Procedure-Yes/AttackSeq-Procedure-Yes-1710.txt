### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Turla group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using an encrypted file system for defense evasion.
     - Storing stolen data and tools.
     - The question asks if it is likely that Turla will include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Encrypted File System for Defense Evasion:**
     - Turla is known for using sophisticated methods to evade detection, including the use of encrypted file systems to hide stolen data and tools.
   - **Storing Stolen Data and Tools:**
     - Once the data and tools are encrypted, they are stored securely to prevent detection and ensure they can be accessed later.
   - **Document Stealers:**
     - Document stealers are specialized tools designed to collect and exfiltrate documents from information repositories. They are commonly used in cyber espionage campaigns to gather sensitive information.
   - **Turla's Known TTPs:**
     - Turla is a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has a history of using a variety of tools and techniques to achieve its objectives, including data exfiltration and espionage.
     - Given Turla's focus on espionage and the value of documents in such operations, it is highly likely that they would use document stealers as part of their toolkit.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that Turla would include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories, as this aligns with their known TTPs and objectives.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
