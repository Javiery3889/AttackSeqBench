### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Downloading encoded blobs.
     - Decoding these blobs to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
     - The potential next step is the file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will indeed iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
     - This is a common technique used by malware to gather sensitive information. After evading defenses, the next logical step is to collect and exfiltrate valuable data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will not iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
     - This is less likely because the primary goal of many backdoors and file-stealers is to gather and exfiltrate data, and iterating through directories to collect files is a standard method to achieve this.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Initial Infection and Backdoor Deployment:** The backdoor is deployed.
     2. **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor downloads and decodes encoded blobs to PowerShell scripts to evade detection.
     3. **Data Collection:** The next logical step is to collect data, which is typically done by iterating through directories to find files with specific extensions.
   - Given the context and the common practices in malware operations, it is highly likely that the file-stealer module will perform automated collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
