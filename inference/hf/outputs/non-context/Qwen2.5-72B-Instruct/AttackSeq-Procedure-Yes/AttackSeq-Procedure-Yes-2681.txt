### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for a malware called KiraV2.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Periodic communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Use of encoded port numbers and hard-coded IP addresses.
     - The potential for performing various types of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to disrupt the availability of targeted services and infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that KiraV2 is likely to perform DDoS attacks after establishing communication with its C&C server.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Malware often communicates with a C&C server to receive commands and instructions.
       - Encoded port numbers and hard-coded IP addresses are common techniques used to obfuscate communication and avoid detection.
       - DDoS attacks are a common tactic used by malware to disrupt services and infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that KiraV2 is unlikely to perform DDoS attacks.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - The described TTPs (periodic communication, encoded port numbers, hard-coded IP addresses) are consistent with the behavior of malware that can be used for DDoS attacks.
       - DDoS attacks are a common objective for malware, especially those that communicate with C&C servers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that KiraV2 will perform DDoS attacks after establishing communication with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
