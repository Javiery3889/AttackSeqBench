### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
   - The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will query the registry and identify victim machines as part of its discovery process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547):** The malware adds Intel-related files to registry run keys to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a common technique for maintaining persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036):** The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable to avoid detection by security software. This is a common technique for evading defenses.
   - **Discovery (T1012):** Querying the registry and identifying victim machines is a common discovery technique. Malware often queries the registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations, to better understand the environment and plan its next steps.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After achieving persistence and evading defenses, it is highly likely that the malware will proceed to gather information about the victim machine. This is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and determine the next actions, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further exploitation.
   - Querying the registry is a common and effective method for gathering this information. It helps the malware identify the operating system, installed software, and other relevant details that can be used to tailor its actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
