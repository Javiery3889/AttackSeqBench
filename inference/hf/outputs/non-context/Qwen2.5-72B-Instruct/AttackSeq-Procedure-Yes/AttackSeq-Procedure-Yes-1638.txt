### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the monitoring of running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe` as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - It then asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:**
     - Monitoring running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe` is a common technique used to understand the environment and identify potential targets or tools that can be leveraged. This is part of the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Impact Tactic:**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction, manipulation, or denial of service. Modifying source code to inject a backdoor is a form of data manipulation and can be considered part of the Impact tactic.
   - **SUNSPOT and SUNBURST:**
     - SUNSPOT is a malware that was used to compromise the build process of SolarWinds' Orion software. It was responsible for injecting the SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion source code.
     - The injection of the SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion source code is a well-documented part of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, which is a significant impact on the integrity of the software.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question describes a sequence where SUNSPOT is monitoring processes (Discovery) and then asks if it is likely to modify the Orion source code (Impact), the answer aligns with the known behavior of SUNSPOT in the SolarWinds attack.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the known tactics and techniques used by SUNSPOT to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
