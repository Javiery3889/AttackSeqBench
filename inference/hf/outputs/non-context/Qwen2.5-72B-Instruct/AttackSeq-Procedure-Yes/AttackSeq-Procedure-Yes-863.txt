### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - The initial step involves using a modular malware framework during resource development, where the malware's functionality is defined by uploaded modules to targeted systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that GreyEnergy will proceed to secure access to ICS (Industrial Control System) control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Modular Malware Framework:** GreyEnergy is known for using modular malware, which allows them to dynamically load different modules to perform various tasks. This is a common tactic for advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to maintain flexibility and adapt to different environments.
   - **Resource Development:** The use of modular malware during resource development suggests that GreyEnergy is in the early stages of their attack, where they are setting up the necessary infrastructure and tools to carry out their objectives.
   - **Securing Access to ICS Control Workstations and Servers:** Once the initial foothold is established, it is common for APT groups to move laterally within the network to gain access to critical systems, such as ICS control workstations and servers.
   - **Host Information Gathering:** Reconnaissance is a crucial step in any cyber attack, especially for APT groups. Gathering information about the host systems helps the attackers understand the network topology, identify valuable targets, and plan their next moves.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the modular nature of the malware and the typical attack lifecycle of APT groups like GreyEnergy, it is highly likely that they will proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
