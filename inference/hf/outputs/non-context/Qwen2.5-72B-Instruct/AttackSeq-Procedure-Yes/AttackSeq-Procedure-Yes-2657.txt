### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Korplug variant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Data collection from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     - Communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers.
     - Use of a custom TCP-based protocol for communication.
     - Initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
     - Subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely for Korplug.
     - Korplug is known to be a sophisticated malware that often uses advanced communication methods to exfiltrate data and maintain persistence.
     - The use of a custom TCP-based protocol for communication is a common tactic for malware to avoid detection by standard network monitoring tools.
     - The initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP is a plausible method to establish a secure and stealthy connection.
     - Subsequent encrypted communication over TCP is a standard practice to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely for Korplug.
     - However, given the sophistication of Korplug and the common practices in malware communication, this choice seems less plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for Korplug is described in the question.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
