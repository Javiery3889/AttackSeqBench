### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary gains initial access to the victim's network through compromised remote services (e.g., VPN, Citrix).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will use scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory before achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains access through compromised remote services, which is a common initial access technique (T1133 - External Remote Services).
   - **Execution in Memory:** Using scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory is a plausible next step. Scheduled tasks (T1053) can be used to run scripts or commands at specific times, which can be used to maintain access and execute payloads.
   - **Persistence:** Achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers is a logical next step. Servers often have high uptimes and are critical to the network, making them valuable targets for persistence (T1098 - Account Manipulation, T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, T1546 - Event Triggered Execution).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains access through compromised remote services.
     - **Execution in Memory:** The adversary uses scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. This is a common technique to maintain access and ensure the beacon runs periodically.
     - **Persistence:** The adversary then targets systems with high uptimes like servers to achieve persistence. This ensures that the adversary can maintain long-term access to the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. It follows a logical progression of TTPs that are commonly used in cyber attacks.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
