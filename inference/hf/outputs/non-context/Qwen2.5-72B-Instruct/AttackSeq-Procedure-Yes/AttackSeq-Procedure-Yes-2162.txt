### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where APT35 gains initial access to a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
   - It then asks if it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the detection of Command and Control (C2) activity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT35 uses a spear phishing email to gain access to a corporate device.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The attackers establish a C2 channel to control the infected device.
   - **Detection and Investigation:** Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automates the investigation process to analyze the infected device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Spear Phishing):** This is a common TTP used by APT35 and is a plausible first step in the attack.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** After gaining initial access, it is typical for attackers to establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised device.
   - **Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst:** Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is an automated tool designed to detect and investigate cyber threats. It is capable of identifying and responding to C2 activity, which is a critical step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst is designed to automate the detection and investigation of cyber threats, it is highly likely that it would be triggered to analyze the infected device once C2 activity is detected.
   - The sequence of events described in the question aligns well with the capabilities and typical operations of Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
