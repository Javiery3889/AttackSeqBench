### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary has identified privileged users during the discovery phase using the PsLogList tool.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The adversary uses PsLogList to identify privileged users.
   - **Collection Phase:** The adversary collects email messages from both local and remote systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase (PsLogList):**
     - PsLogList is a tool used to list event logs, which can help in identifying user activities, including those of privileged users. This is a common technique in the discovery phase to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Collection Phase (Email Collection):**
     - Collecting email messages is a common data collection technique used by adversaries to gather sensitive information. This can be done from both local and remote systems, depending on the adversary's access and the nature of the target environment.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - After identifying privileged users, it is logical for an adversary to target their email messages, as these users often have access to sensitive information.
     - Collecting emails from both local and remote systems is a comprehensive approach to ensure the adversary gathers as much information as possible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression from the discovery phase to the collection phase, and the common practice of collecting email messages from privileged users, the most plausible answer is that the adversary would indeed collect email messages from both local and remote systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
