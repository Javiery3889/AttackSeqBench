### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by The Outlaw group.
   - The sequence involves using Shellbot to maintain persistent communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers via IRC.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will gather information about the infected host (such as processor details and installed monitoring tools) before establishing and maintaining the IRC channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **Initial Infection and C&C Communication:**
       - Shellbot is known for its ability to establish a persistent communication channel with C&C servers using IRC.
       - This is a common initial step in many malware operations to ensure the attacker can control the infected host.
     - **Information Gathering:**
       - Gathering information about the infected host (e.g., processor details, installed monitoring tools) is a common next step in many malware operations.
       - This information can be used to tailor further attacks, avoid detection, or determine the value of the compromised host.
     - **Sequence of Events:**
       - Typically, malware will establish a C&C communication channel first to ensure it can receive commands and exfiltrate data.
       - Once the C&C channel is established, the malware can then proceed to gather detailed information about the host.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in malware operations, it is more likely that the malware will establish the C&C communication channel first before gathering detailed information about the host.
   - Establishing the C&C channel is a critical first step to ensure the attacker can control the infected host and receive further commands.

### Final Answer: B: No
