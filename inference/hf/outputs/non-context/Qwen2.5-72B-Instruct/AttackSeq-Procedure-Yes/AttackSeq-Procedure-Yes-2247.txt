### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy, a known threat actor, is likely to use a specific sequence of TTPs (malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs) to deliver final payloads and establish initial access to victim systems, particularly targeting Kavach, a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app used by the Government of India.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Malicious LNK files
     - HTAs (HTML Application files)
     - Loader DLLs

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SideCopy's Known TTPs:**
     - SideCopy is a threat actor known for targeting government and military organizations, particularly in South Asia.
     - They have been observed using a variety of TTPs to establish initial access and deliver payloads, including:
       - Phishing emails with malicious attachments (e.g., LNK files, HTAs)
       - Exploiting vulnerabilities in software
       - Using loader DLLs to execute payloads
   - **Relevance to the Question:**
     - Malicious LNK files are often used to execute scripts or download additional malware when a user clicks on them.
     - HTAs can be used to run scripts and download additional payloads, often bypassing security measures.
     - Loader DLLs are used to load and execute the final payload, often in memory to avoid detection.
     - These TTPs align with the known methods used by SideCopy to establish initial access and deliver payloads.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given SideCopy's history of using phishing emails with malicious attachments and loader DLLs, it is plausible that they would use a sequence involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to target Kavach, a critical MFA app used by the Government of India.
   - The combination of these TTPs is consistent with their known attack patterns and would be effective in establishing initial access and delivering final payloads.
