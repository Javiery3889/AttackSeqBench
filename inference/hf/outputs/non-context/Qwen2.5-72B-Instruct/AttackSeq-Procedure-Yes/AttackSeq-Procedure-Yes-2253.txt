### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Credential Access:** Targeting access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT.
     - **Exfiltration:** Using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SideCopy Group:**
     - SideCopy is a known threat actor that has been active since at least 2016 and is known for targeting Indian government and military organizations.
     - They have a history of using various malware and techniques to gain and maintain access to their targets.

   - **njRAT:**
     - njRAT (also known as Bladabindi) is a remote access trojan (RAT) that has been used in various cyber campaigns.
     - It is known for its ability to steal credentials and other sensitive information from infected systems.

   - **GoLang-based File Recon Plugins:**
     - Go (Golang) is a programming language that is often used for developing efficient and cross-platform tools.
     - File recon plugins in Go can be used to search for and exfiltrate specific files, such as authentication databases.

   - **Kavach Authentication Databases:**
     - Kavach is a security solution used by the Indian government for authentication and access control.
     - Exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases would provide the attackers with sensitive information that could be used to gain further access or perform other malicious activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - It is plausible that SideCopy would target Indian government employees for credential access, given their known targeting of Indian organizations.
     - Using njRAT for this purpose is also reasonable, as njRAT is a well-known tool for stealing credentials.

   - **Exfiltration:**
     - After gaining access to the credentials, it is logical for the attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as Kavach authentication databases.
     - Using GoLang-based file recon plugins for this task is also plausible, as Go is a language that can be used to develop efficient and effective exfiltration tools.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns well with the known tactics and targets of the SideCopy group.
   - Therefore, it is likely that SideCopy would follow this sequence of actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
