### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for Raccoon stealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Execution Phase:** Collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** Making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion.
     - **Communication with C&C Servers:** Using Telegram features to communicate with these C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Raccoon stealer will indeed make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers and use Telegram features for communication.
     - This aligns with the described sequence of TTPs, where the stealer uses Telegram to bypass blocking and ensure Defense Evasion before communicating with the C&C servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Raccoon stealer will not make network requests to a Telegram channel for the described purposes.
     - This does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, as it contradicts the use of Telegram for receiving encrypted addresses and ensuring Defense Evasion.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.
   - The use of Telegram to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers and to communicate with them aligns with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
