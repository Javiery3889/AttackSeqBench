### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The use of spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the known tactics of Hidden Cobra.
   - **Bankshot Implants:** Bankshot is a known implant used by Hidden Cobra. It is designed to provide full control over victim systems, which is a common goal in post-exploitation activities.
   - **Resource Development:** The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines Resource Development as the process of establishing resources that can be used to support operations. This includes developing or obtaining infrastructure, tools, and capabilities.
   - **Wiping Files:** Wiping files is a destructive action that is more aligned with the Impact tactic rather than Resource Development. The goal of Resource Development is to set up and maintain the necessary resources for an attack, not to cause immediate damage.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Post-Exploitation:** The initial access and the use of Bankshot implants to gain full control over the victim systems are consistent with Hidden Cobra's known TTPs.
   - **Resource Development vs. Impact:** The question asks if the Bankshot implants will be used to wipe files under the tactic of Resource Development. Wiping files is more aligned with the Impact tactic, which involves actions to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data.
   - **Plausibility:** It is not plausible that the Bankshot implants would be used to wipe files under the Resource Development tactic. The primary goal of Resource Development is to set up and maintain resources, not to cause immediate damage.
