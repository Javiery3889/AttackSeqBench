### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer (hostname, OS name, system type, and anti-virus information).
     - Installing a backdoor.
     - Communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server using an encrypted channel.
     - Exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will indeed communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.
     - This is a common and logical sequence in many cyber attacks. Attackers often use encrypted channels to avoid detection by network security tools and to ensure the confidentiality of their communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.
     - This is less likely because unencrypted communication is more easily detected and intercepted by security systems, making the attack less effective and more risky for the attackers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in cyber attacks and the logical sequence of actions described, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
