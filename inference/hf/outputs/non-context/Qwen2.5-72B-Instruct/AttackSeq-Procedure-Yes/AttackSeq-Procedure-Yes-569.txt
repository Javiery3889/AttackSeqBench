### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting basic system information.
     - Searching for Bitcoin wallet addresses.
     - Saving screen recording files in a specific format during the data collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will save screen recording files in the format `[%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi` during the data collection phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not save screen recording files in the format `[%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi` during the data collection phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Collecting Basic System Information:**
     - This is a common initial step for malware to gather information about the infected system, such as OS version, installed software, and network configuration.
   - **Searching for Bitcoin Wallet Addresses:**
     - This is a specific and targeted action, indicating that the malware is designed to steal cryptocurrency.
   - **Saving Screen Recording Files:**
     - Saving screen recording files is a technique used to capture user activities and potentially sensitive information. However, the specific format `[%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi` is not a standard or commonly used format for malware to save screen recordings. Malware typically uses more generic or less detectable formats to avoid raising suspicion.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While it is possible for malware to save screen recordings, the specific format `[%y-%m-%d]%H-%M-%S.avi` is less likely to be used by sophisticated malware. Malware authors often use more obscure or less detectable formats to avoid detection and analysis.

### Final Answer: B: No
