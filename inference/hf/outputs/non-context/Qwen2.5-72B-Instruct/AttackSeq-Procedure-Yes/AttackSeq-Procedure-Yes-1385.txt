### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a reconnaissance phase where an attacker uses tools like masscan to identify specific vulnerabilities in medical infrastructure.
   - The identified targets include Building Management systems with the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online will be identified during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of masscan is a common tool for network scanning and reconnaissance. It can identify open ports, services, and potentially vulnerable systems.
     - Identifying Building Management systems with the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces suggests that the attacker is looking for specific, potentially vulnerable systems.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase typically involves further probing and enumeration of the identified systems to gather more detailed information.
     - Outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online are another set of potential targets that could be identified during this phase.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that the attacker has already identified specific vulnerabilities using masscan, it is reasonable to assume that they would continue to use similar tools and techniques to identify other vulnerable systems.
     - MQTT is a common protocol used in IoT devices, including medical devices. If these devices are outdated and discoverable online, they are likely to be identified during the discovery phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, it is likely that outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online will be identified during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
