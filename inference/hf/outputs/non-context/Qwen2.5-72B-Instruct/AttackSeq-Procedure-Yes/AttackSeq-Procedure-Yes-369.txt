### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers have performed credential dumping using a PowerShell script, likely related to Mimikatz, and have read the memory of lsass.exe.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct system fingerprinting and proceed with domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Dumping and Memory Reading:**
     - Credential dumping, especially using Mimikatz, is a common technique to extract credentials from the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe). This is typically done to gain access to additional systems or to escalate privileges.
   - **System Fingerprinting:**
     - System fingerprinting involves gathering information about the target system, such as the operating system, installed software, and network configuration. This is often done to understand the environment and plan further attacks.
   - **Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - Domain trust discovery is a technique used to identify trust relationships between domains, which can be exploited to move laterally within a network. Tools like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` are commonly used for this purpose.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After obtaining credentials, it is logical for attackers to perform system fingerprinting to understand the environment better.
     - Following system fingerprinting, domain trust discovery is a natural next step to identify potential targets for lateral movement.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression of TTPs, it is highly likely that after credential dumping, attackers will conduct system fingerprinting and proceed with domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
