### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit is delivered via email.
   - The Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlackOasis will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object extracts the exploit.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that BlackOasis will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object extracts the exploit.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - The initial access is gained through the Flash zero-day exploit.
       - Once the exploit is extracted and executed, it is common for attackers to use this initial foothold to execute additional malicious code, such as a second stage shellcode.
       - BlackOasis, known for its sophisticated attack techniques, would likely follow this pattern to maintain persistence and further compromise the system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that BlackOasis will not execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object extracts the exploit.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It would be unusual for an attacker to stop after gaining initial access without further exploiting the system.
       - The purpose of using a zero-day exploit is often to gain a foothold and then execute additional malicious activities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackOasis will execute the second stage shellcode after the Flash object extracts the exploit.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
