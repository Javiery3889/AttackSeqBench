### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access via spear-phishing emails containing trojanized installation executables.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would use process hollowing to execute and evade detection before engaging in discovery activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to gain entry into a victim's system.
   - **Trojanized Installation Executables:**
     - These are legitimate-looking files that, when executed, deploy malware.
   - **Process Hollowing:**
     - Process hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is created in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then the process is resumed. This technique is often used to evade detection by security software.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - After gaining a foothold, malware often performs discovery activities to gather system information and network views to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - Initial Access: Spear-phishing with trojanized executables.
     - Execution: Using process hollowing to evade detection.
     - Discovery: Gathering system information and network views.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that a sophisticated malware like TDrop2 would use process hollowing to execute and evade detection. This technique is commonly used by advanced malware to avoid being detected by security solutions.
     - After evading detection, the malware would likely engage in discovery activities to understand the environment and plan further actions.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
