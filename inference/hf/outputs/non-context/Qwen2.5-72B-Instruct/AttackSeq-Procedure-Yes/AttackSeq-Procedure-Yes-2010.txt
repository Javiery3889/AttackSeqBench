### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering:** Using active discovery methods to identify potential targets.
     - **Phishing Campaign:** Initiating a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Connection:** Establishing a C2 connection through malware on the targeted network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering:** This is typically the first step in any cyber attack. Adversaries use various methods to gather information about potential targets, such as network architecture, employee details, and vulnerabilities.
   - **Phishing Campaign:** After gathering intelligence, adversaries often use phishing to gain initial access to the target network. Phishing is a common technique to trick employees into providing credentials or downloading malware.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Connection:** Once initial access is gained, adversaries need to establish a C2 connection to maintain control over the compromised systems and to exfiltrate data or execute further attacks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering** is the initial step to identify and understand the target.
     - **Phishing Campaign** is a common next step to gain initial access to the target network.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Connection** is established after gaining initial access to maintain control and execute further actions.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is highly plausible that adversaries will initiate a phishing campaign after reconnaissance to gain initial access before establishing a C2 connection. Phishing is a well-known and effective method for gaining initial access, and it is often used in targeted attacks against critical infrastructure like electricity distributors.

### Final Answer:
