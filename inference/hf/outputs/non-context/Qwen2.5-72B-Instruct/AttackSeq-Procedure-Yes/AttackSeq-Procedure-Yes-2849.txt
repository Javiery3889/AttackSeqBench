### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Execution Phase:** PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable and a decoy document.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** The question asks if it is likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - PowerShell scripts are commonly used in the execution phase to download and execute malicious payloads.
     - Downloading a Windows executable and a decoy document is a typical tactic to both execute malware and distract or deceive the user.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The C2 phase involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive further instructions or additional payloads.
     - It is common for malware to download additional files during the C2 phase, but the nature of these files can vary.
     - Downloading an image file containing encoded Asruex malware is a specific and less common scenario. Asruex malware is known to use various methods for C2 communication, but the use of an image file for encoding is not a standard or widely reported technique.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While it is possible for malware to use creative methods for C2 communication, the specific scenario of downloading an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the C2 phase is less likely compared to more common methods.
   - The question asks if it is "likely," and based on the typical behavior of malware and the specific nature of Asruex, the answer is that it is not likely.

### Final Answer: B: No
