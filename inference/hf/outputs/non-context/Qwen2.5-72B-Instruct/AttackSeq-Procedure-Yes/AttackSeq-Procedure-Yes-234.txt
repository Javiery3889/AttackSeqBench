### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a malware infection process.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site.
     - Using a script embedded in a malicious document to initiate the download.
     - Using batch files in a multi-step process.
     - Using a UAC (User Account Control) bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Downloading a base64-encoded CAB file:** This is a common technique used to obfuscate the payload and avoid detection by security software.
       - **Using a script embedded in a malicious document:** Malicious documents often contain scripts (e.g., VBA macros) to download and execute malware.
       - **Using batch files in a multi-step process:** Batch files can be used to automate a series of commands, which is a common technique in multi-stage attacks to maintain stealth and complexity.
       - **Using a UAC bypass module:** UAC bypass techniques are frequently used to gain elevated privileges without alerting the user, which is crucial for executing the main payload with administrative rights.
     - This sequence aligns well with known attack patterns and is a plausible method for malware infection.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is consistent with known malware infection methods and is a plausible attack vector.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is a plausible and common method used in malware infections.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
