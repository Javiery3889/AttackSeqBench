### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Derusbi malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection.
     - Gathering system information about the victim host.
     - Binding to a raw socket.
     - Initiating communication with the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to gain rootkit capabilities and hide its presence on the system.
   - **Step 2: Gathering system information about the victim host:**
     - Malware often gathers system information to understand the environment it is operating in. This information can include details about the operating system, network configuration, and other system properties.
   - **Step 3: Binding to a raw socket:**
     - Binding to a raw socket is a method used to intercept and manipulate network traffic, which can be useful for exfiltrating data or maintaining persistence.
   - **Step 4: Initiating communication with the C2 server:**
     - Once the malware has gathered the necessary information and set up its network capabilities, it will typically communicate with a command and control (C2) server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern in malware operations:
     - **Evade detection** to ensure the malware can operate undetected.
     - **Gather system information** to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - **Set up network capabilities** to communicate with the C2 server.
     - **Initiate communication** with the C2 server to receive commands or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is likely that Derusbi will gather system information about the victim host before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
