### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence initiated by APT28 using a malicious document.
   - The document leverages the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell to execute commands.
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the document creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence of the malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** The malicious document uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **Execution:** The PowerShell commands download and run encoded commands.
   - **Persistence:** The question asks about the likelihood of creating a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DDE and PowerShell Execution:**
     - DDE is a technique used to execute commands within a document, often leading to the execution of PowerShell scripts.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to download and execute additional payloads.
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - Creating a batch file and a registry entry are common techniques used to ensure that malware persists across system reboots.
     - Batch files can be used to run commands or scripts at specific times or events.
     - Registry entries can be used to ensure that certain programs or scripts run at system startup.

4. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**
   - APT28 is known for using sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.
   - After gaining initial execution, it is common for advanced threat actors to establish persistence to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - Creating a batch file and a registry entry are well-documented methods for achieving persistence.

### Final Answer:
Given the sophisticated nature of APT28 and the common use of persistence mechanisms in multi-stage attacks, it is likely to observe the document creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence of the malware on the victim's system.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
