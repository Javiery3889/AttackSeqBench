### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance** using the RMS (Remote Management Software) tool.
     - **Lateral Movement** within the victim network.
     - **Defense Evasion** to avoid detection.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server located in Germany using application layer protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:**
     - RMS tools are often used for legitimate remote management but can be repurposed by attackers for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
     - This is a common TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the categories of "Reconnaissance" and "Lateral Movement."
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Attackers often use various techniques to evade detection, such as obfuscation, living off the land, and using legitimate tools in malicious ways.
     - This aligns with the "Defense Evasion" category in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - After establishing a foothold and moving laterally, attackers typically need to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
     - C2 communication often uses application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
     - The location of the C2 server (in this case, Germany) is not unusual, as attackers may use servers in various locations to obfuscate their true origin and avoid geographically based defenses.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described and the common practice of attackers to communicate with C2 servers using application layer protocols, it is likely that the RMS executable attempted to communicate with a C2 server located in Germany.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
