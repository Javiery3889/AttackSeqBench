### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SideWinder APT group.
   - The initial access was gained via CVE-2019-2215 through malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group used exploits from the C&C (Command and Control) server, such as CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU, to root devices for privilege escalation.
   - Finally, it asks if the group employed techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play is a known and plausible method. CVE-2019-2215 is a vulnerability in the Android operating system that can be exploited to gain code execution.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Using exploits from the C&C server to root devices for privilege escalation is a common next step in many APT attacks. CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU (a known exploit for rooting Android devices) are both plausible tools for this purpose.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation are standard methods used by APT groups to evade detection by security software and analysts.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play is a well-documented method. This is a plausible and common initial vector for APT groups.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Once initial access is gained, APT groups often seek to escalate privileges to gain more control over the compromised system. Using exploits like CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU from the C&C server to root devices is a logical and common next step.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - To maintain persistence and avoid detection, APT groups frequently use techniques such as obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation. These techniques help to hide the presence of the malware and the activities of the attackers.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of TTPs described and the common practices of APT groups, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
