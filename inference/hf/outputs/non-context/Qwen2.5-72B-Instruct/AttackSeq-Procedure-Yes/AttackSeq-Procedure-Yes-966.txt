### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Naikon APT group has used the Aria-body backdoor to gather detailed system and network information during the Discovery tactic.
   - The question then asks whether the group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control (C2) stage.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:** The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather detailed system and network information. This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Discovery phase.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Tactic:** After gathering information, the next logical step for an APT group is to establish and maintain command and control over the compromised system. This involves sending collected data back to the attacker and receiving additional commands.
   - **HTTP and TCP Protocols:** HTTP and TCP are commonly used protocols for C2 communications because they are widely used and can blend in with normal network traffic, making them less likely to be detected by network security systems.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the Naikon APT group is unlikely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for C2 communications.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the common use of HTTP and TCP protocols in C2 communications and the fact that these protocols are effective for blending in with normal traffic, it is highly plausible that the Naikon APT group would use these protocols.
   - The Aria-body backdoor, being a sophisticated tool, is likely designed to use common protocols to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
