### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter' is used to execute the SideTwist payload every 5 minutes.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C (Command and Control) server using encrypted HTTP channels.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - The use of a scheduled task to execute a payload is a common persistence technique (MITRE ATT&CK T1053: Scheduled Task/Job). This ensures that the payload is executed regularly, maintaining the attacker's presence on the system.
   - **SideTwist Payload:**
     - SideTwist is a known backdoor that can be used for various malicious activities, including communication with a C&C server.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Communication with a C&C server is a critical step in maintaining control over the compromised system. Attackers often use encrypted channels to avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Encrypted HTTP Channels:**
     - Encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) is a common method for securing communications. It provides confidentiality and integrity, making it harder for network defenders to inspect the traffic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that SideTwist is a sophisticated backdoor, it is highly likely that it would use encrypted channels to communicate with the C&C server to avoid detection.
   - The use of HTTPS (encrypted HTTP) is a standard practice in modern malware to ensure that the communication is not easily intercepted or analyzed by network security tools.
