### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sayad malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Discovery:** Collecting system and application details from the compromised host.
     2. **Data Collection:** Capturing screenshots.
     3. **Exfiltration:** Sending the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1082, T1016, T1033, etc.):** This is a common initial step in many malware attacks where the malware gathers information about the compromised system to understand its environment and capabilities.
   - **Data Collection (T1113, T1115, etc.):** Capturing screenshots is a form of data collection that can provide attackers with visual information about the compromised system, which can be useful for further exploitation or reconnaissance.
   - **Exfiltration (T1041, T1020, etc.):** After collecting the data, the malware needs to send it back to the attacker's server. This is typically the final step in the sequence.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - It is logical for malware to perform discovery first to understand the environment.
   - Capturing screenshots as part of data collection is a common technique used by malware to gather additional information.
   - Exfiltration is the final step where the collected data is sent to the attacker's server.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery, capturing screenshots, exfiltration) is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs for malware like Sayad.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
