### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 (Command and Control) servers, followed by the potential deployment of the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware.
   - The 'Apostle' wiper is mentioned as having initially failed execution.
   - The 'DEADWOOD' malware is described as being used to overwrite files as part of data destruction activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
     - Given that the 'Apostle' wiper initially failed execution, it is plausible that the attackers would attempt to deploy it again, possibly with modifications to ensure successful execution.
     - The deployment of 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files aligns with the goal of data destruction, which is a common objective in cyber attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Agrius is not likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware.
     - This choice seems less plausible because it contradicts the typical behavior of attackers who often persist in their efforts to achieve their objectives, even if initial attempts fail.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
