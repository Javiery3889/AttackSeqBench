### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Charming Kitten using a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists to send socially engineered email messages for initial access.
     2. Creating phishing websites that impersonate Instagram and Google services for credential theft.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Impersonation of Researchers/Journalists:**
     - Charming Kitten is known for using sophisticated social engineering techniques, including impersonating trusted individuals to gain initial access. This is a common tactic in spear-phishing campaigns.
   - **Phishing Websites:**
     - Once initial access is gained, it is common for threat actors to escalate their activities. Creating phishing websites to steal credentials is a logical next step, especially if the initial access is used to gather more information about the target.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. It follows a logical progression where the initial access is gained through social engineering, and then the attacker uses that access to set up more sophisticated attacks, such as phishing websites.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly likely to be used by Charming Kitten.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
