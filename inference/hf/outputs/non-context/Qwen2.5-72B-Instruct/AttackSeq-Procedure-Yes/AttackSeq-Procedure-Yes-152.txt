### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PowerLess Backdoor.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Credential Access**: Dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
     - **Credential Access**: Utilizing a keylogger.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerLess Backdoor will target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery after achieving credential access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: Dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' is a technique (T1003) that involves extracting credentials from the operating system. This is a common method for gaining access to user credentials.
   - **Credential Access**: Utilizing a keylogger (T1056) is another technique that captures keystrokes to gather sensitive information, including credentials.
   - **Account Discovery**: After gaining credentials, it is common for malware to perform account discovery (T1087) to identify and enumerate local user accounts on the compromised system. This helps the attacker understand the environment and potentially escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor has already achieved credential access using two methods: dumping OS credentials and keylogging.
   - Once the attacker has obtained credentials, the next logical step is to discover and enumerate local user accounts to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - Account discovery is a crucial step in the attack chain, as it provides the attacker with a list of potential targets for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
