### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malware, presumably named "Longhorn," is configured to use a specific domain and IP address combination for Command and Control (C&C) communication over HTTPS.
   - The communication uses a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that this malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
     - Given the sophisticated nature of the C&C communication (specific domain and IP, HTTPS, custom cryptographic protocol), it is plausible that the malware would also employ advanced techniques to avoid detection, such as scheduled exfiltration and randomized intervals.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
     - This seems less likely given the sophisticated setup described. Malware that uses such advanced techniques for C&C communication is often designed to be stealthy and avoid detection, which would include scheduled exfiltration and randomized intervals.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the sophisticated nature of the C&C communication, is that the malware will indeed communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
