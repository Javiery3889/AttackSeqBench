### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
     - **Resource Development:** Acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY.
     - **Execution:** Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the known TTPs of many threat actors, including FamousSparrow.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Acquiring infrastructure from specific hosting providers is a step that typically occurs before the initial access to ensure the attacker has the necessary resources to conduct the attack. However, the question suggests that this step happens after gaining initial access, which is less common and less logical.
   - **Execution:**
     - Using `cmd.exe` to download and install a backdoor is a typical post-exploitation technique. This step logically follows gaining initial access.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that FamousSparrow would acquire infrastructure after gaining initial access, which is not a typical or logical sequence. Usually, resource development (acquiring infrastructure) happens before the initial access to ensure the attacker has the necessary resources to conduct the attack.
   - The more logical sequence would be:
     1. **Resource Development:** Acquire infrastructure.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities.
     3. **Execution:** Use `cmd.exe` to download and install the backdoor.

### Final Answer:
B: No
