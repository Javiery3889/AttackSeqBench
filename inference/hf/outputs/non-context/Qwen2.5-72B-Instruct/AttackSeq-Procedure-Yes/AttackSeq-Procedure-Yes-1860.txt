### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by QuasarRAT.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Obfuscation and Encryption:** Using techniques like CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx to evade detection.
     - **Communication with C2 Server:** Using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Encryption:**
     - CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx are known tools used to obfuscate and encrypt malware to avoid detection by security software.
     - These techniques are commonly used in advanced malware to make analysis and detection more difficult.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:**
     - AES-128 is a strong encryption standard that is often used to secure communication channels.
     - It is common for sophisticated malware, including RATs (Remote Access Trojans), to use encrypted channels to communicate with C2 servers to avoid network-based detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given that QuasarRAT is a sophisticated piece of malware, it is highly likely that it would use strong encryption to secure its communication with the C2 server.
   - The use of AES-128 encryption aligns with the advanced nature of the obfuscation and encryption techniques already mentioned (CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
