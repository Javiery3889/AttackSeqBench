### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     1. Obtaining SSH access to the target system.
     2. Using `wget` to fetch malware samples.
     3. Dropping the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk.
     4. Loading the Turbo Linux Kernel Module into the kernel.
     5. Deleting the Turbo Linux Kernel Module by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is plausible.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **SSH Access:** This is a common initial access technique.
       - **Using `wget` to fetch malware:** This is a common technique for downloading additional components or payloads.
       - **Dropping the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk:** This is a plausible step, as the malware needs to be present on the system to be loaded.
       - **Loading the Turbo Linux Kernel Module into the kernel:** This is a common technique for rootkits to gain deeper access and persistence.
       - **Deleting the Turbo Linux Kernel Module by the Derusbi malware:** This is a plausible step to avoid detection, as removing the file from disk can make it harder for forensic analysis to identify the malware.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of actions described in the question is not plausible.
     - If we consider the sequence:
       - The steps of obtaining SSH access, using `wget`, and dropping the module to disk are all common and logical.
       - Loading the module into the kernel is a logical next step for a rootkit.
       - Deleting the module to avoid detection is also a common technique used by sophisticated malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common nature of each step in the sequence, it is plausible that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and subsequently deleted by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
