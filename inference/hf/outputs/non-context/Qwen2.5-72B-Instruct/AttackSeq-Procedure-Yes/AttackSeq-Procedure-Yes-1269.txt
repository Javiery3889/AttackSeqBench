### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary (Yellow Garuda) achieves initial access using macro-enabled template files hosted on third-party services as phishing lures.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the same adversary will disrupt analysis efforts during defense evasion by remotely staging parts of the infection chain and employing RC4-encrypted strings.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of macro-enabled template files hosted on third-party services as phishing lures is a common technique for initial access. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1193 (Spearphishing Attachment) and T1204.002 (User Execution - Malicious File).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Disrupting analysis efforts is a common goal during defense evasion. Techniques such as remote staging of parts of the infection chain and using encryption (like RC4) to obfuscate strings are typical methods to evade detection and analysis.
     - Remote staging (T1114 - Email Collection, T1029 - Steganography, T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer) and encryption (T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information) are well-documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the adversary has already used sophisticated techniques for initial access, it is plausible that they would continue to use advanced techniques for defense evasion to maintain their foothold and avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible. The use of macro-enabled templates for initial access and the subsequent use of remote staging and RC4 encryption for defense evasion are consistent with the behavior of sophisticated adversaries.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
