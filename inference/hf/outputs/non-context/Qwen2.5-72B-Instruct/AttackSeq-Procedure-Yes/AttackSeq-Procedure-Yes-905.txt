### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Process Hollowing:** A technique where an attacker creates a new process in a suspended state, replaces its memory with malicious code, and then resumes the process. This is often used to execute malicious code within the context of a legitimate process.
     - **Fileless Techniques:** Methods that do not rely on writing files to disk, which can help evade detection by traditional file-based security solutions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing:** This technique is commonly used to evade detection by running malicious code within the memory of a legitimate process. It is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Fileless Techniques:** These techniques are also used for defense evasion, as they avoid leaving traces on the file system, making it harder for security tools to detect the malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Dexphot Malware:** Dexphot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques. It has been observed using a combination of process hollowing and fileless techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** Given that Dexphot uses process hollowing to load executables into legitimate processes, it is highly likely that it would also use fileless techniques to further obfuscate its activities and prevent detection.
   - **Consistency with Known Behavior:** The use of fileless techniques aligns with the known behavior of Dexphot, which aims to remain undetected for as long as possible.

### Final Answer:
