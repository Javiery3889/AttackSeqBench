### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where a malicious macro injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access with Sharpshooter Downloader:**
     - Sharpshooter is a known downloader that can be used to inject malicious code into the memory of applications like Word. This is a common technique for initial access.
   - **Rising Sun Implant:**
     - Rising Sun is a sophisticated implant that is often used in multi-stage attacks. It is designed to maintain persistence and facilitate further malicious activities.
   - **Second-Stage Payload:**
     - In many advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, initial access tools like Sharpshooter are used to download and execute more sophisticated implants like Rising Sun. These implants often have the capability to download additional payloads to extend their functionality and maintain persistence.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given the nature of Rising Sun as a sophisticated implant, it is highly likely that it would download a second-stage payload to perform additional tasks such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further exploitation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that the Rising Sun implant will download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
