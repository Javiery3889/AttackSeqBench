### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence starts with reconnaissance activities using the DOCKERGEDDON function to scan netblocks, detect misconfigured Docker APIs, and deploy malicious containers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will leverage compromised websites to host malicious files to develop their attacker infrastructure, before exploiting vulnerabilities using open-source and offensive security tools during resource development.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Compromise:**
     - The use of DOCKERGEDDON to scan netblocks and detect misconfigured Docker APIs is a common reconnaissance technique. This helps attackers identify potential targets with weak security configurations.
     - Deploying malicious containers on these misconfigured APIs is a logical next step, as it allows the attacker to gain a foothold in the target environment.

   - **Leveraging Compromised Websites:**
     - Once the initial compromise is achieved, attackers often need to establish a persistent presence and develop their infrastructure. Hosting malicious files on compromised websites is a common technique to achieve this.
     - Compromised websites can serve as a reliable and often undetected platform for hosting malware, command and control (C2) servers, and other malicious resources.

   - **Resource Development and Exploitation:**
     - After setting up their infrastructure, attackers typically use a variety of tools and techniques to further exploit the target. This includes using open-source and offensive security tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
     - These tools can help in gaining deeper access, escalating privileges, and exfiltrating data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression from reconnaissance to initial compromise, to infrastructure development, and finally to exploitation, it is highly likely that attackers will leverage compromised websites to host malicious files and use various tools for resource development.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
