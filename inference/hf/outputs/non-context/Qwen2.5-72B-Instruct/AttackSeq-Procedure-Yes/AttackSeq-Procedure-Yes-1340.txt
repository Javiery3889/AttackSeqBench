### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a Flash zero-day exploit.
   - The exploit gains arbitrary read/write memory capabilities.
   - This capability is used to execute a second stage shellcode.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the second stage shellcode will then download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploit (Flash zero-day):** This is a common initial attack vector used to gain a foothold in the target system.
   - **Arbitrary Read/Write Memory Capabilities:** Once the exploit is successful, it gains the ability to manipulate memory, which is crucial for executing further stages of the attack.
   - **Second Stage Shellcode:** This is typically used to perform more complex tasks, such as downloading additional payloads or establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **Downloading Final Payload (FinSpy):** FinSpy is a known advanced malware that often requires a multi-stage attack to be deployed. The second stage shellcode is a logical step to download and execute the final payload.
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers:** Once the final payload is downloaded, it is common for the malware to establish communication with a C2 server to receive further commands and maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in multi-stage attacks, it is highly likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
