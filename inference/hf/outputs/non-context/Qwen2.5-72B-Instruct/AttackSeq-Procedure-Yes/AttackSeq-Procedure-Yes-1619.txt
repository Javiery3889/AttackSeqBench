### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, a dropper is executed to enable system compromise.
   - The question then asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing and Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known for using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to target systems. This is a common TTP for APT28 and aligns with the first part of the attack sequence.
   - **Dropper Execution:**
     - Once initial access is gained, APT28 often uses droppers to deploy additional malware and enable further system compromise. This is also a known TTP and aligns with the second part of the attack sequence.
   - **Discovery Process:**
     - During the discovery process, APT28 typically aims to gather information about the compromised system and the network. This can involve various techniques such as network scanning, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.
   - **Geographically Distributed Bots:**
     - APT28 is known for using sophisticated command and control (C2) infrastructure, which can include geographically distributed bots. These bots can be used to report back to a central server, helping to maintain communication and control over the compromised systems.
     - Using geographically distributed bots can help APT28 evade detection and maintain persistence, as it can make it more difficult for defenders to block or trace the C2 traffic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of APT28 and their known use of geographically distributed C2 infrastructure, it is highly likely that they would use such bots during the discovery process to report back to a central server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
