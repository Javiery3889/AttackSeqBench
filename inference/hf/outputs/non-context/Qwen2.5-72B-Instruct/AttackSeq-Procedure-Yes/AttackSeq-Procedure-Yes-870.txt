### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where GreyEnergy uses spearphishing emails and compromises public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if GreyEnergy is likely to implement stealth techniques, including:
     - Pushing only selected modules to selected targets.
     - Partially encrypting these modules using AES-256.
     - Running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing and Compromising Web Servers:**
     - These are common initial access techniques used by advanced threat actors like GreyEnergy. Spearphishing is a targeted method to gain access to a network, and compromising public-facing web servers can provide a foothold in the target environment.
   - **Stealth Techniques:**
     - **Pushing Selected Modules:**
       - Advanced threat actors often use this technique to minimize their footprint and avoid detection. By only deploying specific modules to specific targets, they reduce the risk of being discovered.
     - **Partial Encryption with AES-256:**
       - Encrypting modules can make it difficult for security tools to analyze the content of the modules. AES-256 is a strong encryption standard that can effectively obfuscate the modules.
     - **Fileless Execution:**
       - Running modules in memory without writing them to disk is a common technique to evade detection by traditional antivirus and endpoint protection solutions. Fileless execution can make it harder for security tools to detect and analyze the malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the advanced nature of GreyEnergy and the described techniques, it is highly likely that they would implement these stealth techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
