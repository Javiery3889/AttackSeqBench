### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors conducted research on their targets before sending phishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - The key elements are:
     - Phishing emails with malicious attachments.
     - Research on targets to craft convincing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Conducting research on targets is a common and effective strategy in phishing campaigns. This research can include gathering information about the target's organization, job roles, recent events, and personal details to make the phishing emails more convincing.
     - This step is often referred to as "reconnaissance" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is the initial phase of many cyber attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If threat actors do not conduct research, the phishing emails are less likely to be convincing and more likely to be detected by the targets.
     - Without research, the success rate of the phishing campaign is generally lower.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Phishing campaigns are more effective when the emails are tailored to the targets.
   - **Step 2:** Tailoring emails requires research to gather relevant information about the targets.
   - **Step 3:** Research is a common and recommended step in the reconnaissance phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Step 4:** Therefore, it is highly likely that threat actors would conduct research before sending phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
