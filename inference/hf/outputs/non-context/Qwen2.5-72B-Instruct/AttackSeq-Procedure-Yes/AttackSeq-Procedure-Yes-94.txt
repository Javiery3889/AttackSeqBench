### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document.
     - Downloading an HTA file.
     - Using the HTA file to check for antivirus software using WMI.
     - Communicating with the C2 (Command and Control) server.
     - Using DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited through RTF (Rich Text Format) documents to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Downloading an HTA file:**
     - HTA (HTML Application) files can be used to execute scripts and other code on a victim's machine.
   - **Using the HTA file to check for antivirus software using WMI:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) can be used to query system information, including the presence of antivirus software.
   - **Communicating with the C2 server:**
     - Once the initial foothold is established, the malware typically communicates with a C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - **Using DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe for defense evasion:**
     - DLL sideloading is a technique where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. Srvstr.exe is a legitimate Windows service, and sideloading a malicious DLL can help evade detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described is a common and logical progression in a cyber attack:
     - **Initial Exploit:** CVE-2017-11882 is used to gain initial access.
     - **Download and Execute:** An HTA file is downloaded and executed to perform further actions.
     - **Reconnaissance:** The HTA file checks for antivirus software using WMI to avoid detection.
     - **C2 Communication:** The malware communicates with the C2 server to receive further instructions.
     - **Defense Evasion:** DLL sideloading is used to execute Srvstr.exe, which helps in evading defenses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common sequence of TTPs described, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
