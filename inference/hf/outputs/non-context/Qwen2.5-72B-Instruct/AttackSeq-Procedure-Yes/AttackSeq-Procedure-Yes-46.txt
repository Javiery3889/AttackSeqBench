### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails.
   - The emails contain a malicious Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
   - The question asks if it is likely that VBS macros will be executed from the embedded document after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Emails:** Phishing is a common initial access technique (T1192 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework) where attackers send emails to victims to trick them into performing actions, such as opening a malicious attachment.
   - **Malicious Microsoft Word Document:** The document 'Richard_Johnson.doc' is described as malicious, which suggests it contains some form of malicious content.
   - **VBS Macros:** VBS (Visual Basic Script) macros are a common payload in malicious documents. When a user opens the document, the macros can execute, leading to further malicious activities.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. The attacker sends phishing emails to the victims.
     2. The victims open the emails and click on the attachment ('Richard_Johnson.doc').
     3. The document contains VBS macros.
     4. When the document is opened, the VBS macros are executed, leading to the next stage of the attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of VBS macros in malicious documents and the typical sequence of events in phishing campaigns, it is highly likely that the VBS macros will be executed from the embedded document after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
