### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Scanning for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
     2. Targeting user credentials using tools such as procdump and Mimikatz.
     3. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning for Machines:**
     - Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan are commonly used for network scanning and reconnaissance. This is a typical first step in many cyber attacks to identify potential targets.
   - **Targeting User Credentials:**
     - Tools like procdump and Mimikatz are used to extract user credentials from memory. This is a common technique used after gaining initial access to a system to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - **Exploiting Remote Services:**
     - Once credentials are obtained, threat actors often use them to exploit remote services (e.g., RDP, SMB) to move laterally within the network.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Scanning for Machines):** Identify potential targets.
     2. **Credential Access (Targeting User Credentials):** Gain access to user credentials.
     3. **Lateral Movement (Exploiting Remote Services):** Use the credentials to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the common attack pattern, it is likely that Earth Lusca will follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
