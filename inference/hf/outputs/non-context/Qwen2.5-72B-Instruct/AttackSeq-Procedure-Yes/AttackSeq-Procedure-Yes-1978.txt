### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access phase where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT are sent.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary sends emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT.
   - **Resource Development:** The adversary uses compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This phase is typical in many cyber attacks, where adversaries use social engineering techniques (like phishing emails) to gain initial access to a target network.
   - **Resource Development:** This phase involves the adversary preparing the infrastructure needed to support the attack, such as hosting malicious scripts and command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Logical Sequence:** After gaining initial access, it is common for adversaries to set up additional infrastructure to maintain persistence and control over the compromised network. Using compromised webservers to host delivery scripts and VPSs to host C2s is a plausible and common practice in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices in APT operations, it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
