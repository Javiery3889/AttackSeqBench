### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Grandoreiro, a known malware, will collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, after employing techniques such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** Employing API hooking and detecting virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.
   - **Subsequent TTPs:** Collecting information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **API Hooking:** This technique is often used by malware to intercept and manipulate function calls, which can help in evading detection by security software.
   - **Detection of Virtual Environments:** Malware often checks for virtual environments to avoid analysis by security researchers.
   - **Information Collection:** After evading detection, it is common for malware to gather information about the victim's system to understand the environment and plan further actions.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **API Hooking and Virtual Environment Detection:** These are typical initial steps for sophisticated malware to ensure it can operate undetected.
   - **Information Collection:** Once the malware has evaded detection, it is highly likely that it will collect information about the victim's system to tailor its actions and avoid being detected by security products.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Grandoreiro and the common sequence of TTPs in malware operations, it is highly likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer after employing API hooking and virtual environment detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
