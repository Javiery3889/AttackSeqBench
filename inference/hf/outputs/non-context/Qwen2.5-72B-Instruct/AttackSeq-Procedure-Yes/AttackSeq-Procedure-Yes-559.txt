### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with bypassing User Account Control (UAC) using a .NET technique during the execution phase.
   - The question then asks if the malware is likely to collect basic information (IP address and hostname) during the discovery phase before engaging in more detailed collection activities (keystrokes, clipboard data, and screen activity).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Bypassing UAC is a common technique used to gain higher privileges on a system. This is part of the execution phase.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - After gaining higher privileges, the next logical step for an attacker is to gather basic information about the compromised system. This includes the IP address and hostname, which are essential for understanding the network environment and the identity of the compromised machine.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Once the basic information is collected, the attacker can then proceed to more detailed collection activities such as recording keystrokes, clipboard data, and screen activity. These activities are typically part of the collection phase and are used to gather sensitive information.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Execution:** Bypass UAC to gain higher privileges.
     2. **Discovery:** Collect basic information (IP address, hostname) to understand the environment.
     3. **Collection:** Engage in detailed data collection (keystrokes, clipboard data, screen activity).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is highly likely that the malware would collect basic information during the discovery phase before moving on to detailed collection activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
