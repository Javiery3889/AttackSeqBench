### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying malware components (downloaders, stealers, keyloggers).
     - Using sophisticated capabilities (signing backdoors with digital certificates, encrypting gathered data).
     - Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is likely.
     - Darkhotel APT is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - Signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data are advanced techniques used for defense evasion.
     - Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services is a common tactic for credential access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence is unlikely.
     - However, given the known capabilities and sophistication of Darkhotel APT, this choice seems less plausible.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - Darkhotel APT is a well-documented threat actor known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.
   - Deploying malware components such as downloaders, stealers, and keyloggers is a common initial step in their attack lifecycle.
   - Using advanced techniques like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data is consistent with their known methods of defense evasion.
   - Targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access is a logical next step to gain deeper access and maintain persistence.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question aligns well with the known TTPs of Darkhotel APT.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
