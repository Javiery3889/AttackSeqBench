### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using `PORT.EXE` and `STSRCheck` for network scanning and discovery.
     - Using 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
     - Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using `POWSSHNET` for command and control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Scanning and Discovery:**
     - `PORT.EXE` and `STSRCheck` are tools used for scanning ports and mapping the internal network. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target network.
   - **Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attack:**
     - 'Invoke the Hash' is a technique used to perform pass-the-hash attacks, which involve using stolen password hashes to authenticate and move laterally within a network. This is a logical next step after network discovery, as the attacker would use the discovered information to find potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **RDP over SSH Tunneling:**
     - Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using `POWSSHNET` is a method to maintain command and control (C2) over compromised systems. This is typically done after gaining access to a target system and establishing a foothold, which can be achieved through lateral movement techniques like pass-the-hash.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - The use of `PORT.EXE` and `STSRCheck` for network scanning and discovery is a standard initial step in many cyber attacks. This helps the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After discovering the network, the attacker would likely use the information gathered to perform pass-the-hash attacks using 'Invoke the Hash'. This allows the attacker to move laterally within the network, gaining access to additional systems.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Once the attacker has gained access to multiple systems, they would establish a more robust C2 channel. Using RDP over SSH tunneling with `POWSSHNET` is a sophisticated method to maintain control over the compromised systems while evading detection.
