### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using HTTP protocol to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
     - Sending localization data and keyboard layout information to the C2 server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will then function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the malware will function as a network sniffer and exfiltrate gathered information.
     - BlackEnergy 3 is known for its modular architecture, which allows it to perform various functions, including network sniffing and data exfiltration.
     - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C2 server and is sending specific data (localization and keyboard layout), it is plausible that it could be configured to perform additional tasks such as network sniffing.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the malware will function as a network sniffer and exfiltrate gathered information.
     - While this is possible, it is less likely given the modular nature of BlackEnergy 3 and its known capabilities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the modular nature of BlackEnergy 3 and its known capabilities, it is plausible that the malware could function as a network sniffer and exfiltrate gathered information as part of its exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
