### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is achieved through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via spear-phishing.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the DNSpionage malware will execute a PE file before maintaining persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents. This is a common technique (T1192: Spearphishing Attachment) used by attackers to gain a foothold in a target's system.
   - **Execution of PE File:**
     - Once the malicious document is opened, it is likely that the malware will execute a PE (Portable Executable) file. This is a common next step in the attack chain, where the malware drops and executes a malicious payload (T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1204: User Execution).
   - **Persistence:**
     - After executing the PE file, the malware will likely attempt to maintain persistence. One common method is to create a scheduled task (T1053: Scheduled Task/Job). The specific name 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' is a plausible name for a scheduled task, as it appears legitimate and is likely to avoid suspicion.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in a malware attack, it is highly likely that the DNSpionage malware will execute a PE file before creating a scheduled task for persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
