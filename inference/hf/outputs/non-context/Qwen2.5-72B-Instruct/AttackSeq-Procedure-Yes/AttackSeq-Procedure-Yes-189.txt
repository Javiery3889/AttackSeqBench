### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Infamous Chisel's netd component.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Enumerating multiple directories and gathering system information.
     - **Collection Phase:** Potentially collecting files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The netd component is known to perform discovery activities, such as enumerating directories and gathering system information. This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Discovery" tactic (T1083, T1057, etc.).
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The question asks whether the netd component will automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.
     - In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the "Collection" tactic (T1114, T1005, etc.) involves gathering data of interest to the adversary from the system.
     - While the netd component is capable of collecting files, the question specifically asks about automatic collection based on a predefined list of file extensions.
     - The netd component is typically used for more general data exfiltration and may not have a predefined list of file extensions for automatic collection. Instead, it often relies on commands or configurations provided by the attacker.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is less likely that the netd component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase. The collection is more likely to be driven by specific commands or configurations provided by the attacker rather than an automated, predefined list.

**Final Answer: B: No**
