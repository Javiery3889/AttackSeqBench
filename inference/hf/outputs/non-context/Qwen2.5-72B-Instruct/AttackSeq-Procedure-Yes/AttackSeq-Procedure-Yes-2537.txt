### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milestone backdoor and asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.
   - Key TTPs mentioned:
     - **Persistence:** Copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Using the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to perform Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM).
     - **Discovery:** System information discovery.
     - **Collection:** Screen capture functionalities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to a specific location and creating a service in the registry. This is a common technique used by malware to maintain access to the system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for DKOM. DKOM is a sophisticated technique used to hide the presence of malware by directly manipulating kernel objects, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **Discovery and Collection:** After ensuring persistence and evading defenses, the next logical steps would be to gather system information and capture screens, which are typical activities for reconnaissance and data exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Plausibility of DKOM:** Deploying a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili for DKOM is a high-level technique that is often used by advanced threat actors to maintain stealth and avoid detection. Given that Deep Panda is known for using sophisticated techniques, it is plausible that they would use such a method.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described (persistence, defense evasion, discovery, and collection) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks. Ensuring persistence and evading defenses are typically early steps, followed by reconnaissance and data collection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
