### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access by delivering an ISO file.
   - The sequence ends with achieving persistence by scheduling the 'install.vbs' script to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'.
   - The question asks if it is likely that various VBScripts and batch files, such as 'install.vbs', will execute scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Konni APT Group gains initial access by delivering an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL. This is a common method for delivering malware.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The group achieves persistence by scheduling the 'install.vbs' script to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'. This is a typical method for ensuring that the malware remains active on the system.
   - **Intermediate Steps:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that various VBScripts and batch files, such as 'install.vbs', will execute scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' as part of their attack sequence.
     - It is common for malware to use multiple scripts and batch files to perform various tasks, such as resolving domain names, stopping services, and scheduling tasks.
     - 'resolve.dns' could be used to resolve domain names for command and control (C2) communication.
     - 'stopedge.bat' could be used to stop or manipulate services to ensure the malware runs smoothly.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The ISO file is delivered and executed, likely containing the initial payload.
   - **Execution of Scripts:**
     - The initial payload may include or download additional scripts, such as 'install.vbs', 'resolve.dns', and 'stopedge.bat'.
     - 'resolve.dns' could be used to resolve C2 server addresses.
     - 'install.vbs' could be used to install and configure the malware.
     - 'stopedge.bat' could be used to stop or manipulate services to ensure the malware runs without interference.
   - **Persistence:**
     - 'install.vbs' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat' to maintain persistence.
