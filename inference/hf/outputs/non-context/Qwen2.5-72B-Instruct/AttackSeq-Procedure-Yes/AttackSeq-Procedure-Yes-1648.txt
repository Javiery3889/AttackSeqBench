### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack using a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller, leveraging an Internet Explorer zero-day for initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attack group will:
     - Adopt and customize several Android backdoors.
     - Utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control (C2).
     - Deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access method (watering hole attack using an Internet Explorer zero-day) is a sophisticated and targeted approach. This suggests a well-resourced and capable attack group.
   - **Adopting and Customizing Android Backdoors:**
     - While it is possible for a sophisticated group to adopt and customize Android backdoors, this step seems less likely given the initial attack vector. The initial attack targeted a software reseller using a web browser vulnerability, which is more aligned with targeting desktop or server environments rather than mobile devices.
   - **Utilizing a Massive C2 Infrastructure:**
     - A sophisticated attack group would likely use a robust and scalable C2 infrastructure to manage their operations, especially if they are conducting a multi-stage attack. This is a plausible step.
   - **Deploying Second-Stage Backdoors with Hardcoded Proxy Addresses and Credentials:**
     - Deploying second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials is a common tactic to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. However, using hardcoded credentials can be risky and less sophisticated groups might do this, but a well-resourced group would likely use more dynamic and secure methods.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The initial attack vector (watering hole attack with a zero-day) suggests a highly capable and sophisticated group.
   - While using a massive C2 infrastructure and deploying second-stage backdoors are plausible, adopting and customizing Android backdoors seems less aligned with the initial attack vector and target.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not the most likely scenario given the initial attack method.

### Final Answer: B: No
