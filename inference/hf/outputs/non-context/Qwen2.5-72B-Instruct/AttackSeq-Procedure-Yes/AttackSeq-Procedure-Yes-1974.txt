### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors use phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion to further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain.
   - It specifically asks whether it is likely that these threat actors, who have targeted SolarWinds and Kaseya, will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Threat actors targeting high-profile organizations like SolarWinds and Kaseya are typically sophisticated and well-resourced. They often engage in thorough reconnaissance to understand the target's environment, network structure, and potential vulnerabilities.
     - Gathering victim organization information is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, especially for advanced persistent threats (APTs). This information helps them tailor their attacks, avoid detection, and maximize the impact of their actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the threat actors would not gather victim organization information, which is less likely given the sophistication and strategic nature of attacks on SolarWinds and Kaseya.
     - Without proper reconnaissance, the threat actors would have a much harder time executing successful and targeted attacks, especially in a supply chain context where understanding the relationships and dependencies between organizations is critical.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is that threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya will indeed gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
