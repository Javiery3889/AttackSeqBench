### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Accessing the victim's VPN using credentials obtained through password spraying.
     2. Installing a Cobalt Strike beacon using a PowerShell one-liner.
     3. Leveraging scheduled tasks to execute a batch file for their tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Accessing the Victim's VPN Using Password Spraying:**
     - Password spraying is a technique where an attacker uses a single password against multiple accounts to avoid account lockout policies. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Installing Cobalt Strike Beacon Using PowerShell:**
     - Cobalt Strike is a popular penetration testing tool that can be used for post-exploitation activities. Installing it using a PowerShell one-liner is a common method to gain a foothold in the network.
   - **Leveraging Scheduled Tasks to Execute a Batch File:**
     - Scheduled tasks can be used to maintain persistence by ensuring that the adversary's tools or scripts are executed at regular intervals. This is a common technique for maintaining access and automating tasks.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible:
     - **Initial Access:** Password spraying is a common method to gain initial access to a network.
     - **Execution and Persistence:** Once access is gained, installing a Cobalt Strike beacon using PowerShell is a logical next step to establish a foothold.
     - **Persistence and Automation:** Leveraging scheduled tasks to execute a batch file is a common technique to ensure that the adversary's tools or scripts are run regularly, maintaining persistence and automating tasks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
