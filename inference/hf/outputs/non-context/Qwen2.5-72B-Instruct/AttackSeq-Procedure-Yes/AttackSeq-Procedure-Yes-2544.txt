### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Milestone backdoor exfiltrating data over the C2 (Command and Control) channel after performing discovery and screen capture activities.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Discovering system information
     - Capturing the screen
     - Exfiltrating data over the C2 channel

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:**
     - Discovering system information is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This helps the attacker understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
   - **Screen Capture:**
     - Capturing the screen is often used to gather visual information about the system, which can be useful for further exploitation or to understand the context of the system.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating data over the C2 channel is a logical next step after gathering information. The C2 channel is used to send commands to the infected system and to receive data from it.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery, screen capture, and exfiltration) is a common and logical progression in a cyber attack.
   - After discovering system information and capturing the screen, the attacker would likely want to exfiltrate the gathered data to their C2 server for further analysis or to use in subsequent attacks.
   - The Milestone backdoor, being a sophisticated piece of malware, is designed to perform these tasks in a coordinated manner to achieve its objectives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
