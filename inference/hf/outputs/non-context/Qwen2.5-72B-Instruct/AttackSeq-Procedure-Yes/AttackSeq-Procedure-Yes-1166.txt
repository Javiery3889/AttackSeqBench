### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an actor named Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to infect the target with Plexor malware.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the tools used by Longhorn will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document. This is a common initial access technique (T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution).
   - **Infection with Plexor Malware:**
     - Plexor malware is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including persistence and data exfiltration.
   - **Avoiding Detection:**
     - The Vault 7 documents, leaked from the CIA, contain detailed information on various techniques and tools used to avoid detection, such as using anti-forensic techniques, obfuscation, and stealthy communication methods.
   - **System Fingerprinting for Discovery:**
     - After gaining access, the next logical step in an attack sequence is to perform detailed system fingerprinting to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation (T1082: System Information Discovery, T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of Following Vault 7 Guidelines:**
     - Given that Longhorn is using a zero-day vulnerability and sophisticated malware like Plexor, it is likely that the tools and techniques used are advanced and designed to avoid detection.
     - The Vault 7 documents are a valuable resource for advanced attackers, and it is plausible that a sophisticated actor like Longhorn would incorporate these guidelines into their toolkit to maintain stealth.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (initial access, avoiding detection, and then system fingerprinting) is a logical and common sequence in advanced cyber attacks.

### Final Answer:
