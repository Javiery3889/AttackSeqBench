### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by cybercriminals.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses by reinstalling malware on internal sites using infrastructure software.
     - Gaining system administrators' credentials during the discovery phase.
     - Using remote administration tools to explore financial systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses by Reinstalling Malware:**
     - This is a common technique used to maintain persistence and re-establish control over a compromised system. It aligns with the initial stages of an attack, often part of the "Persistence" and "Defense Evasion" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Gaining System Administrators' Credentials:**
     - This is a critical step in the attack sequence, typically part of the "Credential Access" and "Discovery" tactics. Once attackers have administrative credentials, they can gain deeper access to the network and systems.
   - **Using Remote Administration Tools:**
     - After gaining administrative credentials, it is highly likely that attackers will use remote administration tools (RATs) to explore and control the network. This aligns with the "Command and Control" and "Execution" tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exploring Financial Systems:**
     - Once the attackers have control and access to the network, they are likely to target financial systems to achieve their objectives, such as stealing financial data or conducting financial fraud. This aligns with the "Collection" and "Exfiltration" tactics.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that cybercriminals will use remote administration tools to explore financial systems after gaining system administrators' credentials during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
