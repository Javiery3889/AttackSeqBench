### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Suckfly using a signed credential-dumping tool during the Credential Access phase and then scanning the corporate internal network for specific ports during the Discovery phase.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Credential Access**: Using a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain account credentials.
     - **Discovery**: Scanning the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900, and 40 open.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: Suckfly is known to use various techniques to gain access to credentials. Using a signed credential-dumping tool is a plausible method, as it can help evade detection by security software that might flag unsigned tools.
   - **Discovery**: Scanning for open ports is a common technique used during the Discovery phase to identify potential targets and services. Ports 8080, 5900, and 40 are often associated with web services, remote desktop protocols, and other network services, which are valuable targets for attackers.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access**: Suckfly, like many advanced threat actors, would likely use sophisticated tools to avoid detection. A signed credential-dumping tool fits this profile, as it can help the attacker obtain credentials without raising immediate alarms.
   - **Discovery**: After obtaining credentials, the next logical step is to explore the network to identify potential targets. Scanning for open ports is a standard technique for this purpose. The specific ports mentioned (8080, 5900, and 40) are commonly used for web services, remote access, and other network services, making them relevant targets for an attacker.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility of both TTPs and their logical sequence in an attack, the most likely answer is that Suckfly will use a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain credentials and then scan the network for the specified ports.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
