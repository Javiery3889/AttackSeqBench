### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing persistence through account manipulation.
     - Creating scheduled tasks.
   - The question then asks if Earth Lusca is likely to use application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for command and control (C2) to mimic normal traffic and evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Account manipulation and creation of scheduled tasks are common techniques used to maintain long-term access to a compromised system. These techniques are part of the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Once persistence is established, the next logical step for an attacker is to maintain control over the compromised system. This is typically done through C2 channels.
   - **Application Layer Protocols and Data Obfuscation:**
     - To evade detection, attackers often use application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to blend in with normal network traffic. Data obfuscation techniques (e.g., encoding, encryption) are also used to hide the true nature of the C2 traffic.
   - **Earth Lusca's Behavior:**
     - Earth Lusca is known to be a sophisticated threat actor group. Sophisticated groups often use advanced techniques to avoid detection, including the use of application layer protocols and data obfuscation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Earth Lusca and the common use of application layer protocols and data obfuscation in C2 operations, it is highly likely that Earth Lusca would leverage these techniques to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
