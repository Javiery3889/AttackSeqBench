### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker named Sayad.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Modifying the registry to run at startup using `rundll32.exe` for persistence.
     - Collecting system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies.
     - Uploading the encrypted collected data to a malicious web server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Modifying the Registry):**
     - Modifying the registry to run at startup using `rundll32.exe` is a common technique for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Collecting system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies is a typical next step after gaining persistence. This information is valuable for the attacker to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Uploading the collected data to a malicious web server is a common final step in the initial stages of an attack. Encrypting the data before exfiltration is a common practice to avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that Sayad will follow this sequence. The steps are consistent with common attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
