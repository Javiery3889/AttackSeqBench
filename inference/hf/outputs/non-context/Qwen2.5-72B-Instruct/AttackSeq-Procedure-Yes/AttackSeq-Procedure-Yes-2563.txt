### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has gathered information about the infected host, including details like the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.
   - The question then asks whether the Shellbot is likely to establish C&C (Command and Control) communication using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **IRC Channels for C&C:**
     - IRC channels have historically been used by botnets for C&C communication. However, they are less common in modern botnets due to their detectability and the availability of more sophisticated and stealthy communication methods.
   - **Shellbot Characteristics:**
     - Shellbot is a type of malware that often uses more modern and less detectable methods for C&C communication. It is designed to be stealthy and resilient against detection and mitigation.
   - **Gathering Host Information:**
     - The fact that the Shellbot is gathering detailed information about the host suggests that it is likely to use this information to choose a more sophisticated and less detectable method of communication. For example, it might use HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS for C&C communication, which are more common and harder to detect than IRC.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the modern characteristics of Shellbot and the detailed information it gathers about the host, it is less likely to use an IRC channel for C&C communication. More sophisticated and stealthy methods are preferred in modern malware.

**Final Answer: B: No**
