### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Taidoor malware.
   - The Taidoor malware avoids detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control (C2) servers `roudan.serveftp.com` and `mac.gov.hpc.tw`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Taidoor Malware:**
     - Taidoor is a known piece of malware that has been used in various cyber espionage campaigns.
     - It often uses sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, such as encryption and obfuscation.
   - **Downloader and Decryption:**
     - The use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware is a common technique to evade detection by security software.
     - This suggests that the malware is designed to be stealthy and adaptive.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Servers:**
     - Malware typically communicates with C2 servers to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or update itself.
     - The specific C2 servers mentioned (`roudan.serveftp.com` and `mac.gov.hpc.tw`) are part of the attack sequence described.
   - **Likelihood of Communication:**
     - Given that the malware has successfully avoided detection and is now in a decrypted, operational state, it is highly likely that it will attempt to communicate with its C2 servers to carry out its intended tasks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the new Taidoor variant will indeed communicate with the specified C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
