### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence starts with spear-phishing campaigns to harvest credentials during the Credential Access phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT28 will use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into the victim networks in the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaigns (Credential Access):**
     - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing to gain initial access to victim networks. This is a common tactic for harvesting credentials.
   - **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:**
     - APT28 often uses known vulnerabilities to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network. However, the question specifies that this exploitation happens after the credential harvesting.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a tactic used to move deeper into the victim network after gaining initial access. This can be done using various techniques, including the use of harvested credentials.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials, which is a common initial access technique.
   - **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:**
     - While APT28 does exploit known vulnerabilities, it is more common for them to use these vulnerabilities during the initial access phase or during lateral movement, not necessarily as a step between credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After harvesting credentials, APT28 is more likely to use these credentials to move laterally within the network rather than exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The most plausible sequence is that APT28 will use the harvested credentials directly for lateral movement rather than exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers before moving deeper into the victim network.
