### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves the use of the 'Recon' module group, followed by the 'Password' module group, and then the 'Spreading' module group.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Recon Module Group:** This is used to gather initial system information and determine subsequent actions.
   - **Password Module Group:** This is used to steal credentials from various applications and resources.
   - **Spreading Module Group:** This is used to infect other hosts on the network, potentially using vulnerabilities like MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Recon Module Group:** This is a logical first step in any attack. Reconnaissance helps the attacker understand the target environment and identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.
   - **Password Module Group:** After gathering initial information, it is common for attackers to attempt to steal credentials. This can provide them with the necessary access to move laterally within the network.
   - **Spreading Module Group:** Once the attacker has stolen credentials, they can use these to spread to other hosts. This can be done through various methods, including exploiting vulnerabilities like MS08-067 or using stolen admin credentials.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is plausible.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is not plausible.

5. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance** to gather initial information.
     2. **Credential Theft** to obtain necessary access.
     3. **Lateral Movement** to spread to other hosts.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical TTPs used in cyber attacks, as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
