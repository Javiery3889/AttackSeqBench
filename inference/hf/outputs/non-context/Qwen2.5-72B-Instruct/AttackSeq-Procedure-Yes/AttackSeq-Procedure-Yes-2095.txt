### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gaining access through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
     2. **Exploitation:** Using the remote template technique in the DOCX documents.
     3. **Exploitation:** Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool.
     4. **Persistence:** Creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents are a common initial access technique (T1566.001 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
     - The remote template technique (T1204.002) is a method where the document fetches a malicious template from a remote server, which can be used to execute code.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802, etc.) is a known technique used by attackers to gain code execution.
     - The RoyalRoad tool is a malware loader that has been used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task (T1053) is a common persistence technique. Naming it 'Windows Update' is a form of masquerading (T1036) to avoid detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - Spear-phishing with malicious documents is a common initial access method.
   - The remote template technique is a known method to execute code from a malicious document.
   - Exploiting Equation Editor vulnerabilities using the RoyalRoad tool is a well-documented technique used in multi-stage infection chains.
   - Creating a scheduled task for persistence is a standard technique to ensure the malware remains on the system.
