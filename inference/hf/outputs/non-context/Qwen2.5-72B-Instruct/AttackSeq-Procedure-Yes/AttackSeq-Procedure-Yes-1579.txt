### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PowerStallion is used to monitor antimalware logs and the Windows process list for discovery purposes.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will utilize Microsoft OneDrive as its command and control (C2) infrastructure for exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerStallion for Discovery:**
     - PowerStallion is a tool that can be used for reconnaissance and discovery. It can monitor antimalware logs and the Windows process list to gather information about the environment, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Microsoft OneDrive for C2:**
     - Microsoft OneDrive is a cloud storage service that can be used for various purposes, including data exfiltration and C2 communication. However, using a legitimate service like OneDrive for C2 is a known technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" tactic, specifically the "Web Protocols" and "Web Services" sub-techniques.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after gathering information about the environment, an attacker might choose to use a legitimate service like OneDrive for C2 and exfiltration. This is because:
       - OneDrive is a trusted service, which can help the attacker evade detection.
       - OneDrive is often allowed through network firewalls and security policies, making it a useful channel for C2 and exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility and the known use of legitimate services for C2 and exfiltration, the most likely answer is that the malware will utilize Microsoft OneDrive for C2 and exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
