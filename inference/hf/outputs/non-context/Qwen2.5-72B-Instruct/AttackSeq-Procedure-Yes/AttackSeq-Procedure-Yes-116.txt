### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells.
     - Using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be used to exfiltrate data to C2 (Command and Control) servers as part of its execution functionality.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting Public-Facing Applications:**
     - This is a common initial access technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to gain a foothold in the network.
   - **Uploading Webshells:**
     - Webshells are scripts that provide a web-based interface for attackers to execute commands on the compromised server.
   - **Using RDP for Lateral Movement:**
     - RDP is often used to move laterally within a network, allowing attackers to access other systems and escalate privileges.
   - **Backdoor 'IPsec Helper':**
     - 'IPsec Helper' is a specific backdoor that has been known to be used in various cyber attacks. It is typically used to maintain persistence and facilitate communication with C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration to C2 Servers:**
     - Data exfiltration is a common final stage in many cyber attacks, where sensitive data is sent to attacker-controlled servers.

3. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that after gaining initial access and moving laterally, the attacker would use a backdoor like 'IPsec Helper' to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
   - 'IPsec Helper' is known for its capabilities in maintaining communication with C2 servers, which aligns with the need to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
