### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors use AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate programs.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that these threat actors will bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - AtomBombing is a sophisticated code injection technique that leverages the Windows operating system's mechanisms to execute malicious code. This technique is designed to evade detection by traditional security solutions.
     - By injecting code into legitimate processes, threat actors can hide their malicious activities, making it difficult for AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions to detect the malicious code.
     - This technique is known for its ability to bypass security solutions, as it does not rely on traditional file-based or memory-based detection methods.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that threat actors using AtomBombing would not be able to bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
     - However, this is less likely because AtomBombing is specifically designed to evade detection by these security solutions. The technique's ability to inject code into legitimate processes and execute it without creating suspicious files or memory patterns makes it a powerful tool for defense evasion.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is that threat actors using AtomBombing are likely to bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
