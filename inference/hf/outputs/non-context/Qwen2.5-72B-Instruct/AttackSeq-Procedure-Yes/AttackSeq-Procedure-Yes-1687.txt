### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Injecting decrypted shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading.
     - The question asks if APT10 is likely to use the Run registry key for persistence after this sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL Side-Loading is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, causing the legitimate application to load and execute the malicious code.
     - This technique is often used to achieve code execution and maintain stealth.
   - **Run Registry Key:**
     - The Run registry key is a common method for achieving persistence. It allows an attacker to ensure that their malicious code runs every time the system starts.
   - **APT10 TTPs:**
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of persistence techniques, including the Run registry key, to maintain access to compromised systems.
     - They often use multiple layers of persistence to ensure they can regain access even if one method is detected and mitigated.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that APT10 is known to use the Run registry key for persistence, it is highly likely that they would use this method after successfully injecting shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading.
   - The Run registry key is a simple and effective way to ensure that the malicious code runs at system startup, which aligns with APT10's goal of maintaining long-term access to the compromised system.
