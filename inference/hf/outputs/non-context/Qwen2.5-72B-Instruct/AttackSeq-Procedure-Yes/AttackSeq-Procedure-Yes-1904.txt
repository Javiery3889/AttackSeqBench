### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lampion trojan.
   - The trojan achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file and a new VBS file to ensure execution at system startup.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server to send collected data using an application layer protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The trojan creates a .lnk file and a VBS file to ensure it runs at system startup. This is a common technique for achieving persistence, allowing the malware to maintain a foothold on the system.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once a trojan has established persistence, it is highly likely that it will attempt to communicate with a C2 server. This communication is essential for the malware to receive commands, exfiltrate data, and maintain control over the infected system.
   - **Application Layer Protocol:**
     - Malware often uses application layer protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS) to communicate with C2 servers because these protocols are commonly allowed through firewalls and are less likely to be blocked by network security measures.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the persistence mechanism described and the typical behavior of trojans, it is highly likely that the Lampion trojan will communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol to send collected data and receive commands.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
