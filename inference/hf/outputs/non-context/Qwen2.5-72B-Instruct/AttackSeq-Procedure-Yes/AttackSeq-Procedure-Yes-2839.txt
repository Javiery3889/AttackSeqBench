### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses through a dropper.
     - Persisting in the system by setting a registry key with the `upnphost.exe` executable.
     - Gathering system information.
     - Sending the gathered information to a server located in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses through a Dropper:**
     - APT28 is known for using sophisticated droppers to evade detection. This is a common initial step in their attack lifecycle.
   - **Persisting in the System:**
     - Setting a registry key to ensure persistence is a well-documented technique used by APT28. Using `upnphost.exe` as a persistence mechanism is plausible, as it is a legitimate Windows executable that can be abused for this purpose.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Once persistence is established, APT28 typically gathers system information to understand the environment they are operating in. This is part of the Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Sending Information to a Server in Hong Kong:**
     - APT28 is known to use various command and control (C2) servers located in different regions, including Hong Kong. This is a plausible step for exfiltrating the gathered information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that APT28 would gather system information and send it to a server located in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
