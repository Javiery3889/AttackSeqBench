### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Regin malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing a multistage payload to inject files into `services.exe`.
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Employing remote access Trojan (RAT) capabilities to capture screenshots and crawl through the file system for data collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization before using its RAT capabilities.
     - This aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like Regin. After gaining a foothold in the system (by injecting files into `services.exe`), it is common for such malware to gather information about the system's processes and memory to understand the environment and avoid detection.
     - Once it has this information, it can then proceed to use its RAT capabilities to perform more advanced actions like capturing screenshots and collecting data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Regin is not likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization before using its RAT capabilities.
     - This is less plausible because gathering system information is a crucial step for sophisticated malware to ensure it can operate effectively and avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like Regin, it is more likely that it would gather information on processes and memory utilization before employing its RAT capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
