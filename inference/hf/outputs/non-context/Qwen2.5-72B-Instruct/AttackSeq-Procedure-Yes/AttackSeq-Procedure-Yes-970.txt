### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Naikon APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses by operating C&C servers in limited time windows.
     - Utilizing fileless loading techniques.
     - Using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase.
     - Communicating with the C&C server using HTTP and TCP protocols.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - Operating C&C servers in limited time windows is a common technique to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
     - Fileless loading techniques involve executing malware in memory without writing to the disk, which helps evade signature-based detection.

   - **Using Aria-body Backdoor:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor is known to be used by the Naikon APT group for various purposes, including gathering information about active processes.
     - This aligns with the discovery phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where the attacker gathers information about the target system.

   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - Using HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication is a common practice in many APT groups, including Naikon.
     - This aligns with the command and control phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of the Naikon APT group.
   - Each step in the sequence (evading defenses, using Aria-body backdoor, and communicating with C&C server) is plausible and aligns with the group's known behavior.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
