### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the RevengeHotels campaign has already captured credentials from compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware used in this campaign will monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Monitoring documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data is a specific technique that can be used to gather sensitive information. However, this technique is more commonly associated with point-of-sale (PoS) malware or malware targeting financial institutions.
     - The question mentions that the malware has already captured credentials from hotel systems and online travel agencies, which suggests that the primary goal is to steal login credentials and sell them to other cybercriminals.
     - While monitoring printer documents could be a secondary objective, it is not a typical or primary behavior for malware focused on credential theft in the context of hotel systems and online travel agencies.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - Given that the primary objective of the malware in the RevengeHotels campaign is to capture credentials and sell them, it is less likely that the malware would also monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.
     - The focus on credential theft aligns more with the typical behavior of malware targeting hotel systems and online travel agencies, where the main goal is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign is unlikely to monitor documents sent to the printer to collect credit card data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
