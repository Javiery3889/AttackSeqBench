### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Stealing clipboard contents.
     - Copying files from local systems and removable media.
     - Staging the stolen data in a temporary folder.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C2) servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Standard FTP and HTTP Ports:**
     - FTP typically uses port 21, and HTTP typically uses port 80.
     - These ports are commonly used and often monitored by network security systems.
   - **Fallback Channels:**
     - Fallback channels are alternative communication methods used when the primary method is blocked or detected.
     - Malware often uses fallback channels to maintain communication with C2 servers in case the primary method is disrupted.
   - **Likelihood of Using Standard Ports First:**
     - Malware often starts with standard ports because they are widely used and less likely to raise immediate suspicion.
     - However, if these ports are detected and blocked, the malware will switch to fallback channels to maintain communication.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that standard FTP and HTTP ports are commonly used and less likely to raise immediate suspicion, it is plausible that Machete would use these ports first.
   - If these ports are detected and blocked, the malware would then switch to fallback channels to maintain communication with the C2 servers.
   - This approach is a common strategy in malware to ensure persistent and reliable communication.
