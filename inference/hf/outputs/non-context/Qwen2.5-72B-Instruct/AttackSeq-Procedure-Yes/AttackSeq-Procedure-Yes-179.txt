### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The initial activities include discovery actions such as enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning.
   - The question then asks if the attacker, specifically "Infamous Chisel," is likely to leverage Command and Control (C2) capabilities like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning are typical discovery techniques used to gather information about the target environment. These activities help the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Capabilities:**
     - SCP, Socks, and SSH are common tools used for maintaining control over a compromised system and exfiltrating data.
     - SCP is used for secure file transfer.
     - A Socks connection can be used to route traffic through the compromised system, allowing the attacker to access other parts of the network.
     - SSH can be used for remote command execution and maintaining a persistent connection to the compromised system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After performing discovery activities, an attacker would typically look to establish and maintain control over the compromised system. This is where C2 capabilities come into play.
   - The use of SCP, Socks, and SSH aligns well with the next logical steps in an attack sequence:
     - **SCP** for transferring files (e.g., exfiltrating sensitive data).
     - **Socks** for routing traffic and accessing other network segments.
     - **SSH** for maintaining a persistent and secure connection to the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that "Infamous Chisel" would leverage these C2 capabilities to further their attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
