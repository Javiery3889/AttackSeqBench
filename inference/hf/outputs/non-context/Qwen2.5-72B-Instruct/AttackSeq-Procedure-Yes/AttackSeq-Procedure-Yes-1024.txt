### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
     - Using these documents for lateral movement via compromised systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will indeed search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.
     - This is a common tactic in cyber attacks, especially for advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Gamaredon. After gaining access to a system and moving laterally, the next logical step is to collect sensitive information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.
     - This is less likely, as the primary goal of many APT groups, including Gamaredon, is to exfiltrate sensitive data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1: Understanding Gamaredon's Motivations**
     - Gamaredon is known for targeting government and military organizations, often with the goal of stealing sensitive information.
   - **Step 2: Analyzing the Sequence of TTPs**
     - Injecting malicious macros into documents is a common initial access technique.
     - Lateral movement via compromised systems is a subsequent step to expand the attacker's presence within the network.
   - **Step 3: Collection Phase**
     - After gaining access and moving laterally, the next logical step is to search for and collect sensitive documents.
   - **Step 4: Conclusion**
     - Given the known tactics of Gamaredon and the typical sequence of TTPs in cyber attacks, it is highly likely that the malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
