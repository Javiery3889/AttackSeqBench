### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already maintained persistence using methods like registry keys and VBScripts for MargulasRAT.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that SideCopy will employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Keys and VBScripts for Persistence:**
     - These are common techniques used by malware to ensure that it runs every time the system starts or at regular intervals. This is a typical initial step in maintaining a foothold in the target system.
   - **SideCopy:**
     - SideCopy is a known malware that has been associated with sophisticated attack campaigns. It often uses advanced techniques to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Mimicking legitimate processes and using decoy documents are common evasion techniques used by advanced malware to avoid detection by security software and analysts.
     - Mimicking legitimate processes (e.g., process injection, process hollowing) can make the malware appear as a benign or trusted process.
     - Using decoy documents can help in social engineering attacks, where the malware is disguised as a legitimate document to trick users into executing it.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that SideCopy is known for its sophisticated nature, it is highly likely that it would employ advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - The use of registry keys and VBScripts for persistence suggests that the attacker is already taking steps to ensure the malware remains on the system. It is logical to assume that they would also take steps to avoid detection, which includes mimicking legitimate processes and using decoy documents.

### Final Answer:
