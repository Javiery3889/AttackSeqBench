### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the question asks if it is likely that the attackers will map the network and collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges before using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spearphishing with malicious attachments is a common initial access technique (T1566.002 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Network Mapping:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often map the network to understand the environment and identify potential targets (T1018 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges is a crucial step in escalating privileges (T1003, T1005, T1056 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement is a common technique after gaining the necessary credentials (T1021.002, T1021.004 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain access through spearphishing.
     2. **Network Mapping:** Understand the network topology.
     3. **Credential Access:** Collect necessary credentials to escalate privileges.
     4. **Lateral Movement:** Use the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network.
   - This sequence is highly plausible and aligns with typical attacker behavior as documented in various CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
