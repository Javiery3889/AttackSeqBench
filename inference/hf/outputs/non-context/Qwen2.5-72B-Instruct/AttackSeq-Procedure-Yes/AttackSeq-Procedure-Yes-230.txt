### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor in memory.
     - The purpose of this is for defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if the backdoors are likely to connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Loader DLL and Encrypted Backdoor:**
     - Using a loader DLL to decrypt and execute an encrypted backdoor is a common technique for evading detection by security software. This is often part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Connection to C2 Servers:**
     - Once a backdoor is executed, it is highly likely that it will attempt to communicate with a C2 server. This is a fundamental step in maintaining control over the compromised system and executing further commands.
     - The C2 communication is part of the "Command and Control" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Lazarus Group's Behavior:**
     - The Lazarus group is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks. They often use encrypted backdoors and C2 communication to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the described sequence of TTPs and the known behavior of the Lazarus group, it is highly likely that the backdoors will connect to C2 servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
