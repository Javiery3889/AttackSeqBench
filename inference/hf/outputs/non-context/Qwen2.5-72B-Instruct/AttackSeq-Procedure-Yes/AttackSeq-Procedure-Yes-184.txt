### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor "Infamous Chisel."
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Persisting by replacing the legitimate `netd` system binary at the path `/system/bin/netd`.
     2. Performing file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories.
     3. Collecting files from local systems and application directories containing communication data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after persisting by replacing the `netd` binary, Infamous Chisel is likely to perform file and directory discovery and collect files from local systems and application directories containing communication data.
     - This sequence aligns with common post-persistence activities in cyber attacks. After gaining persistence, attackers often perform reconnaissance to understand the environment and identify valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Infamous Chisel is not likely to perform file and directory discovery and collect files from local systems and application directories containing communication data after persisting.
     - This sequence is less plausible because it implies that the attacker would not follow up on the persistence with further actions to achieve their objectives, which is uncommon in sophisticated attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Infamous Chisel would perform file and directory discovery and collect files after persisting by replacing the `netd` binary.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
