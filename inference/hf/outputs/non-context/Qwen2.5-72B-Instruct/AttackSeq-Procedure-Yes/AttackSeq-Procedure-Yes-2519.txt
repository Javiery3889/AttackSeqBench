### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the BlueDelta campaign.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Exploiting the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access.
     2. Conducting discovery activities to gather information such as system and network configurations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - CVE-2020-35730 is a known vulnerability in Roundcube webmail software.
       - Exploiting this vulnerability for initial access is a common tactic in cyber attacks.
       - After gaining initial access, conducting discovery activities to gather system and network configurations is a logical next step to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - If this choice were correct, it would imply that either the vulnerability was not exploited for initial access, or the discovery activities were not conducted, or both.
       - However, the sequence described aligns well with typical attack patterns where initial access is followed by reconnaissance.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** CVE-2020-35730 is a known vulnerability in Roundcube webmail software, making it a plausible target for initial access.
   - **Step 2:** Exploiting this vulnerability to gain initial access is a common tactic in cyber attacks.
   - **Step 3:** Conducting discovery activities to gather system and network configurations is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Step 4:** The sequence described in the question aligns with typical attack patterns and is therefore likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
