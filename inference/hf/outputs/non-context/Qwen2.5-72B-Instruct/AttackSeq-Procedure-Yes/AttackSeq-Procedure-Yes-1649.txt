### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack that initially leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Unpatched Vulnerability:**
     - The attack started with an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8. This suggests that the attackers had a way to exploit a known vulnerability to gain initial access to the victim's network.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The reconnaissance phase is typically the early stage of an attack where attackers gather information about the target. This can include identifying vulnerabilities, mapping the network, and gathering credentials.
   - **Phishing Domains:**
     - Phishing domains are often used to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as credentials. This is a common technique in the reconnaissance phase to gather user credentials.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While the initial access was gained through an unpatched vulnerability, it is entirely plausible that the attackers also used phishing domains to gather additional user credentials. This would help them maintain persistence and move laterally within the network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common use of phishing domains in the reconnaissance phase to gather credentials, and the fact that the attackers had already demonstrated a sophisticated approach by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability, it is likely that they also used phishing domains to gather user credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
