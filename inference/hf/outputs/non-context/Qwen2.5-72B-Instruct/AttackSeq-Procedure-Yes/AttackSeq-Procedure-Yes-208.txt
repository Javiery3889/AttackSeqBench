### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence starts with the Discovery phase, where system information such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes are collected.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase is crucial for understanding the environment and identifying valuable targets. Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes is a common technique used to gather intelligence about the compromised system.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - After discovering the valuable information, the next logical step is to collect the actual data. Reading file contents is a typical technique used in the Collection phase to gather the data that the attacker is interested in.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Once the data is collected, the attacker will exfiltrate it to their C&C server. This is a common final step in many attack sequences.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the logical progression from Discovery to Collection to Exfiltration, it is highly likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating the data.
   - Reading file contents is a necessary step to ensure that the data being exfiltrated is the desired data.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
