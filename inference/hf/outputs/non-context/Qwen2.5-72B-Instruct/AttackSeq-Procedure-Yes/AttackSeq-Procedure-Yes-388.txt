### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Vyveva backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Collection Phase:** Compressing files with zlib for exfiltration.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** Encrypting C2 traffic using the XOR operation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Compressing files with zlib is a common technique used to reduce the size of data before exfiltration, making it more efficient to transfer.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - Encrypting C2 traffic is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the communication between the malware and the attacker's server.
     - The XOR operation is a simple and lightweight encryption method that can be used to obfuscate data. It is often used in malware to avoid more complex and resource-intensive encryption algorithms.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given that the backdoor is already using zlib for compression, it is plausible that it would also use a simple encryption method like XOR to encrypt C2 traffic. This is because:
     - XOR is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement.
     - It provides a basic level of obfuscation that can help evade simple network monitoring tools.
     - Many malware authors use a combination of compression and simple encryption to balance efficiency and stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the above reasoning, it is likely that the Vyveva backdoor would encrypt C2 traffic using the XOR operation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
