### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a hypothetical malware called "Smooth Operator."
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file during the discovery stage.
     2. Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json` during the collection stage.
     3. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Stage:**
     - Collecting the OS version from `SystemVersion.plist` is a common technique used during the discovery stage to gather information about the victim's system.
   - **Collection Stage:**
     - Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from `3CX` file `config.json` is a plausible step in the collection stage. This information can be valuable for further attacks or exfiltration.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers is a common technique used to send collected data back to the attacker and receive further instructions.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a typical attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery:** Gather basic system information.
     2. **Collection:** Extract specific, valuable data.
     3. **C2 Communication:** Send the collected data to the attacker.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
