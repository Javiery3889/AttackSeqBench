### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN8.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using `wmic.exe` to create a process on the Domain Controller for lateral movement.
     2. Conducting system fingerprinting using commands like `systeminfo.exe` and `net.exe`.
     3. Determining the system network configuration using tools such as `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Using `wmic.exe` for Lateral Movement:**
     - `wmic.exe` (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) is a powerful tool that can be used to execute commands on remote systems, making it a common choice for lateral movement.
     - This aligns with the initial step in the sequence.

   - **Step 2: Conducting System Fingerprinting:**
     - System fingerprinting is a crucial step in post-exploitation to gather information about the target system, such as OS version, installed software, and user accounts.
     - Commands like `systeminfo.exe` and `net.exe` are commonly used for this purpose.
     - This step is logical and often follows successful lateral movement.

   - **Step 3: Determining System Network Configuration:**
     - After gathering system information, the next logical step is to understand the network environment.
     - Tools like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` are used to determine IP addresses, network interfaces, and connectivity.
     - This step is also logical and often follows system fingerprinting.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common sequence of actions for a threat actor like FIN8.
   - Lateral movement, followed by system fingerprinting, and then network configuration determination, is a typical attack flow.
