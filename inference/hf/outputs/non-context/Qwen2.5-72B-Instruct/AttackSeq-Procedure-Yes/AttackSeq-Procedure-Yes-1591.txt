### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - The question then asks whether T9000 is likely to capture audio from Skype users as part of its data collection efforts.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that T9000 is likely to capture audio from Skype users.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that T9000 is not likely to capture audio from Skype users.

3. **Context and Analysis:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe are common techniques used to ensure that malware runs persistently on a system. This indicates that the attacker has a high level of control over the system.
   - **T9000 Malware:**
     - T9000 is a sophisticated piece of malware known for its advanced capabilities, including data exfiltration and surveillance. It has been observed to capture various types of data, including audio and video.
   - **Skype Audio Capture:**
     - Capturing audio from Skype users is a specific and targeted data collection effort. Given the sophisticated nature of T9000 and the level of control the attacker has over the system, it is plausible that T9000 would be capable of and likely to capture audio from Skype users.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the sophisticated nature of T9000 and the established persistence mechanisms, it is reasonable to conclude that T9000 would be likely to capture audio from Skype users as part of its data collection efforts.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
