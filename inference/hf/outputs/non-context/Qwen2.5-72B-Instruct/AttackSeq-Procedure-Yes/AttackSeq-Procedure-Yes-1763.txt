### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker named Sayad.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by modifying the registry to run `DiagnosticsService.dll` at startup using `rundll32.exe`.
     - Using oversimplified obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding.
     - Exporting a managed API through the native Export Address Table for defense evasion.
     - Stealing credentials from applications like FileZilla, WinSCP, and Putty.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Modification:**
     - Modifying the registry to run a DLL at startup using `rundll32.exe` is a common technique for ensuring persistence. This is a well-documented method in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Persistence" tactic.
   - **Oversimplified Obfuscation:**
     - Using Base64 encoding is a basic form of obfuscation. While it can be effective in evading simple detection mechanisms, it is not a sophisticated method and is often used by less advanced attackers or in the early stages of an attack.
   - **Exporting Managed API:**
     - Exporting a managed API through the native Export Address Table (EAT) is a more advanced technique for defense evasion. This involves manipulating the way the operating system loads and uses APIs, which can help in evading detection by security software.
   - **Stealing Credentials:**
     - Stealing credentials from applications like FileZilla, WinSCP, and Putty is a common technique for gaining access to sensitive information and furthering the attack. This is typically done after gaining initial access and ensuring persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. An attacker who has already ensured persistence might use oversimplified obfuscation techniques to avoid immediate detection. However, the use of more advanced techniques like exporting a managed API through the EAT suggests a more sophisticated approach.
   - The combination of basic and advanced techniques is not uncommon in real-world attacks. Attackers often use a mix of techniques to balance the need for stealth and the complexity of the attack.
   - Stealing credentials from applications is a logical next step after ensuring persistence and evading defenses.
