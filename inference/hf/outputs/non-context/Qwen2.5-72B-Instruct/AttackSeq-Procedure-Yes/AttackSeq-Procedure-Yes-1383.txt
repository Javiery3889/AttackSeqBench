### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker is conducting reconnaissance on medical infrastructure.
   - The tools mentioned for reconnaissance are masscan, Shodan, and Censys.
   - The question asks if it is likely that various services on the medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered during network service discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Tools:**
     - **masscan:** A fast port scanner that can quickly identify open ports and services on a network.
     - **Shodan:** A search engine for internet-connected devices and services, often used to find exposed systems and devices.
     - **Censys:** Another search engine for internet-connected devices and services, similar to Shodan, but with a focus on security research.
   - **Network Service Discovery:**
     - These tools are designed to identify and enumerate services running on networked devices.
     - Medical infrastructure often includes a variety of devices, some of which may be outdated or not properly secured.
   - **Likelihood of Discovery:**
     - Given the capabilities of these tools, it is highly likely that they will discover various services on the network perimeters.
     - Outdated systems and medical devices are common in medical infrastructure and are often vulnerable to attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the capabilities of the reconnaissance tools and the common presence of outdated systems and medical devices in medical infrastructure, it is highly likely that these services will be discovered during network service discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
