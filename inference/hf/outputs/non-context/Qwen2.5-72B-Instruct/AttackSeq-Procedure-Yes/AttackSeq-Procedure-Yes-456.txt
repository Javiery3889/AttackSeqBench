### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving a piece of malware called CEIDPageLock.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting victim browsing data.
     - Connecting to C&C (Command and Control) hard-coded domains.
     - Downloading the homepage configuration.
     - Tampering with the browser.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the driver will connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration as part of the process of tampering with the browser.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the driver will not connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration as part of the process of tampering with the browser.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Collecting Victim Browsing Data:**
     - This is a common initial step for malware to gather information about the victim's activities.
   - **Connecting to C&C Hard-Coded Domains:**
     - Malware often communicates with C&C servers to receive further instructions, update configurations, or exfiltrate data.
   - **Downloading the Homepage Configuration:**
     - This could be part of the C&C communication to modify the victim's browser settings, such as changing the homepage to a malicious site.
   - **Tampering with the Browser:**
     - Modifying browser settings, such as the homepage, is a common tactic used by malware to redirect users to malicious sites or to maintain persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described, it is plausible that the driver will connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration as part of the process of tampering with the browser. This aligns with common malware behavior.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
