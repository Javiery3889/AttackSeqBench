### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Palo Alto Networks took control of most C&C (Command and Control) domains used by the Infy malware.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers moved their C&C domains to new IP addresses and released a new version of the malware before the new version began checking for the presence of antivirus products.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Palo Alto Networks took control of the C&C domains, the attackers would likely need to move their C&C infrastructure to new IP addresses to maintain control over the infected systems.
     - Releasing a new version of the malware is a common tactic to evade detection and continue their operations.
     - Checking for the presence of antivirus products is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection and analysis, which is often included in new versions of malware.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not move their C&C domains to new IP addresses or release a new version of the malware.
     - This is less likely because if the C&C domains were taken over, the attackers would lose control over the infected systems, and not taking action would render their efforts ineffective.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of the question, it is highly plausible that the attackers would take steps to regain control and continue their operations. Moving C&C domains to new IP addresses and releasing a new version of the malware are logical and common responses to such a situation.
   - Additionally, including checks for antivirus products in the new version would help the malware avoid detection and analysis, which is a standard practice in malware development.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
