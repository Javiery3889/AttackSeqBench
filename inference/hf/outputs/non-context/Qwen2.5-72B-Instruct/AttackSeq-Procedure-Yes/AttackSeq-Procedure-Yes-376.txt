### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by BBSRAT (a type of malware).
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing command and control (C2) communication through HTTP or HTTPS requests.
     - Exfiltrating data about the victim's machine.
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the malware exfiltrating additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely for BBSRAT to exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.
     - This aligns with common malware behavior, where after initial exfiltration of basic system information, the malware often sends additional data to the C2 server. This data can include sensitive information, files, or other data of interest to the attacker.
     - Compressing and encrypting the data is a common technique to reduce the size of the data being sent and to avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely for BBSRAT to exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.
     - This is less plausible because it contradicts the typical behavior of malware, which often continues to exfiltrate data in a structured and stealthy manner.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BBSRAT would exfiltrate additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
