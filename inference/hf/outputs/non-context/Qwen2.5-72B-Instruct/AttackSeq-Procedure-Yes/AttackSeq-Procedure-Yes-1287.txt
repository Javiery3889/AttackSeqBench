### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where a malicious Microsoft Word document contains encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - These scripts are executed through macro-triggered events.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access method described (embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing them through macro-triggered events) is a common technique used by attackers. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1204.002 (Malicious File) and T1059.001 (PowerShell).
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish persistence to maintain long-term access to the compromised system. Dropping components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence is a plausible next step. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job) or T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Once persistence is established, attackers often employ obfuscation methods to evade detection. This includes encoding or obfuscating the backdoor payload. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information).

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence before employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
