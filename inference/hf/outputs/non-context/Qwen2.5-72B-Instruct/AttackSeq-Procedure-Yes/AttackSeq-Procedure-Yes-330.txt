### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the skip-2.0 backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Achieving persistence through DLL hijacking.
     2. Loading at system startup via the Windows SessionEnv service.
     3. Employing multiple hooks in the sqllang.dll service to bypass authentication and evade defenses.
     4. The Inner-Loader component performing process discovery targeting MSSQL Server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via DLL Hijacking:**
     - DLL hijacking is a common technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL. This can be used to achieve persistence by ensuring the malicious DLL is loaded at system startup.
   - **Loading at System Startup via Windows SessionEnv Service:**
     - The Windows SessionEnv service is a legitimate service that can be exploited to load malicious code at startup. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **Employing Multiple Hooks in sqllang.dll:**
     - Hooking is a technique where an attacker intercepts and modifies function calls. Hooking sqllang.dll, which is a component of MSSQL Server, can be used to bypass authentication and evade defenses. This is a sophisticated and plausible step.
   - **Inner-Loader Component Performing Process Discovery:**
     - The Inner-Loader component is likely a part of the backdoor that performs additional tasks, such as process discovery, to identify and target MSSQL Server processes. This is a logical next step after gaining persistence and bypassing authentication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Persistence via DLL Hijacking:** This is a common and effective method to ensure the backdoor is loaded at system startup.
     2. **Loading via Windows SessionEnv Service:** This is a specific and plausible method to achieve the persistence described in the first step.
     3. **Hooking sqllang.dll:** This is a sophisticated technique that aligns with the goal of bypassing authentication and evading defenses, which is a common objective for backdoors targeting MSSQL Server.
     4. **Process Discovery by Inner-Loader:** This is a logical next step to identify and target specific processes, such as those related to MSSQL Server.
