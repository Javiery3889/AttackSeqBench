### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance to detect compromised Docker APIs before deploying malicious containers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool designed to scan for and exploit misconfigurations in Docker APIs. It can be used to identify exposed Docker APIs and assess their security posture.
     - If attackers have already gained initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports, it is logical that they would use such a tool to further understand the environment and ensure they have the necessary information to deploy malicious containers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that adversaries would not use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance after gaining initial access.
     - However, this seems less plausible because reconnaissance is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle to gather information and plan further actions.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that DOCKERGEDDON is a tool specifically designed to detect and exploit misconfigurations in Docker APIs, it is highly likely that adversaries would use it to gather more information about the compromised environment before deploying malicious containers.
   - This aligns with the typical attack sequence where reconnaissance is a critical step after gaining initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
