### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an actor named Whitefly.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using stolen credentials for lateral movement.
     - Compromising additional machines.
     - Configuring multiple C&C (Command and Control) domains.
     - Using encrypted payloads to communicate with infected computers.
     - Downloading additional tools for command and control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using stolen credentials for lateral movement:**
     - This is a common TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Lateral Movement" tactic. Techniques include using valid accounts and credentials to move through a network.
   - **Compromising additional machines:**
     - This is a natural progression after gaining initial access and using stolen credentials. It aligns with the "Execution" and "Persistence" tactics.
   - **Configuring multiple C&C domains:**
     - This is a common practice to ensure resilience and maintain control over compromised systems. It falls under the "Command and Control" tactic.
   - **Using encrypted payloads to communicate with infected computers:**
     - Encryption is used to evade detection and maintain stealth. This aligns with the "Command and Control" and "Defense Evasion" tactics.
   - **Downloading additional tools for command and control:**
     - This is a common TTP to extend the attacker's capabilities and maintain control. It falls under the "Execution" and "Command and Control" tactics.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - All the TTPs mentioned in the question are plausible and align with known attack sequences and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The sequence described is a logical and common progression for an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor like Whitefly.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
