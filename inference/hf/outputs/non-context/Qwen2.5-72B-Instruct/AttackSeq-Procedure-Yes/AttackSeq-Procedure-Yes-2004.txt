### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the KopiLuwak backdoor.
   - The backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - The question asks whether the backdoor is likely to exfiltrate files to the C2 (Command and Control) server while also being able to download files to the infected machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP POST Requests:**
     - HTTP POST requests are commonly used for data exfiltration and command execution in backdoor communications.
   - **Exfiltration and Downloading:**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data from the infected machine to the C2 server.
     - Downloading involves receiving data from the C2 server to the infected machine.
   - **KopiLuwak Backdoor:**
     - The KopiLuwak backdoor is known for its capability to perform both exfiltration and downloading of files. This is a common feature in many backdoors to maintain persistence and control over the infected machine.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the backdoor is communicating with compromised websites using HTTP POST requests, it is highly likely that it is capable of both exfiltrating data and downloading files.
   - The use of HTTP POST requests suggests that the backdoor is actively communicating with the C2 server, which typically involves both sending and receiving data.
   - The question does not provide any specific limitations or constraints that would prevent the backdoor from performing these actions.

### Final Answer:
