### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the DNSpionage malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Decoding a PE (Portable Executable) file encoded with base64.
     - Executing the decoded PE file as a scheduled task.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will retrieve the username, hostname, and domain information during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Decoding and Execution:**
     - The malware decodes a base64-encoded PE file and executes it as a scheduled task. This is part of the execution phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase involves the malware gathering information about the system and network environment to understand the context in which it is operating.
     - Retrieving the username, hostname, and domain information is a common technique used during the discovery phase to gain insights into the system's identity and network configuration.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the malware has already executed and is running on the system, it is highly likely that it will proceed to the discovery phase to gather information about the environment.
     - Retrieving the username, hostname, and domain information is a standard and logical next step for the malware to understand the system it has compromised.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that the DNSpionage malware will retrieve the username, hostname, and domain information during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
