### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence involves the Collection phase, where the malware uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information.
   - The question then asks if the malware is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Keylogger: Captures keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
     - Screenshotter: Takes screenshots to capture visual information.
     - Clipboard Stealer: Steals data from the clipboard.
     - These tools are commonly used in the Collection phase to gather various types of data from the victim's system.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP: This is a common method for exfiltrating data.
     - Using stored login credentials: Malware often stores credentials to automate the exfiltration process.
     - Contacting live remote sites: This is typical behavior for malware to establish a connection with command and control (C2) servers or other remote sites to exfiltrate data.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is likely to perform the described actions during the Exfiltration phase.
     - Given the common TTPs of malware, especially those that use keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers, it is highly plausible that CosmicDuke would automate the exfiltration process using FTP and stored credentials.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that CosmicDuke is not likely to perform the described actions during the Exfiltration phase.
     - This is less plausible given the typical behavior of malware and the specific tools used in the Collection phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
