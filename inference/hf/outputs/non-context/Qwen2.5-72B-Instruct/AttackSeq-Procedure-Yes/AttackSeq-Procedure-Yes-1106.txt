### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
     2. Leveraging untrusted and faked digital signatures for defense evasion.
     3. Utilizing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disguising Executable Malware Files:**
     - This is a common technique used to trick users into executing malware. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1036 (Masquerading).
   - **Leveraging Untrusted and Faked Digital Signatures:**
     - This is a technique used to bypass security measures that check for valid digital signatures. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls).
   - **Utilizing C2 Infrastructure with Changing and Static IPs on DynDNS:**
     - This is a technique used to maintain communication with the attacker's server and to evade detection. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) and T1071 (Application Layer Protocol).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Compromise:**
        - Disguising malware to trick users into execution.
     2. **Defense Evasion:**
        - Using faked digital signatures to bypass security checks.
     3. **Command and Control:**
        - Setting up C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns. Each step logically follows the previous one, making it a realistic sequence of actions an attacker might take.

### Final Answer:
