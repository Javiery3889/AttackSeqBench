### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access:** A phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro.
     2. **Execution:** The VBA macro executes commands using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
     3. **Persistence:** The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious documents are a common initial access vector (T1566).
     - The use of a VBA macro in a PowerPoint document to execute malicious code is a known technique (T1204.002).
   - **Execution:**
     - Using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper is a common technique (T1218.005).
     - Blogspot URLs are often used by attackers to host malicious content because they are less likely to be blocked by default.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task to execute a command at regular intervals is a common persistence technique (T1053).

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - Each step in the sequence is a well-documented TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
