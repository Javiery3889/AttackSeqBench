### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Resource Development (T1583):** This involves the acquisition of infrastructure, such as domains, servers, and other resources that can be used in the attack.
   - **Supply Chain Compromise (T1195):** This involves compromising a third-party software update mechanism to gain initial access to the target.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - It is common for attackers to engage in Resource Development activities, such as parking domains, before launching a more sophisticated attack like a supply chain compromise. Parking domains allows attackers to have a ready infrastructure that can be used for various stages of the attack, including initial access, command and control, and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that attackers would not park domains before using a compromised software update. However, this is less likely because having pre-acquired infrastructure is a crucial step in many attack sequences, especially for sophisticated attacks like supply chain compromises.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the nature of supply chain attacks, which often require significant planning and resources, it is highly likely that attackers would have already acquired and parked domains as part of their Resource Development efforts. This allows them to have a robust and flexible infrastructure to support their attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
