### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RIG Exploit Kit (EK).
   - The sequence involves using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtaining capabilities.
   - The question asks whether RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RIG Exploit Kit (EK) Overview:**
     - RIG EK is a well-known exploit kit that has been used to deliver various malware payloads.
     - It typically uses malvertising (malicious advertising) to redirect users to its landing page, where it exploits vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins to execute malicious code.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - **Initial Step:** RIG EK uses malvertising to redirect users to a compromised website or an advertising page.
     - **Second Step:** The compromised website or advertising page contains the exploit code.
     - **Third Step:** The exploit code is executed on the victim's machine, leveraging known browser vulnerabilities.
     - **Final Step:** The exploit kit delivers the payload (malware) to the victim's machine.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question asks if RIG EK is likely to use malvertising to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites before the landing page.
   - Based on the known behavior of RIG EK, it is indeed common for it to use malvertising to redirect users to a landing page where the actual exploitation occurs.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical TTPs of RIG EK, where malvertising is used as the initial vector to redirect users to a malicious landing page.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
