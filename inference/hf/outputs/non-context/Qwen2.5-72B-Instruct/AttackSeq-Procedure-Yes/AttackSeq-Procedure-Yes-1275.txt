### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor "Yellow Garuda."
   - The actions include collecting messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the data collected by the 'grabber' tool are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.
     - This is a plausible scenario because:
       - **Exfiltration over the web** is a common method for transferring data from a victim's system to the attacker's infrastructure.
       - **SQLite database and JSON format** are commonly used for storing and transmitting structured data. SQLite is a lightweight database that can be easily managed and transferred, while JSON is a widely used format for data interchange.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the data are not exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It would be unusual for an attacker to collect data without a method to exfiltrate and store it.
       - The use of SQLite and JSON for data storage and transmission is a common practice in cyber operations.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
