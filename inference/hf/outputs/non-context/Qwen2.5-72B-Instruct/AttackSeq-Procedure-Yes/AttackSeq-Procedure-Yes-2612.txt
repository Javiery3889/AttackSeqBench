### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers use mobile applications loaded with spyware to collect sensitive information (contact lists and geo-location) from victims during the Collection phase.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data from the compromised devices over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control (C2) phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase involves gathering data from the victim's device. In this case, the data includes contact lists and geo-location information.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The C2 phase involves the communication between the compromised device and the attacker's infrastructure. This communication is often used to send commands to the compromised device and to exfiltrate data.
   - **Application Layer Protocol:**
     - Application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) are commonly used for data exfiltration because they are often allowed through firewalls and are less likely to be detected by network security systems.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - After collecting the sensitive information, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data to the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Use of Application Layer Protocols:**
     - Using an application layer protocol for data exfiltration is a common and effective method because it can blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The C2 phase is the appropriate phase for this data exfiltration, as it involves the communication between the compromised device and the attacker's infrastructure.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common use of application layer protocols for data exfiltration and the logical sequence of the attack (Collection followed by C2), it is highly likely that the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data over an application layer protocol during the C2 phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
