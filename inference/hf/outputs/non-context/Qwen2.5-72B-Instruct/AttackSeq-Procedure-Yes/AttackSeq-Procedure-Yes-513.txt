### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milum Trojan.
   - The sequence includes achieving persistence through HKCU autorun system registry keys (Run and RunOnce).
   - The question then asks if the Milum Trojan is likely to use JSON configuration data for C2 (Command and Control) communication via an encrypted channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence through HKCU Autorun System Registry Keys:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the user logs in. The HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) registry keys like Run and RunOnce are frequently used for this purpose.
   - **JSON Configuration Data for C2 Communication:**
     - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used in C2 communication because it can efficiently carry structured data.
   - **Encrypted Channel:**
     - Using an encrypted channel for C2 communication is a standard practice in modern malware to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the communication.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Milum Trojan is likely to use JSON configuration data for C2 communication via an encrypted channel.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Milum Trojan is not likely to use JSON configuration data for C2 communication via an encrypted channel.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of modern malware, it is highly plausible that the Milum Trojan would use JSON configuration data for C2 communication. JSON is a common and efficient format for structured data, and using an encrypted channel is a standard practice to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Milum Trojan would use JSON configuration data for C2 communication via an encrypted channel.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
