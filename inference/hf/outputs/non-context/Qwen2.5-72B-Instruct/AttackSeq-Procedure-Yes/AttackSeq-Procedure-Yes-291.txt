### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
   - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the file-stealer module will then iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will indeed iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.
     - This is a common TTP in many malware operations. After stealing initial credentials, malware often looks for additional valuable data by searching for files with specific extensions (e.g., .doc, .pdf, .xls) that may contain sensitive information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the file-stealer module will not perform the described actions.
     - This is less likely because it would be unusual for a backdoor to steal initial credentials and then not attempt to gather additional data, which is a common follow-up action in cyber attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The Dropping Elephant backdoor is known for its multi-stage attack capabilities.
     - After stealing initial credentials, it is logical for the malware to continue its data exfiltration efforts by searching for and collecting additional files.
     - The file-stealer module is a common component in many malware families, designed to gather and exfiltrate a wide range of data.
     - Therefore, it is highly likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.
   - **Final Answer: A: Yes**
