### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the POWERSHOWER malware.
   - It mentions that POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that POWERSHOWER will then communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop to maintain Command and Control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that POWERSHOWER will continue to communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop.
     - This is a common behavior for malware to maintain persistent control over the infected machine.
     - Malware often establishes a persistent connection to the C2 server to receive further commands, exfiltrate data, or perform additional actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that POWERSHOWER will not continue to communicate with the C2 server.
     - This is less likely because maintaining a connection to the C2 server is crucial for the attacker to control the malware and execute further actions.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that POWERSHOWER has already collected system information and sent it to the C2 server, it is highly likely that it will continue to communicate with the C2 server to maintain control.
   - Maintaining a communications loop is a standard practice in malware to ensure the attacker can issue further commands and maintain persistence on the infected machine.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
