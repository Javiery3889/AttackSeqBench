### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the BlackEnergy dropper.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution of the BlackEnergy dropper through a malicious Word document's VBA macro.
     - Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
     - Using the LNK file to execute a command.
     - Connecting to a hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of the BlackEnergy dropper through a malicious Word document's VBA macro:**
     - This is a common initial infection vector for malware. Malicious documents with VBA macros are frequently used to execute droppers or other malware.
   - **Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder:**
     - Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder is a common technique for ensuring that malware runs every time the system starts. This is a form of persistence.
   - **Using the LNK file to execute a command:**
     - The LNK file can be configured to execute a command or script that re-launches the malware, ensuring it remains active.
   - **Connecting to a hardcoded C&C server:**
     - Once the malware is persistent and active, it often attempts to connect to a C&C server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Infection:**
     - The BlackEnergy dropper is executed through a VBA macro in a malicious Word document. This is a plausible and common method for initial infection.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a LNK file in the system startup folder is a well-known technique for ensuring that the malware runs at every system startup. This aligns with the goal of maintaining persistence.
   - **Command Execution:**
     - The LNK file can be configured to execute a command that re-launches the malware, which is a logical step to ensure the malware remains active.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - After ensuring persistence and re-launching, the malware would typically attempt to connect to a C&C server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data. The presence of a hardcoded C&C server address is consistent with this behavior.
