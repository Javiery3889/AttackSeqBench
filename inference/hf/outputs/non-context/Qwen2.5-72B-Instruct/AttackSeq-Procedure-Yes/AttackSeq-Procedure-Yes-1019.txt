### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Gamaredon's malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Searching for sensitive documents across local and network drives.
     - Capturing screenshots every minute during data collection.
     - Using HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C2) communication.
     - Transferring harvested documents to the C2 server for exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communication before transferring harvested documents.
     - This aligns with common TTPs observed in many APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups, including Gamaredon. HTTP and HTTPS are frequently used for C2 communication because they are common protocols that can blend in with normal network traffic, making detection more difficult.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is unlikely that Gamaredon's malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communication.
     - This is less plausible because HTTP and HTTPS are widely used for C2 communication in many APT campaigns due to their ability to evade detection and their prevalence in network traffic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Gamaredon's malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communication before transferring harvested documents to the C2 server for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
