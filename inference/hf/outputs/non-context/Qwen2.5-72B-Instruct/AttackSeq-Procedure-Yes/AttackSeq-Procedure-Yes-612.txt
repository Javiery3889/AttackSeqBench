### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers gain initial access to hosts using tools like Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC.
   - These tools are used to remotely control software and create new local accounts.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware and clear system events to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Advanced IP Scanner is a network scanning tool that can help identify hosts on a network.
     - Radmin and PushVNC are remote access tools that allow attackers to control remote systems.
     - Creating new local accounts is a common technique to establish persistence and maintain access to the compromised system.
   - **Post-Exploitation:**
     - Using a batch file like `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware and clear system events is a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
     - Downloading malware can help the attackers establish a more persistent presence or perform additional malicious activities.
     - Clearing system events (e.g., logs) is a common technique to evade detection and cover their tracks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that attackers would use `AutoExe1.bat` to download malware and clear system events as part of their efforts to evade detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
