### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of other macOS malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) using their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access before CrateDepression drops its Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal'.
   - The mechanisms mentioned are:
     - Binding a shell to a port
     - Spreading through DMGs
     - Exploiting CVE-2020-9934

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CrateDepression and Poseidon Payloads:**
     - CrateDepression is a specific malware that uses a malicious crate (a package in the Rust programming language) to drop its payloads. The initial access vector for CrateDepression is the malicious crate itself.
   - **Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis:**
     - **Alchimist:** Known for using various techniques to gain initial access, including social engineering and exploiting vulnerabilities.
     - **ChromeLoader:** Typically spreads through malicious DMGs (Disk Images) and can also use other methods like phishing.
     - **CloudMensis:** Known for exploiting vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2020-9934, to gain initial access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question is asking if it is likely that these other malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would use their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access before CrateDepression drops its payloads.
   - The initial access vector for CrateDepression is the malicious crate, which is a specific and distinct method.
   - The mechanisms used by Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis are different and are not directly related to the method used by CrateDepression.
   - It is not typical for multiple malware to use their respective initial access methods in a sequence before another malware drops its payload. Each malware typically has its own independent initial access vector.
