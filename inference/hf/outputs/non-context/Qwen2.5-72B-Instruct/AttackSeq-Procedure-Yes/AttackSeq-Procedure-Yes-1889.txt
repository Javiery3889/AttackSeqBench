### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance** using native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery.
     - **Privilege Escalation** using tools such as ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil.
     - **Lateral Movement** using WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - FIN13 is known to use native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather information about the target environment.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Tools like ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are commonly used for privilege escalation. ProcDump can be used to dump memory, Mimikatz for credential theft, and certutil for various purposes including downloading files and executing commands.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a powerful tool for managing and querying system information, and it can be used for lateral movement. Custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE are also known to be used for maintaining access and moving laterally within a network.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     - **Reconnaissance** is typically the first step to understand the target environment.
     - **Privilege Escalation** follows to gain higher-level access, which is necessary for more advanced operations.
     - **Lateral Movement** is the final step to spread the attack and gain access to other systems within the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the known TTPs of FIN13, it is plausible that they would use the tools mentioned for privilege escalation before employing WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
