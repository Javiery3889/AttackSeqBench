### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the threat actors (Moafee and DragonOK) will use custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) during the resource development phase.
   - Finally, it asks if they will use environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access technique used by many threat actors to gain a foothold in a target network.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Custom-built backdoors and RATs are often used by advanced threat actors to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are used to ensure that the payload is executed only in the intended environment, which helps avoid detection and analysis by security researchers or automated systems.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a common and logical progression in a sophisticated cyber attack:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails are used to gain a foothold.
     2. **Resource Development:** Custom-built backdoors and RATs are deployed to maintain control and persistence.
     3. **Evasion Techniques:** Environment-based checks are used to ensure the payload is executed only in the intended environment.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical and common nature of this attack sequence, it is highly plausible that Moafee and DragonOK would follow this sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
