### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access:** Distributing malicious LNK files disguised as Curriculum Vitae and IELTS exam results.
     2. **Execution:** Leveraging 'gosia.exe' to execute multiple commands to bypass detection.
     3. **Persistence:** Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Using LNK files for initial access is a common technique. LNK files (shortcuts) can be crafted to execute malicious code when opened, often disguised as legitimate files.
   - **Execution:**
     - Leveraging 'gosia.exe' to execute multiple commands to bypass detection is plausible. 'gosia.exe' could be a custom or legitimate tool used to run commands in a way that avoids detection by security software.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks are both common persistence techniques.
     - The startup directory ensures that the malware runs every time the system starts.
     - Scheduled tasks can be used to run the malware at regular intervals or under specific conditions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious LNK files are a known method for initial access. They are often used in phishing campaigns to trick users into executing malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - Using a tool like 'gosia.exe' to execute commands and bypass detection is a plausible step. APT groups often use custom or obfuscated tools to avoid detection by security software.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Copying a file to the startup directory and adding a task to scheduled tasks are both effective methods for maintaining persistence. These techniques ensure that the malware remains active on the system even after a reboot or user logout.

### Final Answer
Given the plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
