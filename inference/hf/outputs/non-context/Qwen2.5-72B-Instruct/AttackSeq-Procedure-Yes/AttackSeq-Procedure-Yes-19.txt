### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the malware "Machete" has achieved persistence by creating a task named 'Microsoft_up' and installing itself in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - The question then asks if "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The creation of a task named 'Microsoft_up' and the installation in 'appdata/MicroDes/' are common techniques used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts or at regular intervals.
   - **Machete Malware Capabilities:** "Machete" is known for its capabilities in data exfiltration and espionage. It often includes features such as keylogging and file exfiltration to gather sensitive information.
   - **Keystroke Logging:** Keylogging is a common technique used by malware to capture user input, which can include sensitive information like passwords and personal data.
   - **File Exfiltration:** Copying files to a special USB device is a method of exfiltrating data, which is a common goal for espionage malware like "Machete."

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the capabilities of "Machete" and the described persistence mechanism, it is highly likely that "Machete" would log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
