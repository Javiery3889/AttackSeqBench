### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed the use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 (Command and Control) servers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, leading to a 'total failure' of Next Media's network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the attackers launched DDoS attacks against the specified targets.
     - The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a common technique in malware and C2 communications to obfuscate data and evade detection.
     - DDoS attacks are a well-known tactic used by attackers to overwhelm target networks and cause service disruptions.
     - The mention of 'total failure' of Next Media's network aligns with the potential impact of a successful DDoS attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the attackers launched DDoS attacks against the specified targets.
     - This choice would imply that the observed use of single-byte XOR keys and the C2 servers are not related to DDoS attacks or the failure of Next Media's network.
     - However, the context provided (FireEye's observation and the specific targets) strongly suggests a connection to DDoS attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the alignment of the observed TTPs (use of single-byte XOR keys and C2 servers) with the described attack (DDoS against democracy-promoting websites and the failure of Next Media's network), the most plausible answer is that the attackers did indeed launch DDoS attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
