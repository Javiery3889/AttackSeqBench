### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
1. Using GoLang-based file recon plugins to enumerate files for credential targeting.
2. Deploying malicious payloads via Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
3. Retrieving Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1601-Modify System Image**
  - This technique involves modifying the system image, which is not relevant to the retrieval of authentication databases. It is more about altering the system's boot process or firmware.

- **B: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage. While this could be a method of exfiltration, the question specifically mentions retrieving authentication databases, which is a more general exfiltration technique.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access or credentials. The question already assumes that the attacker has gained access and is now retrieving authentication databases, so this is not the correct choice.

- **D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - This technique involves the automated exfiltration of data from a compromised system. Given that the attacker has already enumerated files and deployed malicious payloads, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate the targeted data (Kavach authentication databases) using automated means.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to enumerate files for credential targeting.
2. The attacker deploys malicious payloads via C2 infrastructure.
3. The attacker retrieves Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

The most plausible technique for retrieving the authentication databases is **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**. This technique aligns with the final step of the attack sequence, where the attacker needs to exfiltrate the data they have targeted.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
