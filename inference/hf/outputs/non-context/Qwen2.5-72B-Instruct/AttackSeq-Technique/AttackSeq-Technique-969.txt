### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Aria-body backdoor has already collected extensive system information such as host-name, username, and system architecture.
- The next step in the sequence involves the collection of file metadata and taking screenshots.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique logically fits between these two stages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves determining the physical or logical location of a system. While this could be useful, it is not typically a necessary step between collecting system information and collecting file metadata or taking screenshots.
- **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves identifying system and domain accounts. This is a logical step after collecting basic system information and before engaging in more detailed data collection, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and potential access points.
- **T1205.001-Port Knocking**: This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port. This is more related to establishing initial access or maintaining persistence and does not fit well between the described stages.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications. While important, it is not a necessary step between collecting system information and collecting file metadata or taking screenshots.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Collection of System Information**: The backdoor has already gathered basic system information such as host-name, username, and system architecture.
2. **Next Logical Step**: The attacker would likely want to understand the environment better, including the accounts and permissions available, to plan further actions.
3. **Account Discovery (T1087)**: This technique fits well as the next step because it helps the attacker identify potential accounts that can be used for further data collection and privilege escalation.
4. **Subsequent Data Collection**: After identifying the accounts, the attacker can then proceed to collect file metadata and take screenshots.

### Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery
