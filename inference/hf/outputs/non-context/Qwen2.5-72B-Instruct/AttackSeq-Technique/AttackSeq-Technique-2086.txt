### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) initiated its Initial Access through a drive-by compromise leveraging malvertising and compromised sites.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates**
  - This technique involves obtaining and using code signing certificates to sign malicious software. While this can be a part of the attack lifecycle, it is not typically a prerequisite for the initial access via a drive-by compromise. It is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase where the attacker might want to make their malware appear more legitimate.

- **B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves the attacker obtaining the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) necessary to conduct the attack. This can include acquiring exploit kits, malware, and other tools. This is a logical step that would occur before the initial access, as the attacker needs to have the necessary tools to carry out the drive-by compromise.

- **C: T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media such as USB drives. This is not relevant to a drive-by compromise, which typically occurs through web-based vectors.

- **D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While this is important for maintaining stealth and evading detection, it is not a prerequisite for the initial access via a drive-by compromise. It is more relevant to the command and control phase of the attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The initial access via a drive-by compromise using the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) requires the attacker to have the necessary tools and capabilities to exploit the target. This includes having the exploit kit itself and any other tools needed to deliver and execute the payload.
  - The technique "T1588 - Obtain Capabilities" aligns best with this requirement, as it involves the attacker acquiring the necessary tools and capabilities before initiating the attack.

**Final Answer: B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities**
