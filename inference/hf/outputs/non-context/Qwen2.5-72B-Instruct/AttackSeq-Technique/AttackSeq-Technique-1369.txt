### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) during the hacking targets phase. The key points are:
- Reusing command and control (C2) infrastructure from other groups.
- Separating spear-phishing infrastructure from malware C2 infrastructure.
- Establishing communication channels to maintain control over the victim environment.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - Traffic Signaling involves using legitimate or compromised third-party services to signal the start of an attack or to coordinate actions. This technique is more about signaling and coordination rather than establishing and maintaining communication channels.

- **B: T1659-Content Injection**
  - Content Injection involves inserting malicious content into legitimate web pages or applications. This technique is more about manipulating content to deceive users or to deliver malware, not about establishing and maintaining communication channels.

- **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - Phishing for Information involves tricking users into providing sensitive information. This technique is more about gathering information rather than establishing and maintaining communication channels.

- **D: T1090-Proxy**
  - Proxy involves using intermediary systems to route traffic, often to hide the true source of the traffic or to bypass security controls. This technique is commonly used to establish and maintain communication channels, especially in the context of C2 infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reusing C2 Infrastructure**: This suggests that the attackers are leveraging existing infrastructure to maintain control over the victim environment.
2. **Separating Spear-Phishing Infrastructure from Malware C2 Infrastructure**: This indicates a clear distinction between the infrastructure used for initial access (spear-phishing) and the infrastructure used for maintaining control (C2).
3. **Establishing Communication Channels**: The need to establish and maintain communication channels aligns with the use of a proxy to route traffic and maintain control over the victim environment.

Given the context of maintaining control over the victim environment and the need to establish communication channels, the most plausible technique is **T1090-Proxy**.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
