### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before a malicious app was distributed via a website disguised as a charity site. The goal is to gain initial access to victims' devices.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**
  - This technique involves searching for websites owned by the victim to gather information. While this can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to distributing a malicious app via a charity site.

- **B: T1583.004-Server**
  - This technique involves setting up a server to host malicious content. While this is a necessary step for distributing a malicious app, it is more about the infrastructure setup rather than the initial access method.

- **C: T1593.003-Code Repositories**
  - This technique involves using code repositories to host or distribute malicious content. This is not typically used for initial access via a charity site.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to trick victims into clicking on a link or downloading a malicious app. Phishing can be used to direct victims to a website disguised as a charity site, where they might download the malicious app.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker might have used various techniques to gather information about the victims, but this is not the focus of the question.
2. **Initial Access**: The question specifically asks about the technique used to gain initial access to victims' devices.
3. **Phishing**: Phishing is a common method to trick victims into visiting a malicious website or downloading a malicious app. In this case, the attacker likely used phishing to direct victims to the charity site where the malicious app was hosted.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
