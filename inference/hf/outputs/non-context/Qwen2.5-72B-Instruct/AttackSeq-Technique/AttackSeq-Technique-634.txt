### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has achieved persistence by saving `msupdateconf.exe` to the Startup folder to maintain a Meterpreter session. The next step in the attack involves the decoded shellcode contacting a C&C server at `https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ` to direct the download of additional shellcode.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves using standard data encoding techniques to obfuscate or encode data. While encoding might be used in the shellcode, the question specifically mentions the shellcode contacting a C&C server, which is more about communication than encoding.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. The question mentions that the shellcode contacted a C&C server using HTTPS, which is an application layer protocol. This aligns well with the described sequence.

- **C: T1588.001-Malware**
  - This technique involves the use of malware, which is a broad category. While the shellcode and additional shellcode being downloaded are forms of malware, the specific action described is the communication with the C&C server, not the malware itself.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. The question does not mention the use of command-line interfaces or scripts in the context of the shellcode contacting the C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the shellcode contacting a C&C server using HTTPS.
- The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it specifically involves using common application layer protocols for communication.
- The other answer choices do not align as closely with the specific action of the shellcode contacting the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
