### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where GreyEnergy operators:
1. Used spearphishing to gain initial access.
2. Compromised public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
3. Deployed modular malware functionalities dependent on specific combinations of modules uploaded to victim systems.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the deployment of modular malware functionalities.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1087.001 - Local Account**
  - This technique involves enumerating local accounts on a system. While this could be useful for gaining further access, it is not directly related to the deployment of modular malware.

- **B: T1587 - Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or modifying tools, malware, or capabilities. This is a preparatory step that would likely occur before deploying modular malware functionalities, as the attackers need to have the malware ready and configured.

- **C: T1585.003 - Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves compromising cloud accounts. While this could be a method for initial access, it is not directly related to the deployment of modular malware.

- **D: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. While this could be a method for initial access, it is not directly related to the deployment of modular malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used spearphishing and compromised public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
2. **Preparation for Deployment**: Before deploying modular malware, the attackers would need to have the malware ready and configured. This involves developing or modifying the malware to ensure it can be deployed effectively.
3. **Deployment**: The modular malware is then deployed, with specific combinations of modules uploaded to the victim systems.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before deploying modular malware functionalities is **T1587 - Develop Capabilities**.

**Final Answer: B: T1587 - Develop Capabilities**
