### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving a malicious shortcut file that, when opened, executes a PowerShell command. This is followed by the Asruex malware communicating with a C&C server over HTTP. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur between these two events.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - Data Encoding involves techniques to encode data to make it less recognizable to defenders. This could be used to obfuscate the communication with the C&C server, but it is not typically a step that occurs immediately after executing a PowerShell command and before communicating with the C&C server.

- **B: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
  - SSH Authorized Keys is a technique used to maintain persistence by adding a public key to the authorized_keys file of a target system. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as it does not fit the context of a PowerShell command execution leading to C&C communication.

- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion techniques are used to detect and avoid analysis environments. This could be a plausible step after executing a PowerShell command, as malware often checks if it is running in a virtualized or sandboxed environment before proceeding with further actions, including C&C communication.

- **D: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - Fallback Channels are used when the primary communication channel is not available. This technique is more relevant to the communication phase with the C&C server, not the initial execution phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Event**: The malicious shortcut file is opened, which triggers the execution of a PowerShell command.
2. **Intermediate Step**: The malware needs to ensure it is not being analyzed in a virtualized or sandboxed environment before communicating with the C&C server.
3. **Final Event**: The Asruex malware communicates with the C&C server over HTTP.

Given this sequence, the most plausible intermediate step is the malware performing virtualization/sandbox evasion to ensure it is not being analyzed before proceeding with C&C communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
