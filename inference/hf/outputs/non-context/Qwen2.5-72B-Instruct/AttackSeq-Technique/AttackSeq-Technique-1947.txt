### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Smooth Operator collected domain and account name values from the 3CX file `config.json` as part of its discovery phase.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and defenses. While this can be a part of an attack, it is not typically a prerequisite for collecting domain and account name values.

- **B: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves the adversary attempting to gather account name and other information. This aligns well with the described action of collecting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.

- **C: T1069.001-Local Groups**
  - This technique involves the adversary enumerating local groups on a system. While this can be part of the discovery phase, it is more specific to group membership and not directly related to collecting domain and account name values.

- **D: T1014-Rootkit**
  - This technique involves the use of rootkits to hide the presence of malware. This is more about maintaining persistence and evading detection, not about collecting account information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1562-Impair Defenses** is not a necessary step before collecting account information.
2. **T1087-Account Discovery** directly involves gathering account name and other information, which aligns with the described action.
3. **T1069.001-Local Groups** is more specific to group membership and not directly related to collecting domain and account name values.
4. **T1014-Rootkit** is about maintaining persistence and evading detection, not about collecting account information.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence is that **T1087-Account Discovery** occurred before Smooth Operator collected domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.

**Final Answer: B: T1087-Account Discovery**
