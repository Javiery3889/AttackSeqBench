### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a known malware, has utilized a keylogger and a screenshotter to gather user activity information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Keylogger and Screenshotter:** These tools are used to collect data from the victim's system, specifically keystrokes and screen captures.
   - The next logical step would be to handle the collected data in some way, such as exfiltrating it, archiving it, or further processing it.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration:**
     - This technique involves automatically sending collected data to an attacker-controlled server.
     - Given that the keylogger and screenshotter have already gathered data, exfiltration is a logical next step.
   - **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL:**
     - This technique involves modifying the behavior of network provider DLLs to manipulate network traffic.
     - This is not directly related to handling the collected data and seems less likely to follow the use of a keylogger and screenshotter.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data:**
     - This technique involves compressing and archiving the collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate.
     - Archiving the data before exfiltration is a common practice, but it is typically a step that occurs before exfiltration.
   - **D: T1115-Clipboard Data:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard.
     - While this could be another method of data collection, it is not a logical next step after using a keylogger and screenshotter.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence would be to first collect the data (using keylogger and screenshotter), then archive it (if necessary), and finally exfiltrate it.
   - However, since the question asks for the next step after data collection, the most immediate and logical next step is exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
