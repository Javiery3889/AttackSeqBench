### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where BlackEnergy initially exploited MS Office documents using CVE-2014-1761 for initial access. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled BlackEnergy to evolve with capabilities such as defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows for further evasion of detection.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Exploiting MS Office documents using CVE-2014-1761.
  - Evasion: Defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. While it is related to initial access, it does not address the specific evasion technique of defeating the signed driver requirement.
- **Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that control the elevation of privileges, such as bypassing User Account Control (UAC) or signing requirements. This is directly relevant to defeating the signed driver requirement, which is a form of elevation control.
- **Answer Choice C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be part of an attack sequence, it does not specifically address the evasion technique of defeating the signed driver requirement.
- **Answer Choice D: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering software installed on a system, which can be useful for reconnaissance but does not directly relate to the evasion technique of defeating the signed driver requirement.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access was achieved through exploiting MS Office documents using CVE-2014-1761.
  - The question specifically asks about the technique that enabled BlackEnergy to defeat the signed driver requirement, which is a form of elevation control.
  - Among the given choices, T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism is the most relevant because it directly addresses the evasion technique of bypassing security mechanisms like the signed driver requirement.
- **Final Answer**: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
