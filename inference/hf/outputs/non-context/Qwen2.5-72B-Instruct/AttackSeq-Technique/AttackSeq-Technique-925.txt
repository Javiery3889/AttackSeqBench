### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions involving an Explosive Trojan:
1. The Explosive Trojan dynamically unloaded the Explosive DLL after the desired action was complete.
2. The Trojan then leveraged keylogging capabilities to obtain administrator passwords.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control (C2). It is not directly related to unloading a DLL or keylogging.

- **B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
  - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to unloading a DLL or keylogging.

- **C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
  - This technique involves loading code into memory without writing it to the disk. While it is related to code execution, it is not typically used to unload a DLL or to set up keylogging.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This could be a plausible step after unloading a DLL to clean up traces and before setting up keylogging to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Unloading the DLL**: The Explosive Trojan dynamically unloads the Explosive DLL after the desired action is complete. This suggests a cleanup or stealth operation.
2. **Keylogging**: The Trojan then sets up keylogging to obtain administrator passwords. This is a data collection technique.
3. **Intermediate Step**: Between unloading the DLL and setting up keylogging, it is logical to assume that the attacker would want to hide any traces of the previous actions to avoid detection.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that fits between unloading the DLL and setting up keylogging is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique helps in cleaning up and hiding any artifacts that could alert the system or the user to the presence of the malware.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
