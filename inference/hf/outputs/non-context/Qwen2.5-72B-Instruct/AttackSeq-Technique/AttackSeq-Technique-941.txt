### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the first stage of Zebrocy components is delivered via spearphishing, and initial access has been achieved.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to enable the operators to issue commands and execute subsequent malware stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial access is achieved via spearphishing.
   - The next step is to enable command execution and further malware deployment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1204.002-Malicious File**
     - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, which is typically part of the initial access phase. Since initial access has already been achieved, this technique is not the next logical step.

   - **B: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary ones fail. While this is a valid technique, it is not typically the immediate next step after achieving initial access and before command execution.

   - **C: T1218.010-Regsvr32**
     - This technique involves using the Regsvr32 utility to execute code. While it can be used for command execution, it is more specific and not as general as the next step in the sequence described.

   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts. This is a logical next step after achieving initial access, as it allows the attackers to issue commands and execute subsequent malware stages.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After achieving initial access via spearphishing, the next logical step is to use a command and scripting interpreter to issue commands and execute further malware stages. This aligns with the description in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
