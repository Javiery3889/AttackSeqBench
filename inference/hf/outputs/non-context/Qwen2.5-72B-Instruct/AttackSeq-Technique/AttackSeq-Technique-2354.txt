### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor BRONZE PRESIDENT. The sequence involves:
1. Using phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files for initial access.
2. Prior to this, the use of PlugX and other tools linked to PRC-based infrastructure development.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves the development of custom tools, capabilities, and infrastructure to support operations. This aligns well with the use of PlugX and other tools linked to PRC-based infrastructure development.

- **B: T1584.007-Serverless**
  - This technique involves the use of serverless computing services to host malicious code or infrastructure. While this could be part of a broader attack, it does not specifically align with the development of custom tools and infrastructure.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves the use of various remote services to gain access to a network. While this could be used after initial access, it does not align with the development phase described in the question.

- **D: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves manipulating the system path to execute malicious code. This is a post-compromise technique and does not align with the development of custom tools and infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Identify the Context**: The question is asking about the development phase of the attack, specifically the use of PlugX and other tools linked to PRC-based infrastructure.
2. **Evaluate the Choices**:
   - **A: T1587-Develop Capabilities** fits the context of developing custom tools and infrastructure.
   - **B: T1584.007-Serverless** is not directly related to the development of custom tools.
   - **C: T1021-Remote Services** is a post-compromise technique.
   - **D: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path** is also a post-compromise technique.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the development of custom tools and infrastructure, which aligns with T1587-Develop Capabilities.

**Final Answer: A: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
