### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where spear phishing lures with malicious RTF documents are used to infect a user with QuasarRAT.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Spear phishing with malicious RTF documents.
  - Infection with QuasarRAT.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. While this could be used post-infection to maintain persistence, it is not the most likely technique to occur immediately before the execution of QuasarRAT.

- **Answer Choice B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the loading of dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to execute malicious code. This could be used to execute QuasarRAT, but it is not typically the immediate next step after a user opens a malicious RTF document.

- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to deliver a payload. The question already mentions that spear phishing with malicious RTF documents is used, so this is the initial step in the attack sequence, not the step that occurs before QuasarRAT execution.

- **Answer Choice D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malicious code. This is not relevant to the described attack sequence, which involves spear phishing with RTF documents.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attack sequence starts with spear phishing using malicious RTF documents.
  - The user opens the RTF document, which is the initial point of contact.
  - The next logical step is the execution of the payload (QuasarRAT) in the background.
  - Among the given choices, the most plausible technique that occurs before QuasarRAT execution is the initial phishing step (T1566-Phishing).

- **Final Answer**: C: T1566-Phishing
