### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Mustang Panda threat group. Specifically, it mentions that before fetching additional shellcode from a C2 (Command and Control) IP address, the PlugX implant was deployed during Command and Control operations. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to deploy the PlugX implant.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to transfer data. While this could be used for C2 communication, it is not specifically about deploying an implant.

- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. While this could be used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to the initial deployment of an implant.

- **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or files between systems within a network. While this could be used for lateral movement, it is not specifically about deploying an implant on the initial infected endpoint.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim network. This is a common method for deploying implants like PlugX, as it involves bringing the implant into the network from an external source.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Infection**: The threat actor gains initial access to the endpoint.
2. **Deployment of PlugX**: The PlugX implant is deployed on the infected endpoint.
3. **C2 Communication**: The PlugX implant communicates with the C2 server.
4. **Fetching Additional Shellcode**: The PlugX implant fetches additional shellcode from the C2 IP address.

Given the sequence, the most likely technique used to deploy the PlugX implant is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**. This technique aligns with the initial step of bringing the implant into the network from an external source.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
