### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT group. The key elements are:
- Conducting reconnaissance to identify targets' whereabouts.
- Conducting large-scale cryptographic operations.
- Utilizing Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
- **Description**: Acquiring infrastructure involves the adversary obtaining resources to support operations, such as servers, domains, and other network resources.
- **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the use of Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for infrastructure. It also fits the context of large-scale cryptographic operations, as the infrastructure would be necessary to support such operations.

**B: T1584.008-Network Devices**
- **Description**: This sub-technique involves targeting network devices to gain access or control over the network.
- **Relevance**: While this technique is related to network infrastructure, it does not specifically address the acquisition and use of web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps. It is more focused on network devices like routers and switches.

**C: T1056-Input Capture**
- **Description**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information.
- **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the acquisition of infrastructure or the use of web servers and dynamic DNS. It is more focused on capturing user data.

**D: T1608.006-SEO Poisoning**
- **Description**: This sub-technique involves manipulating search engine results to direct users to malicious sites.
- **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to redirect users to malicious infrastructure, it does not directly address the acquisition and use of web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps. It is more focused on manipulating search results.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The group conducts reconnaissance to identify targets' whereabouts.
2. **Acquire Infrastructure**: After identifying the targets, the group acquires the necessary infrastructure, including Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps.
3. **Cryptographic Operations**: The acquired infrastructure is used to support large-scale cryptographic operations.

**Final Answer: A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
