### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already transferred tools and established network tunnels for lateral movement. The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure secure communication with the compromised systems and to mimic normal traffic.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data from the compromised system to the attacker's command and control (C2) server. While this is a common post-compromise activity, it does not specifically address the need for secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.

- **B: T1137.005-Outlook Rules**
  - This technique involves using Outlook rules to automatically forward emails to an attacker-controlled email address. This is more about data exfiltration and persistence rather than secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.

- **C: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
  - This technique involves using algorithms to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communication. While it helps in evading detection, it does not directly address the need for secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.

- **D: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary system. Proxies can be used to secure communication by encrypting traffic and to mimic normal traffic by routing it through legitimate-looking servers. This aligns well with the need to ensure secure communication and mimic normal traffic.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question specifies the need for secure communication and mimicking normal traffic.
2. **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is more about data exfiltration.
3. **T1137.005-Outlook Rules** is about data exfiltration and persistence.
4. **T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms** is about evading detection but not specifically about secure communication.
5. **T1090-Proxy** is about routing traffic through an intermediary system, which can be used to secure communication and mimic normal traffic.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
