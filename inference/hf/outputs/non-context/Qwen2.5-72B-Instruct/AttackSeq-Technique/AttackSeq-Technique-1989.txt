### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an adversary uses HTML Smuggling in the ENVYSCOUT delivery script to bypass security controls.
   - After bypassing the security controls, a malicious DLL is loaded into a legitimate process using DLL Hijacking for defense evasion.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **HTML Smuggling (T1027.002)**: This technique involves using HTML to smuggle malicious content past security controls.
   - **DLL Hijacking (T1574.001)**: This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate process, allowing the adversary to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the legitimate process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**: This technique involves monitoring DNS traffic to gather information. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. While it could be related to loading a DLL, it is not specific to the DLL hijacking technique.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files to reveal their true content. It is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs described in the question.
   - **D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**: This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate process, which is exactly what is described in the question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **HTML Smuggling (T1027.002)**: The adversary uses this technique to bypass security controls.
2. **DLL Hijacking (T1574.001)**: After bypassing the security controls, the adversary uses this technique to load a malicious DLL into a legitimate process for defense evasion.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking
