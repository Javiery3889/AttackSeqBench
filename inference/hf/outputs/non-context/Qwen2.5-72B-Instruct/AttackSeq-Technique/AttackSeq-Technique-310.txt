### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary delivers a malicious email with a Word attachment that exploits an embedded .LNK object to gain initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence involves storing a .LNK file in the Startup directory to ensure the RAT (Remote Access Tool) remains active after system restarts, which is a persistence mechanism.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Exploiting an embedded .LNK object in a Word attachment.
   - Persistence: Storing a .LNK file in the Startup directory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP) to communicate with a command and control server. It is not directly related to the initial access or persistence mechanisms described in the question.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It is a plausible step that could occur after gaining initial access, as the adversary might use command-line tools to set up persistence.
   - **C: T1059.002-AppleScript**
     - This sub-technique is specific to AppleScript, which is used on macOS systems. The question does not specify that the attack is on a macOS system, and the use of a .LNK file suggests a Windows environment.
   - **D: T1592.002-Software**
     - This sub-technique involves using legitimate software to gather information. It is not directly related to the initial access or persistence mechanisms described in the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through the .LNK object, the adversary would use command-line tools or scripts to set up the persistence mechanism by storing a .LNK file in the Startup directory.
   - Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the persistence mechanism is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
