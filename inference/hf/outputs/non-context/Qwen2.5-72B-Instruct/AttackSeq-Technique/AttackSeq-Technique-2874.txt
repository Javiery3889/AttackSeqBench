### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the CCleaner malware:
1. The malware executed its initial payload.
2. It decrypted and loaded malicious components.
3. It attempted to establish communication with hardcoded Command and Control (C2) servers.
4. In the absence of a response from the hardcoded C2 servers, it used a fallback Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to establish communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud logs to prevent detection. While this could be part of the malware's behavior, it is not directly related to the sequence of establishing communication with C2 servers.

- **B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While this could be used to load malicious components, it does not specifically address the communication with C2 servers.

- **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves using dynamic resolution to resolve domain names, which is a key step in establishing communication with C2 servers. This is particularly relevant to the fallback DGA mechanism described in the question.

- **D: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols for communication. While this could be a method of C2 communication, it is not specifically related to the DGA mechanism described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware executed its initial payload and loaded malicious components.
2. It attempted to communicate with hardcoded C2 servers.
3. When the hardcoded C2 servers did not respond, it used a fallback DGA to establish communication.

The most relevant technique in this sequence is **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**, as it directly relates to the process of resolving domain names, which is essential for the DGA mechanism to function.

**Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
