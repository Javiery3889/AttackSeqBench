### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the Duke group uses Seaduke to gather system information and perform updates. The communication with the C2 server is over HTTP/HTTPS, and the communication is secure.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Seaduke**: A malware used for information gathering and updates.
  - **C2 Server**: Command and Control server.
  - **Secure Communication**: Over HTTP/HTTPS.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to network resources.
  - **Evaluation**: This does not align with the described scenario of secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communication.
  - **Evaluation**: The question specifically mentions HTTP/HTTPS, not mail protocols. This is not a good fit.

- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications from detection and analysis.
  - **Evaluation**: HTTP/HTTPS is a common method for encrypted communication. This aligns well with the described scenario of secure communication.

- **Answer Choice D: T1505.002-Transport Agent**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using transport agents to intercept and manipulate email traffic.
  - **Evaluation**: This does not align with the described scenario of secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes secure communication over HTTP/HTTPS.
  - HTTP/HTTPS is a form of encrypted communication.
  - T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant technique for this scenario.
- **Conclusion**:
  - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
