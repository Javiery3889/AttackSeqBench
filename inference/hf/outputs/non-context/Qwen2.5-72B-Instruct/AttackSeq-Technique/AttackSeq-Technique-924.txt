### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime to execute tasks.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to maintain the Trojan's presence across reboots, specifically under paths such as `%systemroot%\system32` or `%programfiles%`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Dynamic Loading of DLL:** The Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The Trojan needs to maintain its presence across reboots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1543 - Create or Modify System Process:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it typically involves creating or modifying services, scheduled tasks, or other system processes, not necessarily placing files in specific directories.
   - **B: T1110 - Brute Force:**
     - This technique involves attempting to gain access to accounts by guessing passwords. It is not relevant to maintaining persistence across reboots.
   - **C: T1129 - Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves loading shared modules (DLLs) into the memory of a process. While it is related to dynamic loading, it does not directly address maintaining persistence across reboots.
   - **D: T1574.014 - AppDomainManager:**
     - This technique involves using the AppDomainManager to load and execute arbitrary code in the context of a .NET application. It is a specific method for maintaining persistence but is not typically associated with placing files in system directories.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible technique for maintaining the Trojan's presence across reboots by placing files in system directories is **T1543 - Create or Modify System Process**. This technique can involve creating or modifying system processes, such as services or registry keys, to ensure that the Trojan is executed at system startup.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1543 - Create or Modify System Process
