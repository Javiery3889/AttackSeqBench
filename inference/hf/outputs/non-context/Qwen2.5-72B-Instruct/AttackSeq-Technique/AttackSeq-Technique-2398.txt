### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by TDrop2:
1. **Process Hollowing**: This is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
2. **Disguised Payload Retrieval**: This involves retrieving additional payloads in a way that avoids detection by security systems.

The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next, specifically to gather details about the infected system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically focused on gathering system information.

- **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This aligns well with the need to gather details about the infected system.

- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique is used to detect and evade virtualized environments and sandboxes. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not directly related to gathering system information.

- **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: This technique involves compressing data using a library to reduce the size or to obfuscate the data. This is not related to gathering system information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Process Hollowing and Disguised Payload Retrieval**: These techniques are used to evade detection and establish a foothold on the system.
2. **Next Step**: After evading detection and establishing a foothold, the next logical step is to gather information about the system to understand the environment and plan further actions.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1106-Native API**: Not specific to gathering system information.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**: Directly related to gathering system information.
   - **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: Not directly related to gathering system information.
   - **D: T1560.002-Archive via Library**: Not related to gathering system information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
