### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware communicated with the C2 (Command and Control) servers by encrypting data using AES and base64 encoding.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to obfuscate the origin of the traffic, it is not directly related to the encryption and encoding of data before communication with the C2 server.

- **B: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services (like RDP, SSH) to gain access to a system. While it is a common initial access technique, it does not directly relate to the encryption and encoding of data for C2 communication.

- **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to defenders. The question specifically mentions that the data was encrypted using AES and base64 encoded, which aligns directly with the Data Encoding technique. This technique is often used to prepare data before it is sent to the C2 server.

- **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
  - This technique involves staging additional capabilities on the compromised system, such as downloading additional malware components. While it is a common post-compromise technique, it does not directly relate to the encryption and encoding of data for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Context**: The question is about the sequence of TTPs leading up to the communication with the C2 server, specifically focusing on the encryption and encoding of data.
2. **Evaluate Each Option**:
   - **A: T1090.002-External Proxy** - Not directly related to data encryption and encoding.
   - **B: T1021-Remote Services** - Not directly related to data encryption and encoding.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding** - Directly related to the encryption and encoding of data.
   - **D: T1608-Stage Capabilities** - Not directly related to data encryption and encoding.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence is that the data was encoded (T1132) before it was sent to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
