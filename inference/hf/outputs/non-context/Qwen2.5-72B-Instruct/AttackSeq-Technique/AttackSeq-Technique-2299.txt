### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before DNSpionage's use of malicious techniques to redirect traffic for reconnaissance purposes involving victim network infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which is a common initial step in reconnaissance. It helps the attacker understand the network topology, IP addresses, and other relevant details before launching more targeted attacks.

- **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying email rules to hide or redirect emails. While it can be used for reconnaissance, it is more specific to email-based attacks and less likely to be a precursor to DNS redirection.

- **C: T1590.005-IP Addresses**
  - This technique involves gathering IP addresses of the victim's network. This is a more specific form of network information gathering and is a logical step before DNS redirection, as the attacker needs to know the IP addresses to effectively redirect traffic.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific times. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not typically a reconnaissance technique and is more likely to be used for persistence or execution.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The initial phase of an attack often involves gathering information about the victim's network to understand its structure and vulnerabilities.
2. **Gathering Network Information**: Techniques like T1590-Gather Victim Network Information and T1590.005-IP Addresses are crucial in this phase.
3. **DNS Redirection**: Once the attacker has gathered the necessary network information, they can proceed to redirect traffic using DNSpionage techniques.

Given the context, the most logical sequence is that the attacker would first gather network information, including IP addresses, before redirecting traffic.

**Final Answer: C: T1590.005-IP Addresses**
