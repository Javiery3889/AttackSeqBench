### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes the attack flow of the Darkhotel APT group, specifically focusing on the technique used to gain initial access. The attack involves:
- Compromising trusted commercial network resources globally.
- Using malware disguised as legitimate software updates to gain initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1546.016-Installer Packages**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating installer packages to execute malicious code. While this could be used to deliver malware, it is more about the delivery mechanism after gaining initial access, not the initial compromise itself.

- **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or acquiring tools and capabilities to support the attack. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it is not specific to gaining initial access through the described method.

- **C: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
  - This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship to gain access to a network. This aligns well with the described attack, where the APT group compromises trusted commercial network resources and uses them to deliver malware.

- **D: T1583.001-Domains**
  - This technique involves registering or acquiring domains to support the attack. While this can be part of the attack preparation, it is not directly related to the initial access method described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources**: The APT group first compromises trusted commercial network resources. This is a critical step in establishing a trusted relationship.
2. **Using Malware Disguised as Legitimate Software Updates**: Once the trusted relationship is established, the APT group uses this trust to deliver malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
3. **Gaining Initial Access**: The malware, when executed, provides the APT group with initial access to the target network.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred prior to gaining initial access is **T1199-Trusted Relationship**.

**Final Answer: C: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
