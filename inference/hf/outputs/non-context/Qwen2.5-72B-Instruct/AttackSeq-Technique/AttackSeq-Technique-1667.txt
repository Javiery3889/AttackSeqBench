### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where BlueBravo:
1. Leveraged compromised infrastructure.
2. Reused general themes for lures.
3. Delivered malware through spearphishing emails and malicious links during the initial access phase.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the delivery of malware through spearphishing emails and malicious links.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**
  - This technique involves forcing a system to use a less secure protocol or configuration. It is typically used to exploit vulnerabilities in the communication or authentication process. This does not align well with the initial access phase described in the question.

- **B: T1588.002-Tool**
  - This technique involves obtaining or creating tools to support operations. While this could be relevant, it is more about the preparation phase rather than the initial access phase.

- **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - This technique involves degrading or disabling security controls to avoid detection. This could be relevant, but it is more likely to occur after gaining initial access to ensure persistence and stealth.

- **D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves acquiring the tools, techniques, and methods necessary to support operations. This is a broad category that includes obtaining tools, credentials, and other resources. Given that BlueBravo leveraged compromised infrastructure and reused general themes for lures, it is likely that they obtained the necessary capabilities to carry out the spearphishing attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Leveraged Compromised Infrastructure**: This suggests that BlueBravo had already gained some level of access or control over certain systems or networks.
2. **Reused General Themes for Lures**: This indicates that they had prepared or obtained the necessary content to make their spearphishing emails more convincing.
3. **Delivered Malware through Spearphishing Emails and Malicious Links**: This is the final step in the initial access phase.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before delivering malware through spearphishing emails and malicious links is obtaining the necessary capabilities to carry out the attack.

**Final Answer: D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
