### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where the Sednit group's malware uses an AutoIt downloader to gather system information. After the system is deemed an interesting target by the server, the next step in the attack sequence is to be determined.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
  - This technique involves weakening encryption to facilitate further attacks. While it could be a part of a broader attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after reconnaissance and target identification.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. This is a plausible next step after reconnaissance, as the attacker would need to establish a communication channel to exfiltrate data or receive further instructions.

- **C: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**
  - This technique involves creating and using Kerberos service tickets to authenticate to services. This is a more advanced technique typically used after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network. It is less likely to be the immediate next step after reconnaissance.

- **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - This technique involves using remote access software to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system. This is a plausible next step after reconnaissance, as the attacker would want to establish a persistent presence on the target system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance and Target Identification**: The Sednit group's malware uses an AutoIt downloader to gather system information and determine if the target is of interest.
2. **Next Step**: After identifying the target as interesting, the attacker would likely want to establish a communication channel or a persistent presence on the system.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **T1600-Weaken Encryption**: Not the immediate next step.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Plausible for establishing communication.
   - **T1558.002-Silver Ticket**: Advanced and less immediate.
   - **T1219-Remote Access Software**: Plausible for maintaining persistence.

Given the context, the most plausible next step after reconnaissance and target identification is to establish a communication channel or a persistent presence on the system. Both T1071 and T1219 are plausible, but T1219 (Remote Access Software) is more directly related to maintaining control and persistence, which is a common next step after initial reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
