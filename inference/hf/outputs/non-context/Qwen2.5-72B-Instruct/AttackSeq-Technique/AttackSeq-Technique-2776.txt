### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker:
1. Uses backdoor malware embedded within trusted software for stealthy code execution.
2. Maintains access.
3. Leverages the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement within the victim network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1136-Create Account**
  - This technique involves creating a new account on the victim's system. While this can be used to maintain access, it is not the most stealthy or common method after using backdoor malware. It is more likely to be used in the initial stages of an attack or for persistence.

- **B: T1586-Compromise Accounts**
  - This technique involves compromising existing accounts on the victim's system. This can be a method to maintain access, but it is more about gaining initial access rather than maintaining it after the backdoor malware is already in place.

- **C: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking dynamic library (dylib) files to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is more about code execution and less about maintaining access in the context of a backdoor malware scenario.

- **D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
  - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute malicious code every time PowerShell is run. This is a common method for maintaining access because it ensures that the backdoor malware is executed regularly, providing persistent access to the system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker uses backdoor malware embedded within trusted software for stealthy code execution.
2. To maintain access, the attacker needs a method that ensures the backdoor malware is consistently active.
3. Among the given choices, **T1546.013-PowerShell Profile** is the most plausible technique for maintaining access because it ensures that the backdoor malware is executed every time PowerShell is run, providing persistent access to the system.

**Final Answer: D: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
