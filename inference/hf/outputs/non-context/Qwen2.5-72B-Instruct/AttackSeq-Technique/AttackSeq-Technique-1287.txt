### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tropic Trooper backdoor:
1. The backdoor decrypted its configuration file.
2. It connected using the SSL protocol.
3. It leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1598.001-Spearphishing Service**
  - This technique involves using a service to send spearphishing emails. It is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain initial access to a target system. This does not align with the sequence described, which is focused on the backdoor's communication with the C&C server.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with the C&C server. The question mentions that the backdoor connected using the SSL protocol, which is a form of encrypted communication. This aligns well with the sequence described, as the backdoor would need to establish an encrypted channel before leveraging custom SSL libraries.

- **C: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While steganography can be used to conceal data, it is not typically used in the context of establishing a secure connection to a C&C server. This does not align with the sequence described.

- **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malware. This is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack, such as deploying the backdoor on the target system, but not to the communication with the C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The backdoor decrypted its configuration file.
2. It connected using the SSL protocol.
3. It leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server.

The most plausible technique that occurred before the backdoor leveraged custom SSL libraries to securely connect to the C&C server is the establishment of an encrypted channel (T1573).

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
