### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Infamous Chisel achieved persistence by replacing the legitimate `netd` system binary at `/system/bin/netd` and leveraging `init` to execute it with root privileges.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying network services and their configurations. While this can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to achieving persistence by replacing a system binary.

- **B: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. This is more relevant to Windows systems and is not typically used on Android or Linux systems where `init` is more common.

- **C: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions. This could be relevant if the attacker needed to manipulate system files or execute commands with elevated privileges, which is necessary for replacing a system binary and ensuring it runs with root privileges.

- **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves concealing the attacker's infrastructure, such as IP addresses or domain names. This is not directly related to achieving persistence by replacing a system binary.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Relevance to the Attack Sequence:**
   - The attack sequence involves replacing a system binary (`netd`) and ensuring it runs with root privileges.
   - This requires the attacker to have the ability to manipulate system files and execute commands with elevated privileges.

2. **Evaluation of Techniques:**
   - **T1046-Network Service Discovery** is more about reconnaissance and not directly related to file manipulation or privilege escalation.
   - **T1053.002-At** is specific to Windows and not relevant to the context of an Android or Linux system.
   - **T1106-Native API** is directly relevant because it involves calling system APIs to perform actions, which is necessary for replacing a system binary and ensuring it runs with root privileges.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure** is about concealing the attacker's infrastructure and not related to file manipulation or persistence.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible technique that occurred before the attacker achieved persistence by replacing the `netd` system binary is **T1106-Native API**.

Final Answer: **C: T1106-Native API**
