### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor UNC1945.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing persistence by placing a copy of a legitimate `pam_unix.so` file and the SLAPSTICK backdoor in the `/lib64/security` folder.
     - Employing anti-forensics techniques using the custom ELF utility LOGBLEACH to clean logs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. While this could be a part of the initial stages of the attack, it does not directly relate to the sequence of actions described in the question, which focuses on persistence and anti-forensics.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1216.001-PubPrn**
     - This technique involves using the `pubprn.vbs` script to execute arbitrary code. This is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to avoid detection. The question explicitly mentions the use of LOGBLEACH to clean logs, which is a form of indicator removal.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to achieve persistence. While this could be relevant to establishing persistence, the question already mentions the use of a backdoor and a legitimate file to achieve persistence, making this choice less likely to be the most relevant.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question involves establishing persistence and then using anti-forensics techniques to clean logs.
   - The most relevant technique to the anti-forensics step is T1070-Indicator Removal, as it directly aligns with the use of LOGBLEACH to clean logs.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1070-Indicator Removal occurred before the anti-forensics techniques were employed.

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
