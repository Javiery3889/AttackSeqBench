### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the malware "Smooth Operator" is executed as part of the 3CX software. Specifically, it runs its functionality in a new thread and initiates through a constructor function within a dynamic library (dylib).

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
  - This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is not directly related to the execution of malware in a new thread or through a constructor function.

- **B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and defenses. While this could be a subsequent step in the attack, it is not directly related to the initial execution of the malware in a new thread.

- **C: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking a remote service session, which is not directly related to the execution of malware in a new thread or through a constructor function.

- **D: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**
  - This technique involves using sudo and sudo caching to gain elevated privileges. While this could be a subsequent step in the attack, it is not directly related to the initial execution of the malware in a new thread.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The malware "Smooth Operator" is executed as part of the 3CX software, running its functionality in a new thread and initiating through a constructor function within a dylib.
2. **Subsequent Steps**: After the initial execution, the malware might perform various actions, such as impairing defenses, hijacking sessions, or gaining elevated privileges.
3. **Relevance of Answer Choices**:
   - **A: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository** is not directly related to the initial execution.
   - **B: T1562-Impair Defenses** could be a subsequent step but is not directly related to the initial execution.
   - **C: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking** is not directly related to the initial execution.
   - **D: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching** could be a subsequent step but is not directly related to the initial execution.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve the malware executing its functionality in a new thread and then potentially impairing defenses to maintain persistence or avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
