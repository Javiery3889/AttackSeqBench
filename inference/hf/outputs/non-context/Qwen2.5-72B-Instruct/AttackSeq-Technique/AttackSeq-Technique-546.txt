### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
  1. Visitors to compromised websites are exposed to browser fingerprinting exploits for initial access.
  2. Malicious scripts communicate with C&C servers using HTTPS.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely involved in acquiring domain names and renting servers to support the attack.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is typically used to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or to install malware. This does not align with acquiring domain names and renting servers.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1561-Disk Wipe**
  - Disk Wipe involves destroying data on a disk to prevent recovery. This technique is used to destroy evidence or render systems inoperable. It does not align with the initial setup of infrastructure.

- **Answer Choice C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
  - Acquire Infrastructure involves obtaining resources such as domain names, servers, and other infrastructure to support the attack. This aligns perfectly with the need to acquire domain names and rent servers.

- **Answer Choice D: T1584.006-Web Services**
  - Web Services involves using web services to host or deliver malicious content. While this could be part of the attack, it does not specifically address the acquisition of infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically asks about the acquisition of domain names and servers, which is a preparatory step before the actual attack can take place.
  - Among the given choices, T1583-Acquire Infrastructure is the only technique that directly addresses the acquisition of the necessary infrastructure to support the attack.
  - The other choices (T1566-Phishing, T1561-Disk Wipe, and T1584.006-Web Services) do not fit the context of acquiring infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
