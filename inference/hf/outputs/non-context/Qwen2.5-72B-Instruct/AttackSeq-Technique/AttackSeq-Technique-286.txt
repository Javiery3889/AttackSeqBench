### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained through spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks. After gaining access, the Dropping Elephant backdoor is used to execute encoded blobs to evade detection.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Initial Access: Spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks.
  - Execution: Dropping Elephant backdoor.
  - Evasion: Execution of encoded blobs.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information. It is often used to reveal the true content of files that are initially obfuscated to evade detection.
  - **Fit**: This fits well with the scenario where the Dropping Elephant backdoor executes encoded blobs. Before the blobs can be executed, they need to be deobfuscated or decoded.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071.002 - File Transfer Protocols**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using file transfer protocols to exfiltrate data or transfer files.
  - **Fit**: This does not fit well with the scenario of executing encoded blobs to evade detection. It is more about data exfiltration or file transfer, not the initial execution of the backdoor.

- **Answer Choice C: T1027.006 - HTML Smuggling**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML files to bypass security controls.
  - **Fit**: While this could be used in the initial access phase (e.g., through a spear-phishing document), it does not directly relate to the execution of encoded blobs by the Dropping Elephant backdoor.

- **Answer Choice D: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with remote systems.
  - **Fit**: This is a broader category and could be relevant in various stages of the attack, but it does not specifically address the execution of encoded blobs to evade detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access through spear-phishing documents or watering hole attacks.
2. **Backdoor Execution**: The Dropping Elephant backdoor is deployed.
3. **Evasion**: The backdoor executes encoded blobs to evade detection.
4. **Deobfuscation/Decoding**: Before the encoded blobs can be executed, they need to be deobfuscated or decoded.

**Final Answer: A: T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
