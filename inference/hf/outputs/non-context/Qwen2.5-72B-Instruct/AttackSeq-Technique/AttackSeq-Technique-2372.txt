### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where malware collects detailed system and drive information using specific components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll).
- The focus is on the technique used to securely deliver commands for the malware's operations.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves the use of legitimate domain accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for initial access or lateral movement, it does not directly relate to the secure delivery of commands.
- **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This technique involves manipulating network traffic to blend in with normal traffic, which can be used to avoid detection. However, it does not specifically address the secure delivery of commands.
- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. It is more about post-attack cleanup rather than command delivery.
- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of command and control (C2) communications. This is directly relevant to the secure delivery of commands.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware collects detailed system and drive information, which suggests it is gathering data to facilitate further operations.
- The question specifically asks about the secure delivery of commands, which implies the need for a method to protect the communication between the malware and its controller.
- Among the given choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need for secure communication, ensuring that commands are delivered without being intercepted or tampered with.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
