### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in the CostaRicto Campaign.
- The sequence includes the use of scripts and PowerShell loaders to inject payloads into memory.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before network service scanning tools like pscan and nmap were used.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information to reveal the actual content. This is often used to hide the true nature of the payload before it is executed. However, this technique is typically used earlier in the attack chain, before the payload is injected into memory.
- **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves scheduling a task or job using container orchestration tools. This is not typically related to the initial stages of payload injection or network scanning.
- **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves altering data to make it less conspicuous or to hide its true nature. This is often used to evade detection but is not directly related to the sequence of injecting payloads and then scanning the network.
- **T1218.013-Mavinject**: This technique involves using a legitimate system binary (mavinject) to load a malicious payload into the memory of a process. This aligns well with the described sequence of using scripts and PowerShell loaders to inject payloads into memory.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence described involves using scripts and PowerShell loaders to inject payloads into memory.
2. Before network service scanning tools like pscan and nmap are used, the payload must be successfully injected into memory.
3. T1218.013-Mavinject is a technique that fits this description, as it involves using a legitimate system binary to load a malicious payload into memory.
4. The other techniques (T1140, T1053.007, and T1001) do not align as closely with the described sequence of events.

**Final Answer: D: T1218.013-Mavinject**
