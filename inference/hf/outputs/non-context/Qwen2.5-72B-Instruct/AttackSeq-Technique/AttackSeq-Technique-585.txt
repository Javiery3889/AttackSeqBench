### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by threat actors:
     - Using the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
     - Dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
     - Using the Impacket tool `atexec` to run commands on other systems in the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after using `atexec`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1087 - Account Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying active user accounts and their roles. It is typically used early in the attack to gather information about the environment.
     - This does not align well with the sequence described, as the focus is on command execution and lateral movement.

   - **T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares:**
     - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) to access administrative shares on remote systems.
     - While this could be used for lateral movement, the question specifically mentions using `atexec`, which is a different method.

   - **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material:**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems.
     - This aligns well with the sequence, as the threat actors have already dumped credentials using Mimikatz and are using them to run commands on other systems.

   - **T1137 - Office Application Startup:**
     - This technique involves using Office applications to execute code at startup.
     - This does not align with the sequence described, as the focus is on command execution and lateral movement, not on Office applications.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described involves:
     - Using a webshell to run commands and upload tools.
     - Dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
     - Using `atexec` to run commands on other systems.
   - After dumping credentials, the most logical next step is to use those credentials to authenticate to other systems and execute commands.
   - The technique that best fits this scenario is **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
