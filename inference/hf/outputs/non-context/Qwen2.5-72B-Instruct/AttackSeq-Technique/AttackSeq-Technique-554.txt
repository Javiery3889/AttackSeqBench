### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where MuddyWater attackers used open-source tools like Meterpreter and Mimikatz to evade defenses. The focus is on the technique used to facilitate communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - Traffic Signaling involves using legitimate services to blend in with normal network traffic. While this can be used to evade detection, it does not specifically address the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication.

- **B: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
  - Hidden File System involves hiding files or directories to avoid detection. This technique is not related to communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - Application Layer Protocol involves using standard network protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This technique is highly relevant to the use of domains and proxy URLs for communication.

- **D: T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt**
  - Elevated Execution with Prompt involves gaining higher privileges by prompting the user. This technique is not related to communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Key Elements**: The question focuses on communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs.
2. **Evaluate the Techniques**:
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: Not specific to domains and proxy URLs.
   - **T1564.005-Hidden File System**: Not related to communication.
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Directly related to using standard protocols for communication, which can include domains and proxy URLs.
   - **T1548.004-Elevated Execution with Prompt**: Not related to communication.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for facilitating communication with compromised systems using domains and proxy URLs is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
