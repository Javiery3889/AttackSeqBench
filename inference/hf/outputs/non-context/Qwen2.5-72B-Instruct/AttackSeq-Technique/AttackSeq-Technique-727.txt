### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which are encrypted with RC4 and encoded with Base64.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence, which involves transferring collected data out of the compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1505 - Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate server software to host malicious content or to maintain persistence. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves adversaries exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. Given that the Rising Sun implant is already communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests, this is a strong candidate.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It does not directly relate to the exfiltration of data.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1567.002 - Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves adversaries exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. While this is a valid exfiltration method, the question specifically mentions that the data is being transferred over the same C2 channel, which is HTTP POST requests.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible technique for transferring collected data out of the compromised systems is **T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

**Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
