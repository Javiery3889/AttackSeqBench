### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a macOS attack sequence where ChromeLoader gained initial access through a DMG file containing a shell script. The attacker then established persistence using a Chrome browser extension.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: DMG file with a shell script.
  - Persistence: Chrome browser extension.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1176-Browser Extensions**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of browser extensions to maintain persistence or execute other actions.
  - **Relevance**: This is the technique used to establish persistence with a Chrome browser extension, which is mentioned in the question. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **after** initial access but **before** persistence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying or replacing the LSASS driver to achieve persistence or privilege escalation.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically associated with macOS and is more relevant to Windows systems. It does not fit the context of the attack sequence described.

- **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server or to exfiltrate data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could occur after initial access and before persistence, as the attacker might use web services to communicate with the C2 server or to download additional payloads.

- **Answer Choice D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to use it for malicious purposes, such as hosting malware or C2 servers.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about the initial setup of the attack infrastructure and is less likely to occur between initial access and persistence in the described sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access through a DMG file containing a shell script.
2. **Post-Initial Access**: The attacker likely needs to communicate with a C2 server or download additional payloads to prepare for establishing persistence.
3. **Persistence**: The attacker establishes persistence using a Chrome browser extension.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that occurs after initial access but before persistence is **T1102-Web Service**. This technique fits the context of the attack sequence, as the attacker would need to communicate with a C2 server or download additional payloads before setting up persistence.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
