### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Disttrack dropper:
1. The dropper extracts its modules using an XOR cipher and a base64 encoded string as the key.
2. The wiper module overwrites the MBR, partitions, and files on the system using the RawDisk driver.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the wiper module overwrites the system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**
  - This technique involves shutting down or rebooting the system. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not a necessary step before overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files. The wiper module can overwrite these components without a system shutdown or reboot.

- **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it. The question already mentions that the dropper uses an XOR cipher and a base64 encoded string to extract its modules, which is a form of data encoding. However, this encoding is part of the extraction process, not a separate step before the wiper module overwrites the system.

- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. This could be relevant if the wiper module is executed through a command-line interface or script. However, the question does not provide specific information about the execution method of the wiper module.

- **D: T1090.004-Domain Fronting**
  - This technique involves using domain fronting to mask the true destination of network traffic. This is not relevant to the process of overwriting the MBR, partitions, and files on the system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the dropper extracting its modules using an XOR cipher and a base64 encoded string (T1132-Data Encoding).
- After the modules are extracted, the wiper module overwrites the MBR, partitions, and files on the system using the RawDisk driver.

Given the options, the most relevant technique that aligns with the described sequence is **T1132-Data Encoding**.

**Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding**
