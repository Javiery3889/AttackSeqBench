### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes the initial stages of an attack by UNC1151, specifically focusing on their efforts to understand details about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses before gaining initial access through spear phishing campaigns.
- The key phrase is "efforts to understand details about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses."

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1591.004-Identify Roles**
  - This technique involves identifying specific roles within an organization, which is useful for targeting specific individuals. However, it does not directly align with the broader effort to understand details about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves the actual execution of phishing campaigns, which is a method of gaining initial access. The question specifically asks about the efforts to understand details before the phishing campaign, so this is not the correct choice.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1586.002-Email Accounts**
  - This technique involves identifying and targeting specific email accounts. While it is related to the phishing campaign, it is more specific and does not cover the broader reconnaissance efforts described in the question.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which can include details about webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses. This aligns well with the efforts to understand details about the victims before launching a spear phishing campaign.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the initial reconnaissance phase where UNC1151 is gathering information about potential victims.
- The most relevant technique for this phase is T1590-Gather Victim Network Information, as it encompasses the broader effort to understand details about victim webmail providers, government entities, and private businesses.
- The other answer choices are either too specific (T1586.002-Email Accounts, T1591.004-Identify Roles) or occur after the reconnaissance phase (T1566-Phishing).

**Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
