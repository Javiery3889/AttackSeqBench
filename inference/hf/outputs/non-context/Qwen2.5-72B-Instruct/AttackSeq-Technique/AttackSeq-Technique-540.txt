### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malware named PIVY. The sequence includes:
1. Establishing persistence by installing itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
2. Evading detection while utilizing DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1200-Hardware Additions**
  - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not align with the described sequence, which focuses on software-based persistence and evasion techniques.

- **B: T1562.011-Spoof Security Alerting**
  - This technique involves creating fake security alerts to mislead users or administrators. While it can be used for evasion, it does not directly relate to the use of DLL sideloading or modifying malware configuration.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. This aligns well with the described sequence, as hiding artifacts can include techniques like DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration to avoid detection by security tools.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. While it is a common evasion technique, it does not directly relate to the specific methods of DLL sideloading and modifying malware configuration mentioned in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence via .lnk in the Windows Startup folder**: This is a common method for establishing persistence, allowing the malware to run automatically when the system starts.
2. **Evading detection**: The malware uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to avoid detection. DLL sideloading involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one, which can help the malware remain hidden.
3. **Hiding artifacts**: The technique of hiding artifacts (T1564) is the most relevant here, as it encompasses methods to avoid detection, including DLL sideloading and configuration modifications.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
