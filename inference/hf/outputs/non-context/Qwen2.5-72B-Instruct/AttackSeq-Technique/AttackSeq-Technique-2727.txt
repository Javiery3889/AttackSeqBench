### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group. The sequence is as follows:
1. Discovery activities (network share and process discovery).
2. An unknown technique.
3. Using compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote command execution. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is typically used after gaining initial access and before or during the exploitation of network segmentation. However, it doesn't directly fit the context of using compromised router virtual machines.

- **B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or files to a remote system to facilitate lateral movement. This fits well in the sequence because after discovering the network and processes, the attackers would need to transfer tools to the compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

- **C: T1587.004-Exploits**
  - This technique involves using exploits to gain initial access or to escalate privileges. While exploits are a crucial part of many attack sequences, they are typically used earlier in the attack, often before discovery activities.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This is usually a post-exploitation activity and does not fit well in the sequence described, which is focused on lateral movement and network segmentation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Activities**: The attackers have already conducted network share and process discovery.
2. **Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570)**: After discovering the network, the attackers would need to transfer tools to the compromised router virtual machines to facilitate further actions.
3. **Overcoming Network Segmentation**: Using the compromised router virtual machines to overcome network segmentation.

**Final Answer: B: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
