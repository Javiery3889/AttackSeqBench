### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence involving the Regin malware. It mentions the execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers for managing payloads and the subsequent stealing of credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Before**: Execution of encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers for managing payloads.
  - **After**: Stealing credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may enumerate files and directories to gain an understanding of the system's structure and identify potential targets.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used early in an attack to gather information about the system. It is less likely to occur after the execution of EVFS containers and before stealing credentials.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use hidden file systems to hide data and tools from defenders.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is related to the use of hidden file systems, which aligns with the use of EVFS containers. However, it is more about the initial setup rather than the sequence described.

- **Answer Choice C: T1218.011-Rundll32**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use the rundll32 utility to execute code, often to load malicious DLLs.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is commonly used to execute payloads and could logically follow the execution of EVFS containers. It is a plausible step before stealing credentials, as it can be used to load the necessary tools or code to perform credential theft.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may hide artifacts to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about concealing the presence of malicious activities, which could be relevant at various stages of the attack. However, it is less specific to the sequence described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Setup**: The execution of EVFS containers for managing payloads suggests that the malware has already established a foothold and is preparing to execute its payload.
2. **Payload Execution**: The next logical step would be to execute the payload, which could involve using a utility like rundll32 to load and run malicious code.
3. **Credential Theft**: After the payload is executed, the malware can then proceed to steal credentials from Internet Explorer LegacySettings.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that fits between the execution of EVFS containers and the stealing of credentials is the use of rundll32 to execute the necessary code.

**Final Answer: C: T1218.011-Rundll32**
