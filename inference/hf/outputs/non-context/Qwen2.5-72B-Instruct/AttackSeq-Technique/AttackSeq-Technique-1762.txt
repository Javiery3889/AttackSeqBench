### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary has already executed malicious VBS scripts and maintained persistence through scheduled tasks. The next step in the sequence involves downloading additional payloads from a C&C (Command and Control) server.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Execution of malicious VBS scripts.
  - Persistence through scheduled tasks.
  - Downloading additional payloads from a C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries transferring tools (such as other malware or files) from a remote system into the victim network.
  - **Relevance**: This fits the scenario where Shuckworm downloads additional payloads from their C&C server. The C&C server acts as the remote system from which the tools are transferred.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute their tools or scripts at a specific time or on a regular basis.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the persistence mechanism. It does not fit the next step of downloading additional payloads.

- **Answer Choice C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries using multiple proxies to obfuscate their network traffic and hide the true source of their commands.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used in conjunction with C&C communications, it is not specifically about downloading additional payloads.

- **Answer Choice D: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries stealing credentials from keychain storage.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not related to the downloading of additional payloads from a C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution of Malicious VBS Scripts**: The initial step in the attack sequence.
2. **Persistence through Scheduled Tasks**: The adversary ensures that the malicious scripts run regularly.
3. **Downloading Additional Payloads from C&C Server**: The next logical step in the attack sequence is to download additional tools or malware from the C&C server to further the attack.

Given the context, the most plausible technique for downloading additional payloads from a C&C server is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
