### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries have already automated the exfiltration of AWS credentials over a C2 server.
   - The next step in the sequence is to achieve the main objective, which is executing cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Exfiltration of AWS credentials over C2 server:** This is the initial step.
   - **Main objective: Executing cryptocurrency mining:** This is the final step.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
     - This technique involves using Office applications to execute code or maintain persistence. It is typically used in the early stages of an attack to gain initial access or establish persistence. It does not fit well between exfiltration and cryptocurrency mining.
   - **B: T1496-Resource Hijacking**
     - This technique involves using the victim's resources (e.g., CPU, GPU) to perform tasks, such as cryptocurrency mining. This fits well between exfiltration and the main objective of executing cryptocurrency mining.
   - **C: T1611-Escape to Host**
     - This technique involves escaping from a sandbox or virtual environment to gain access to the host system. It is more relevant to initial access or privilege escalation and does not fit well between exfiltration and cryptocurrency mining.
   - **D: T1496-Resource Hijacking**
     - This is the same as option B and fits well between exfiltration and the main objective of executing cryptocurrency mining.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. Exfiltration of AWS credentials over C2 server.
     2. Resource Hijacking (T1496) to use the victim's resources for cryptocurrency mining.
     3. Executing cryptocurrency mining as the main objective.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1496-Resource Hijacking
