### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where an APT group (Naikon) has already performed internal reconnaissance on a victim machine, gathering data such as system architecture and open TCP/UDP tables.
- **Key Task**: Determine the most likely ATT&CK technique used to securely transmit this data to the C&C domain.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1132.001-Standard Encoding**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to defenders. While encoding can be used to obfuscate data, it does not inherently provide secure transmission.
  - **Evaluation**: This is not the most likely choice because it does not ensure secure transmission, which is a key requirement in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. It is not related to the transmission of data.
  - **Evaluation**: This is not relevant to the scenario of securely transmitting data to a C&C domain.

- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission. This is a common method for securely transmitting data to a C&C server.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a strong candidate because it directly addresses the need for secure transmission of data.

- **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves gathering system information, which is part of the reconnaissance phase. It does not involve the transmission of data.
  - **Evaluation**: This is not relevant to the scenario of transmitting data to a C&C domain.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The APT group has already gathered system architecture and open TCP/UDP table information.
2. **Data Transmission**: The next step is to securely transmit this data to the C&C domain.
3. **Secure Transmission Requirement**: The question emphasizes the need for secure transmission.
4. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **T1132.001-Standard Encoding**: Not sufficient for secure transmission.
   - **T1078-Valid Accounts**: Not related to data transmission.
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Directly addresses secure transmission.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: Not related to data transmission.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
