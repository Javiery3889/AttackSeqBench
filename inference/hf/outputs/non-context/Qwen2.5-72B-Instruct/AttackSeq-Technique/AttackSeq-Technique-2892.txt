### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the 'yty' framework establishes persistence through a secondary macro in an Excel document named 'Circular.xls'.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred earlier in the attack sequence, specifically involving an Excel document containing an executable executed by macros.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. It is not typically associated with the initial delivery of a malicious Excel document.
- **T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification**: This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to gain access or maintain persistence. While it could be part of the attack, it is not typically the initial step involving an Excel document.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending malicious emails or messages to trick users into opening or executing malicious content, such as an Excel document with a macro. This is a common initial vector for delivering malware.
- **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**: This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualized environments or sandboxes. It is not typically the initial step in an attack sequence involving an Excel document.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Delivery**: The attack sequence starts with the delivery of a malicious Excel document. This is a common method used in phishing attacks.
2. **User Interaction**: The user is tricked into opening the Excel document and enabling macros.
3. **Macro Execution**: The macro in the Excel document executes, leading to the execution of an embedded executable.
4. **Persistence Establishment**: The 'yty' framework then establishes persistence through a secondary macro in the Excel document.

Given the sequence described, the most likely initial technique is **T1566-Phishing**.

### Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
