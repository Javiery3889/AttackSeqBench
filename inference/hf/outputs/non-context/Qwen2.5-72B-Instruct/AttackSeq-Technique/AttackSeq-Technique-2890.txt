### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries used `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` for thread context manipulation to discover process and thread information.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred after this thread context manipulation but before the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C2) communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1087-Account Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries attempting to identify active user accounts, which is typically done to understand the environment and potentially escalate privileges. However, this does not directly follow from thread context manipulation and is not a necessary step before C2 communication.
- **T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves adversaries querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations. This could be a logical step after discovering process and thread information, as it helps in further reconnaissance and understanding the system.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using common network protocols like HTTP and HTTPS for C2 communication. This is explicitly mentioned as occurring after the sequence we are trying to determine.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Thread Context Manipulation**: The adversaries used `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to discover process and thread information.
2. **Reconnaissance**: After gaining this information, the next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about the system to plan further actions.
3. **Query Registry**: Querying the registry (T1012) is a common reconnaissance technique that fits well between thread context manipulation and C2 communication.
4. **C2 Communication**: Finally, the adversaries use HTTP and HTTPS protocols (T1071) to communicate with their C2 server.

### Final Answer: B: T1012-Query Registry
