### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Initial Access is gained through a Drive-by Compromise.
2. Users are redirected via malvertising or compromised websites.
3. An obfuscated PowerShell script is executed to fetch malware.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
  - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute arbitrary commands when PowerShell is launched. While this can be used for persistence, it is not typically the first step in executing an obfuscated script to fetch malware immediately after gaining initial access.

- **B: T1053.003-Cron**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using cron jobs, which is more relevant to Unix-based systems. It is not typically used in the context of a Windows environment where PowerShell is the primary scripting language.

- **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves acquiring tools or capabilities to support the attack. While it is a part of the attack lifecycle, it does not directly describe the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a common scripting interpreter used in Windows environments, and it is often used to execute obfuscated scripts to fetch and run malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access through a Drive-by Compromise, redirecting users to a malicious site.
2. **Execution of Obfuscated Script**: Once the user is redirected, an obfuscated PowerShell script is executed to fetch malware.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that best describes the execution of a PowerShell script is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
