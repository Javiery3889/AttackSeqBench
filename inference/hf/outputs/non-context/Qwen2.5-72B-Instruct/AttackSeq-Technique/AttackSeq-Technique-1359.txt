### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a first stage downloader saves a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" and later retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
   - The initial access is gained through a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains access through a compromised website.
   - **First Stage Downloader:** A file is saved at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe."
   - **Second Stage Payload:** The downloader retrieves a second stage PlugX file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**

   - **A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails through a service like social media or webmail. It does not align with the scenario of a compromised website.

   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While it could be used in the attack, it does not describe the initial access method.

   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server, often using cloud services. It does not fit the scenario of a compromised website.

   - **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This aligns perfectly with the scenario where the adversary gains access through a compromised website spoofing a legitimate organization.

### Final Reasoning

- The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the adversary using a compromised website to deliver the initial downloader, which then retrieves the second stage PlugX file.
- The technique that best describes the initial access method is T1189-Drive-by Compromise.

### Final Answer

Final Answer: D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
