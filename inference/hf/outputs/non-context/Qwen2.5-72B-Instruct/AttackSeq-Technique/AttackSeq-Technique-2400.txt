### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware:
1. **Process Hollowing** for defense evasion.
2. **Evading detection** while executing the second-stage payload.
3. **Collecting information about active processes** on the infected host.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions**
  - This technique involves adding a new delegate to an email account, which is not related to collecting information about active processes on the infected host. This is more relevant to email-based attacks and persistence.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While this is a common technique for evading detection, it does not directly relate to collecting information about active processes.

- **C: T1012-Query Registry**
  - This technique involves querying the Windows Registry to gather information. While this can be used to gather system information, it is not specifically about collecting information about active processes.

- **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves collecting information about active processes on the infected host. This directly aligns with the described sequence where the malware is collecting information about active processes.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Process Hollowing** is used for defense evasion.
2. **Evading detection** while executing the second-stage payload.
3. **Collecting information about active processes** on the infected host.

The most plausible technique that fits the third step in the sequence is **T1057-Process Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery**
