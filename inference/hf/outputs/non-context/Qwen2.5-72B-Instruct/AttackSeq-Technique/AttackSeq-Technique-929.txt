### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat group Volatile Cedar:
1. Exploitation of server vulnerabilities.
2. Injection of web shell code.
3. Use of compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the group used compromised web servers for gaining initial access to internal networks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware or gain access to systems. It is not typically used in the context of web server exploitation and initial access.

- **B: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities in systems and networks. It is a common pre-exploitation activity where attackers identify potential targets and vulnerabilities before launching an attack.

- **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is more relevant to post-exploitation activities where attackers gather sensitive information.

- **D: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**
  - This sub-technique involves using wordlists to perform brute-force or password spraying attacks. While it can be used to gain initial access, it is more specific to password-based attacks and not typically associated with web server vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exploitation of Server Vulnerabilities**: This suggests that the attackers have already identified vulnerabilities in the web servers.
2. **Injection of Web Shell Code**: This is a common post-exploitation technique where attackers inject malicious code to maintain control over the compromised server.
3. **Use of Compromised Web Servers for Initial Access**: This indicates that the attackers are using the compromised web servers to gain deeper access into the internal network.

Given this sequence, the most logical step before the attackers used the compromised web servers for initial access would be to identify and scan for vulnerabilities. This aligns with the **T1595-Active Scanning** technique.

### Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning
