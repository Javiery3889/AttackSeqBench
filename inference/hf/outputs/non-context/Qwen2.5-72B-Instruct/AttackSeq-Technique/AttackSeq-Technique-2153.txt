### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe` to extract payload components, installing them to a specified directory, and then setting keylogger drivers and malware configuration in the registry keys for persistence. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before these actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious code. While it could be used to deploy malware, it doesn't fit the context of the sequence described, which involves a specific executable (`EhStorAuthn.exe`) and registry modifications.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves tricking users into opening malicious attachments or links, which can lead to the initial compromise. However, the question already assumes that the malware is executing and setting up persistence, which suggests that the initial compromise has already occurred.

- **C: T1137.005-Outlook Rules**
  - This sub-technique involves creating or modifying Outlook rules to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it doesn't fit the context of the sequence described, which involves a specific executable and registry modifications.

- **D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
  - This technique involves modifying Office application startup settings to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible method for the initial execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe` before it sets up persistence in the registry.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence described involves the execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe`, which extracts payload components and installs them.
2. After installation, the malware sets keylogger drivers and malware configuration in the registry keys for persistence.
3. The initial execution of `EhStorAuthn.exe` could be triggered by a method that ensures the malware runs when the user opens an Office application.
4. Among the given choices, T1137-Office Application Startup is the most plausible technique that could have occurred before the described sequence of actions.

**Final Answer: D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
