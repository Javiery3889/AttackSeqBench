### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor BRONZE PRESIDENT to minimize detection. Specifically, the actions include:
- Deleting volume shadow copies
- Terminating processes post-execution

These actions are aimed at avoiding detection and erasing traces of the attack.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs:

- **A: T1564.010 - Process Argument Spoofing**
  - This technique involves modifying the arguments passed to a process to make it appear benign or to bypass security mechanisms. While this can be used to avoid detection, it is not directly related to the actions of deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.

- **B: T1553.001 - Gatekeeper Bypass**
  - This technique involves bypassing the Gatekeeper security feature on macOS to execute unsigned or untrusted applications. This is not relevant to the described actions of deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.

- **C: T1598 - Phishing for Information**
  - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information through phishing attacks. This is not related to the post-execution actions of deleting volume shadow copies or terminating processes.

- **D: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to avoid detection. This includes actions such as deleting logs, clearing the event viewer, and removing files. Deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes are specific actions that fall under the broader category of indicator removal.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The actions described in the question (deleting volume shadow copies and terminating processes) are aimed at removing indicators of the attack.
  - These actions align with the T1070 - Indicator Removal technique, which encompasses various methods to erase traces of the attack.
  - The other answer choices (A, B, and C) do not directly relate to the post-execution actions described in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
