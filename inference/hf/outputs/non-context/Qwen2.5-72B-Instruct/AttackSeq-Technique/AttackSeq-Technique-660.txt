### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker. The sequence is as follows:
1. Initial access via spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office documents that leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol.
2. The attacker then uses living off the land (LotL) tactics.
3. The attacker removes tools from victim machines to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil**
  - **Description**: InstallUtil is a .NET Framework utility that can be used to execute arbitrary code. This technique is often used for persistence and execution.
  - **Relevance**: While InstallUtil can be used after initial access, it is not typically associated with the removal of tools or avoiding detection. It is more focused on execution and persistence.

- **B: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating fake web credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts.
  - **Relevance**: Forging web credentials is not directly related to the removal of tools or avoiding detection. It is more about gaining access to additional systems or accounts.

- **C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
  - **Description**: This technique involves physically removing data from a network, such as using USB drives or other physical storage devices.
  - **Relevance**: Exfiltration over a physical medium is not related to the removal of tools or avoiding detection. It is more about data exfiltration.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - **Description**: This technique involves removing or altering system artifacts to avoid detection. This can include clearing logs, deleting files, and other actions to cover the attacker's tracks.
  - **Relevance**: Indicator removal is directly related to the removal of tools and avoiding detection. It fits well with the described sequence where the attacker uses LotL tactics and then removes tools to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails with malicious Office documents using the DDE protocol.
2. The attacker then uses living off the land (LotL) tactics, which involve using legitimate system tools to perform malicious actions.
3. To avoid detection, the attacker removes tools from the victim machines.

Among the given choices, **T1070-Indicator Removal** is the most relevant technique that aligns with the described sequence of actions, particularly the step where the attacker removes tools to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
