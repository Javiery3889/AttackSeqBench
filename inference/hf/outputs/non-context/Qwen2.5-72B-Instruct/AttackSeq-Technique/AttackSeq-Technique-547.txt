### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where threat actors compromised over twenty high-profile websites to inject JavaScript code that loaded additional malicious code from their C&C servers. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this compromise.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to use it for malicious purposes. This could include compromising websites to inject malicious code, which aligns well with the scenario described.

- **B: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
  - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to monitor or manipulate it. While this could be part of a broader attack, it is not typically a precursor to compromising websites and injecting JavaScript.

- **C: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates**
  - This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malicious code, making it appear legitimate. While this could be used to distribute malware, it is not directly related to the initial compromise of websites.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands on a system. While this could be used to inject JavaScript, it is more of an execution step rather than a precursor to the compromise.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Compromise**: The threat actors need to gain control over the high-profile websites to inject JavaScript.
2. **Injection of JavaScript**: Once the websites are compromised, the threat actors inject JavaScript code.
3. **Loading Malicious Code**: The injected JavaScript code loads additional malicious code from the C&C servers.

The most logical precursor to the compromise of the websites is the compromise of the infrastructure itself, which is described by T1584-Compromise Infrastructure.

**Final Answer: A: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
