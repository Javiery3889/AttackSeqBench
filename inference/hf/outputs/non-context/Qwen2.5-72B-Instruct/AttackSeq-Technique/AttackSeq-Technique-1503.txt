### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Iron group:
1. They deployed a backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
2. The installer checked for VM execution.
3. The installer dropped a backdoor DLL.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. While this could be used to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of checking for VM execution and dropping a backdoor DLL.

- **B: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - This technique involves deploying a container, which is not typically part of the initial stages of deploying a backdoor. It is more relevant to cloud and containerized environments, which is not mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. After dropping a backdoor DLL, it is plausible that the attacker would use this technique to ensure the backdoor is executed at system startup or on a regular basis.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, or other artifacts to avoid detection. After dropping a backdoor DLL, it is also plausible that the attacker would use this technique to hide the backdoor and other related files.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Actions:**
   - The Iron group deployed a backdoor using HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.
   - The installer checked for VM execution to avoid analysis.
   - The installer dropped a backdoor DLL.

2. **Next Logical Step:**
   - After dropping the backdoor DLL, the attacker would likely want to ensure the backdoor is executed and remains undetected.
   - **T1569-System Services** is a logical next step because it ensures the backdoor is executed at system startup or on a regular basis, providing persistence.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts** is also a logical step to avoid detection, but it is more about hiding the backdoor rather than ensuring its execution.

Given the context, **T1569-System Services** is the most plausible next step after dropping the backdoor DLL.

### Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services
