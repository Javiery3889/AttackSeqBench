### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is obtained through phishing messages on platforms like Instagram or Telegram. The attackers then secure the victims' Instagram usernames and passwords to lock them out of their accounts.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Initial access through phishing messages.
  - Securing victims' Instagram usernames and passwords.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
  - **Description**: This technique involves planting a list of processes or services to be executed or monitored.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the process of securing usernames and passwords. It is more about manipulating process lists, which does not fit the context of the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to obtain sensitive information like passwords.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant because it directly involves capturing the victims' Instagram usernames and passwords, which is a crucial step in the attack sequence described.

- **Answer Choice C: T1110.002-Password Cracking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using tools to crack passwords.
  - **Relevance**: While password cracking could be used to gain access to accounts, the question specifically mentions that the attackers secured the usernames and passwords, which suggests they were directly captured rather than cracked.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system or account.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is relevant to the initial access phase, but the question asks about the technique that occurred **before** securing the victims' Instagram usernames and passwords. Phishing is the initial step, not the step that directly leads to securing the credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use phishing messages on platforms like Instagram or Telegram to gain initial access.
2. **Securing Credentials**: After gaining initial access, the attackers need to capture the victims' Instagram usernames and passwords to lock them out of their accounts.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that directly involves capturing the victims' credentials is **T1056-Input Capture**.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
