### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack. The sequence involves:
1. Using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information (reconnaissance).
2. Leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1059.002-AppleScript**
  - This technique involves using AppleScript to execute arbitrary code. It is not directly related to the reconnaissance or credential harvesting described in the question.

- **B: T1558.002-Silver Ticket**
  - This technique involves creating and using Kerberos service tickets to authenticate to a service. It is more related to post-exploitation and maintaining access rather than the initial stages of reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

- **C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network topology. While this is a form of reconnaissance, it is more focused on network information rather than personal contact information.

- **D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
  - This technique involves creating fake web pages or forms to trick users into entering their credentials. This aligns well with the described use of HTTPS landing pages to mimic legitimate password recovery or reset emails.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack starts with using social media mobile apps to steal personal contact information, which is part of the reconnaissance phase.
2. The next step involves leveraging HTTPS landing pages to harvest credentials via mimicry of legitimate password recovery or reset emails.
3. Among the given choices, **T1606-Forge Web Credentials** is the most relevant technique for creating fake web pages to trick users into entering their credentials.

**Final Answer: D: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
