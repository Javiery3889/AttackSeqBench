### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where additional C2 (Command and Control) domains were identified through pivoting on Googlebot-like user agent strings.
   - The initial C2 domain is mentioned as `judystevenson[.]info`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to establish communication with this initial C2 domain.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1001.001-Junk Data**
     - This technique involves adding junk data to the payload to obfuscate the content. It is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
     - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. It is more about reconnaissance and not about establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a plausible technique for establishing communication with a C2 domain.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. While phishing can be used to initially compromise a system, it is not directly about establishing communication with a C2 server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question is asking about the technique used to establish communication with the initial C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info`.
   - Establishing communication with a C2 server typically involves using standard application layer protocols to send and receive data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible technique is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
