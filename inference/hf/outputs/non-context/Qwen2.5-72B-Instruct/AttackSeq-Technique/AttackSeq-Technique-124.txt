### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Agrius used wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD for destructive actions.
   - After these actions, Agrius used the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP for coordinating further actions.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**
     - This technique involves using the .NET Framework's `regsvcs.exe` or `regasm.exe` to load and register .NET assemblies. This is typically used for persistence or privilege escalation, not for communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**
     - This technique involves overwhelming a service with requests to cause a denial of service. This is not related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
     - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, which is a form of data destruction. This is not related to communication with C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1021-Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to execute commands on a remote system. This is a plausible technique for coordinating further actions after establishing communication with C2 servers.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question involves using wipers for destructive actions and then using a backdoor to communicate with C2 servers.
   - After establishing communication with C2 servers, the next logical step would be to use remote services to execute further commands or actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that would occur after the communication with C2 servers is T1021-Remote Services.

**Final Answer: D: T1021-Remote Services**
