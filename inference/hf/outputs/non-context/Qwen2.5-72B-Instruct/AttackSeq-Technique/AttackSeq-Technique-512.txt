### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved persistence using the `HKCU` autorun system registry keys `Run` and `RunOnce`.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves transmitting encrypted and compressed JSON configuration data via HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, such as network topology, employee details, and organizational structure. It is not related to maintaining C2 communication.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. The question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests, which aligns with this technique.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for standard network communication, such as raw sockets or custom protocols. The question mentions HTTP, which is an application layer protocol, so this choice does not fit.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon, which is how the attacker achieved persistence. However, the question is asking about the next step, which is maintaining C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has already achieved persistence using the `HKCU` autorun system registry keys `Run` and `RunOnce`.
- The next step involves transmitting data to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
- HTTP is an application layer protocol, and the question specifically mentions the use of HTTP POST requests to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is the one that involves using an application layer protocol to communicate with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
