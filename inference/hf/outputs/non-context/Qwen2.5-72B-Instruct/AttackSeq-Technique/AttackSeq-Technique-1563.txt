### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question is about the SolarWinds incident, which is a well-known supply chain attack.
- **Key Information**: The backdoor used has overlapping features with Kazuar, and the question asks about the technique that most likely occurred prior to establishing command and control.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. While this could be used for command and control, it is not typically a pre-requisite for establishing command and control. It is more of a method used after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access to a target system. While spearphishing is a common initial access vector, the SolarWinds incident did not primarily rely on spearphishing. It was a supply chain attack.

- **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization. The SolarWinds incident is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where the attackers compromised the SolarWinds software update process to distribute malware to their victims.

- **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. While this could be used for persistence or to execute commands at specific times, it is not a typical initial access vector and does not align with the context of the SolarWinds incident.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The SolarWinds incident is known for its supply chain compromise, where the attackers injected malicious code into the SolarWinds software updates.
  - Establishing command and control using a backdoor with features similar to Kazuar would logically follow after gaining initial access through the supply chain compromise.
  - The other techniques (T1071, T1566.001, and T1053.006) do not align as closely with the initial access method used in the SolarWinds incident.

**Final Answer: C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
