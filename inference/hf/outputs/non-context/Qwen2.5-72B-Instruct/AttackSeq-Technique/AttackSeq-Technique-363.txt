### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FIN8.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a script (mimi.ps1) suspected to be Mimikatz to read the memory of lsass.exe for credential dumping.
     - Conducting system fingerprinting with commands such as `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs is:
     1. Credential Dumping (using Mimikatz to read lsass.exe memory).
     2. System Fingerprinting (using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1055.014-VDSO Hijacking:**
     - VDSO Hijacking is a technique used to manipulate the Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (VDSO) to execute arbitrary code. This technique is not typically used for credential dumping or system fingerprinting.
   - **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping:**
     - OS Credential Dumping involves extracting credentials from the operating system. This aligns with the use of Mimikatz to read the memory of lsass.exe for credential dumping.
   - **C: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery:**
     - System Network Connections Discovery involves identifying active network connections. This is more related to network reconnaissance and is not directly related to credential dumping or system fingerprinting.
   - **D: T1555.001-Keychain:**
     - Keychain is a technique used to extract credentials from the macOS Keychain. This is specific to macOS and not relevant to the Windows environment described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question starts with credential dumping using Mimikatz.
   - The next step is system fingerprinting using commands like `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`.
   - The technique that aligns with the credential dumping step is T1003-OS Credential Dumping.
   - The other techniques (VDSO Hijacking, System Network Connections Discovery, and Keychain) do not fit the described sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping
