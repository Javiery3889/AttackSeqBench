### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access using exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with Sakula malware.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the adversary establishing connections to C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure at `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with Sakula malware.
   - **C2 Communication:** Establishing connections to C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers. This is a plausible choice because it describes the method of communication used to establish connections to the C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves methods to hide the infrastructure used for C2 communication. While this could be relevant, it is not the primary technique used to establish the initial connection.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a victim's system through a web application. This is not relevant to the C2 communication step.
   - **D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
     - This sub-technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for C2 communication. While it is a specific method of communication, it is not the most general or likely choice for establishing C2 connections in this context.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible technique for establishing connections to C2 infrastructure is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique is broad and encompasses various methods of communication that an adversary might use to maintain control over the infected system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
