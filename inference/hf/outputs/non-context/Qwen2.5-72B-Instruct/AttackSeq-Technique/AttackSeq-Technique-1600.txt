### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The attack sequence involves FastPOS using keylogging and RAM scraping to steal information.
- **Tactic in Focus**: Collection
- **Objective**: Determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that follows keylogging and RAM scraping before the stolen credit card information is transmitted to the attacker.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1057 - Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying running processes, which is typically used for reconnaissance or to understand the environment. It is not directly related to the collection of stolen information.
- **T1115 - Clipboard Data**: This technique involves capturing data from the clipboard, which is not typically used in the context of stealing credit card information from RAM or keylogging.
- **T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is more related to credential theft rather than the collection of already stolen credit card information.
- **T1056 - Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keylogging. Since keylogging is already mentioned in the attack sequence, this technique is less likely to be the next step. However, it is part of the Collection tactic and can be used to capture additional input if needed.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Keylogging and RAM Scraping**: These techniques are used to steal credit card information directly from user input and memory.
2. **Collection Tactic**: The next step in the Collection tactic would be to ensure that the stolen information is ready for exfiltration.
3. **Clipboard Data (T1115)**: This technique is not relevant to the collection of credit card information from RAM or keylogging.
4. **Process Discovery (T1057)**: This technique is more about reconnaissance and understanding the environment, not directly related to the collection of stolen information.
5. **Credentials from Password Stores (T1555)**: This technique is more about stealing credentials, which is not the focus of the current attack sequence.
6. **Input Capture (T1056)**: While keylogging is already part of the attack, this technique can be used to capture additional user input if needed, but it is not the most likely next step in the sequence.

Given the context, the most plausible next step in the Collection tactic after keylogging and RAM scraping would be to ensure the stolen information is ready for exfiltration. However, since the question asks for the most likely technique under the Collection tactic, and keylogging is already mentioned, the most relevant and plausible choice is:

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
