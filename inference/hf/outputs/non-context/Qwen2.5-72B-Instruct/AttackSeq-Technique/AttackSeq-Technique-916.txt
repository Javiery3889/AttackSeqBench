### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Tuyul malware executed Perl scripts and shell commands to operate on victim systems after exploiting a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841)?
- **Key Points**:
  - Tuyul malware executed Perl scripts and shell commands.
  - The exploitation of a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) occurred.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. This is relevant to the execution of Perl scripts and shell commands.
  - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with systems. This is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the exploitation of a vulnerability.
  - **C: T1587.004-Exploits**: This technique involves the use of exploits to gain initial access or elevate privileges. This is relevant to the exploitation of the PHPUnit vulnerability (CVE-2017-9841).
  - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**: This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. This is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the exploitation of a vulnerability.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exploitation of the Vulnerability**:
   - The question states that the vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) was exploited. This is a clear indication of the use of an exploit.
   - The technique **T1587.004-Exploits** aligns with this step.

2. **Execution of Perl Scripts and Shell Commands**:
   - After the vulnerability is exploited, the malware executes Perl scripts and shell commands.
   - The technique **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** aligns with this step.

3. **Sequence of Events**:
   - The exploitation of the vulnerability (T1587.004) must occur before the execution of scripts and commands (T1059).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1587.004-Exploits
