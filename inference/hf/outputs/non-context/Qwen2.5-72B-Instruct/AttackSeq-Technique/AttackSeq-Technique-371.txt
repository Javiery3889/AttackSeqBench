### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor group FIN8. They used BADHATCH to conduct system fingerprinting and discover the Domain Controller using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
- **Objective**: Determine the ATT&CK technique used to transfer the deployment script to the Domain Controller for execution.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - **Description**: Lateral Tool Transfer involves copying tools or files from one system to another within a network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique fits the scenario where the deployment script needs to be transferred to the Domain Controller for execution.

- **Answer Choice B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - **Description**: Reversible Encryption involves using encryption to protect credentials or data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the transfer of a deployment script. It is more about protecting data rather than moving it.

- **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - **Description**: System Network Configuration Discovery involves gathering information about the network configuration of a system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique was already used in the initial phase to discover the Domain Controller. It does not describe the transfer of a script.

- **Answer Choice D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - **Description**: SSH Hijacking involves taking over an existing SSH session.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the transfer of a deployment script. It is more about gaining control over an existing session.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Actions**: FIN8 used BADHATCH to conduct system fingerprinting and discover the Domain Controller using `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`. This aligns with the System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016) technique.
2. **Objective**: The next step is to transfer the deployment script to the Domain Controller for execution.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that best fits the transfer of a script from one system to another within the network is Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570).

**Final Answer: A: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
