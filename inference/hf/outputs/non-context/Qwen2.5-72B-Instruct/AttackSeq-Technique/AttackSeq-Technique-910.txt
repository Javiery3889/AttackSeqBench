### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The attacker gained initial access via spear-phishing emails that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word documents.
- **Next Step**: An .EXE file packed with UPX was dropped to the %System% folder.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1564.010 - Process Argument Spoofing**
  - This technique involves modifying the arguments passed to a process to hide malicious activity. While this can be used to evade detection, it is not typically the next logical step after dropping an .EXE file to the system folder.

- **Answer Choice B: T1600 - Weaken Encryption**
  - This technique involves weakening or bypassing encryption to gain access to sensitive data. This is not directly related to the sequence of dropping an .EXE file and ensuring it runs at boot or logon.

- **Answer Choice C: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the dropped .EXE file runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common next step after dropping a malicious file to ensure persistence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1053.006 - Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. Since the question mentions the %System% folder, which is a Windows directory, this technique is not relevant.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker used spear-phishing emails to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word documents.
2. **Dropping the .EXE File**: The attacker then dropped an .EXE file packed with UPX to the %System% folder.
3. **Next Logical Step**: To ensure the .EXE file runs automatically, the attacker would likely use a technique to achieve persistence, such as setting up a boot or logon autostart execution.

**Final Answer: C: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
