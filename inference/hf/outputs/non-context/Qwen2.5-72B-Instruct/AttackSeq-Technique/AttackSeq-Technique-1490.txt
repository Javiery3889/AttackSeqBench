### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where Babar:
1. Captures data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
2. Initiates communication with its C&C servers through remote thread injection.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Babar to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1056.001 - Keylogging**
  - Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes from a user. While this can capture data, it is specific to keystrokes and not necessarily data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.

- **B: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. It is not related to capturing data from desktop applications.

- **C: T1113 - Screen Capture**
  - Screen capture involves capturing the contents of the screen. This can capture data from desktop applications, but it is not specific to using global Windows hooks.

- **D: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. It is not related to capturing data from desktop applications.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** Identify the need to capture data from desktop applications using global Windows hooks.
- **Step 2:** Evaluate the techniques:
  - **Keylogging (T1056.001)**: Captures keystrokes, not data from applications.
  - **Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)**: Exfiltrates data, not captures it.
  - **Screen Capture (T1113)**: Captures screen content, which can include data from applications.
  - **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**: Executes commands, not captures data.
- **Step 3:** Determine the most plausible technique:
  - **Screen Capture (T1113)** is the most plausible technique because it can capture data from desktop applications, which aligns with the use of global Windows hooks.

### Final Answer: C: T1113 - Screen Capture
