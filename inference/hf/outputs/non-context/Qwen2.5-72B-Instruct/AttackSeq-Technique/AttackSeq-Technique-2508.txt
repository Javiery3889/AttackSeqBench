### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have gained remote access to hotel front desks and have already stolen credit card details. The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting additional data by monitoring OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites and hotel personnel activities.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. While this could be used to steal credit card details, it is not specifically about monitoring activities on websites or personnel.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information through deceptive emails or messages. While phishing can be used to gain initial access, it is not about monitoring activities on websites or personnel.

- **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from various information repositories, such as databases, file shares, and other data storage systems. This could be relevant if the attackers are looking to gather additional data from internal systems, but it does not specifically address monitoring activities on websites or personnel.

- **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. This is not about monitoring activities on websites or personnel.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already gained remote access and stolen credit card details.
- The next step involves monitoring activities on OTA websites and hotel personnel.
- **T1056-Input Capture** and **T1566-Phishing** are not relevant to monitoring activities.
- **T1072-Software Deployment Tools** is about deploying malicious software, not monitoring.
- **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** is the most plausible choice because it involves collecting data from various sources, which could include monitoring activities on websites and personnel.

**Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
