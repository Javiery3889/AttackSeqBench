### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the OceanLotus group. The sequence is as follows:
1. Decrypted and loaded additional data using DLL Side-Loading.
2. Executed shellcode extracted from resource data for persistence.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is typically used for data exfiltration or command execution, not for persistence or loading additional data.

- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, file extensions, or other artifacts to avoid detection. While this could be used to hide the additional data or the shellcode, it is not a necessary step between loading the data and executing the shellcode for persistence.

- **C: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
  - This technique involves modifying the KernelCallbackTable to gain persistence. This is a more advanced and specific method of persistence, but it is not typically used in the context of loading additional data and then executing shellcode.

- **D: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process. This is a common method used to execute shellcode or other malicious payloads. It fits well between loading the additional data and executing the shellcode for persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **DLL Side-Loading**: The attacker decrypts and loads additional data using DLL Side-Loading.
2. **Portable Executable Injection (T1055.002)**: The attacker injects the shellcode into a running process to execute it.
3. **Execution of Shellcode for Persistence**: The shellcode is executed to establish persistence.

The most plausible sequence is that the attacker used Portable Executable Injection to execute the shellcode after loading the additional data and before establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
