### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions where BlueDelta exploited Roundcube webmail software for reconnaissance and then dumped OS credentials like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` from the compromised systems.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Exploitation of Roundcube webmail software.
  - Dumping OS credentials (`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`).
  - Gathering system, network configuration, and owner/user information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access**
  - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to credentials. While this is relevant to the initial exploitation of Roundcube, it does not directly align with the step of gathering system, network configuration, and owner/user information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying the system's owner and user information. This is a logical step after gaining access to the system and before gathering more detailed information about the system and network configuration.

- **Answer Choice C: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying email rules to hide or redirect emails. This is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration. This is a logical step after gaining access to the system and before or after identifying the system's owner and user information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Exploitation**: BlueDelta exploited Roundcube webmail software to gain initial access.
2. **Credential Dumping**: After gaining access, BlueDelta dumped OS credentials (`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`).
3. **System and Network Information Gathering**: The next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about the system and network configuration to understand the environment better.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible technique that occurred before gathering system, network configuration, and owner/user information is **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**. This step helps the attacker understand who is using the system, which is crucial before gathering more detailed information.

**Final Answer: B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
