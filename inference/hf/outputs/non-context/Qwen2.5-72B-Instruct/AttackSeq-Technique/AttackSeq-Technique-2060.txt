### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an organized criminal group gains initial access through targeted emailing and infections from other botnets. After gaining access, they use tools like Mimikatz and Anunak malware to carry out attacks on banks and payment systems.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Initial access through targeted emailing and infections from other botnets.
  - Use of tools like Mimikatz and Anunak malware.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: Compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is not mentioned in the question. The initial access is described as being gained through targeted emailing and infections from other botnets, not through a supply chain compromise.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: Using phishing techniques to gain initial access to a target.
  - **Evaluation**: This aligns well with the initial access method described in the question, which involves targeted emailing. Phishing is a common method for delivering malware and gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - **Description**: Extracting credentials from the operating system.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is relevant to the use of tools like Mimikatz, which is known for credential dumping. However, it is more likely to occur after gaining initial access, not before.

- **Answer Choice D: T1498.001-Direct Network Flood**
  - **Description**: Flooding the network to cause a denial of service.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is not mentioned in the question and does not align with the described attack sequence, which focuses on gaining initial access and using specific tools for credential dumping and malware deployment.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access was gained through targeted emailing and infections from other botnets.
2. **Phishing**: Phishing (T1566) is a common method for delivering malware and gaining initial access through targeted emails.
3. **Post-Access Activities**: After gaining access, the group uses tools like Mimikatz and Anunak malware, which align with techniques like OS Credential Dumping (T1003) and other post-access activities.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
