### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Shellbot has already discovered monitoring tools and host information.
   - The next step in the sequence is to establish persistent communication with the C&C servers via IRC.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique logically fits between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1518-Software Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering software installed on a system. However, the question already states that monitoring tools and host information have been discovered, so this step is likely already completed.
   - **B: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities on the target system. While this could be a part of the attack, it is typically done earlier in the attack lifecycle to identify potential entry points, not after initial reconnaissance.
   - **C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering network services and their configurations. This step is logical after initial reconnaissance and before establishing communication with the C&C server, as the attacker would need to understand the network environment to set up communication.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While this is a common step in the attack lifecycle, it is typically done to maintain stealth and is not necessarily a prerequisite for establishing C&C communication.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attacker has already gathered initial information about the host and is preparing to establish communication with the C&C server.
   - Discovering network services (T1046) is a logical next step because it helps the attacker understand the network environment and identify the best way to establish and maintain communication.
   - The other techniques (T1518, T1595.002, and T1564) do not fit as well into this specific sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
