### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The infection sequence involves two steps:
  1. `sysOptimizer.bat` collects personal files.
  2. `sysCrt32.exe` initializes execution components.
- **Objective**: Determine the ATT&CK technique used to transfer collected data securely to FTP servers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of automated mechanisms to exfiltrate data from a target network.
  - **Relevance**: This is a strong candidate because it directly involves the automated transfer of data, which aligns with the described sequence of collecting and transferring data to FTP servers.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific times.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for maintaining persistence and ensuring that malicious activities are performed at specific intervals, it does not directly address the transfer of data to FTP servers.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the discovery of credentials stored in files.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about discovering and using credentials, not about transferring data. It does not fit the context of the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the exfiltration of data to text storage sites, such as pastebin or other online text storage services.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to exfiltrating data to text storage sites, not to FTP servers. Therefore, it does not align with the described sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Key Steps**: The sequence involves collecting personal files and then transferring them to FTP servers.
2. **Evaluate the Techniques**:
   - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most relevant because it directly involves the automated transfer of data, which fits the described sequence.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is about scheduling tasks, not transferring data.
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files** is about discovering credentials, not transferring data.
   - **T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites** is about exfiltrating data to text storage sites, not FTP servers.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
