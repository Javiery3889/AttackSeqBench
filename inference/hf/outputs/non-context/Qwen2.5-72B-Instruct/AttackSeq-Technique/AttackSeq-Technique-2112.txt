### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before exfiltrating data through the established C&C channel to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives.
   - The key elements are:
     - Gathering screenshots
     - Surveillance objectives
     - Before exfiltration

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**
     - This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system, which is not related to gathering screenshots or surveillance.
   - **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves network poisoning and relay attacks, which are used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to gathering screenshots.
   - **C: T1555.002-Securityd Memory**
     - This technique involves extracting credentials from the memory of the `securityd` process, which is specific to macOS. It is not related to gathering screenshots.
   - **D: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing screenshots of the victim's screen, which is directly related to gathering screenshots and surveillance.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks for the technique used to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives.
   - Among the given choices, only **T1113-Screen Capture** directly aligns with the requirement to gather screenshots.
   - The other techniques (T1529, T1557.001, and T1555.002) do not involve capturing screenshots and are not relevant to the surveillance objective mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
