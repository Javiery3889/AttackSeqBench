### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Regin malware utilized encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial evasion technique.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating or encrypting files and information to avoid detection. While this is a common evasion technique, the question already mentions that Regin used encrypted data blobs, which is a form of obfuscation. Therefore, this technique is less likely to be the next step in the sequence.

- **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the way programs are loaded to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible next step after evading detection, as the malware might need to ensure it can run without being detected or interrupted.

- **C: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing screenshots or video feeds from a victim's display. While this is a common post-compromise technique, it is not directly related to the initial evasion technique described. It is less likely to be the immediate next step.

- **D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection. This is a common post-evasion technique, as it allows the malware to run in the context of a trusted process, making it harder to detect.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Evasion**: Regin uses encrypted data blobs stored in non-traditional file storage areas to evade detection.
2. **Next Step**: After successfully evading detection, the malware would likely need to ensure it can execute its payload without being detected.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Already used in the initial evasion.
   - **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**: Plausible, but less specific to the context of running in a trusted process.
   - **T1113-Screen Capture**: Not directly related to the initial evasion.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: Most plausible, as it allows the malware to run in a trusted process, maintaining stealth.

### Final Answer: D: T1055.012-Process Hollowing
