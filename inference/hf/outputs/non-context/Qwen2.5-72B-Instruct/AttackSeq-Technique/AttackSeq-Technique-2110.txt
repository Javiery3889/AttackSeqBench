### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that would most likely be used to gather detailed victim system information, including hostname, OS details, and anti-virus data, before the attackers execute multi-stage shellcode using anti-sandboxing and dynamic API resolving.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1496.003-SMS Pumping**
  - This technique involves sending SMS messages to a victim's phone to gather information or perform actions. It is not relevant to gathering system information on a computer.

- **B: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about installed software on a system. This can include details about the operating system, installed applications, and security software like anti-virus. This aligns well with the requirement to gather detailed victim system information.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves tricking victims into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While it can be used to gain initial access, it is not specifically about gathering detailed system information.

- **D: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering containers and resources in cloud environments. It is not relevant to gathering detailed system information on a local machine.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Relevance to System Information Gathering:**
   - **T1496.003-SMS Pumping** is not relevant to gathering system information.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery** is directly relevant to gathering detailed system information, including OS details and anti-virus data.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is more about initial access and tricking users, not detailed system information.
   - **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery** is specific to cloud environments and not local system information.

2. **Context of the Attack Sequence:**
   - The question mentions that the attackers are preparing to execute multi-stage shellcode with anti-sandboxing and dynamic API resolving. Gathering detailed system information is a crucial step in this preparation to ensure the attack is successful and evades detection.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible technique for gathering detailed victim system information, including hostname, OS details, and anti-virus data, is **T1518-Software Discovery**.

Final Answer: B: T1518-Software Discovery
