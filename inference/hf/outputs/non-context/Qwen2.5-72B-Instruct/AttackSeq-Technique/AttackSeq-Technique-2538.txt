### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware ensures persistence by moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder. After this, the malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Persistence**: Moving malware to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.
  - **C&C Configuration Retrieval**: Retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
  - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information. While it could be used to find C&C servers, it doesn't specifically align with retrieving encrypted configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

- **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C&C servers. This could be relevant if the malware is using web services to retrieve the C&C configuration, but it doesn't specifically mention blogs or microblogs.

- **Answer Choice C: T1588.005-Exploits**
  - This technique involves using exploits to gain access to systems. It is not relevant to the retrieval of C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

- **Answer Choice D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data, which is often used to hide C&C communication. This aligns well with the scenario where the malware retrieves encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The malware ensures persistence by moving to the Windows temp folder and creating shortcut files in the startup folder.
  - The next step is to retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.
  - The most relevant technique for retrieving and handling encrypted information is **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**. This technique is used to obfuscate data, which is consistent with the retrieval of encrypted C&C configuration information.

**Final Answer: D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
