### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Milestone backdoor sent session information to the C2 server over an uncompressed communication channel. The key elements to focus on are:
- The Milestone backdoor
- Sending session information
- Uncompressed communication channel

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1659 - Content Injection**
- Content Injection involves modifying or adding content to a target's data or communications. This technique is typically used to manipulate data or inject malicious content into a communication stream. It is not directly related to the initial setup of a communication channel or the transmission of session information.

**B: T1518 - Software Discovery**
- Software Discovery involves identifying installed software on a system. This technique is used to gather information about the target environment but does not directly relate to the communication of session information to a C2 server.

**C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
- Application Layer Protocol involves using standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This technique is directly related to the communication of session information over an uncompressed channel. It is a logical step that would occur before the actual transmission of data.

**D: T1014 - Rootkit**
- Rootkit involves installing a rootkit to hide the presence of malware or other malicious activities. While this technique can be used to maintain persistence and avoid detection, it is not directly related to the communication of session information to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Content Injection (T1659)**: This technique is not directly related to the communication of session information.
2. **Software Discovery (T1518)**: This technique is used for gathering information but not for communication.
3. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**: This technique is directly related to the communication of session information over a network, making it the most plausible choice.
4. **Rootkit (T1014)**: This technique is used for persistence and hiding but not for communication.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique that would occur before the Milestone backdoor sends session information to the C2 server over an uncompressed communication channel is **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
