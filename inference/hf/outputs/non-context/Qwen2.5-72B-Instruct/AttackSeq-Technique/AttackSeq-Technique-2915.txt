### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker:
1. Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz for privilege escalation.
2. Stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the theft of the VPN certificate.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While this could be relevant, it doesn't specifically align with the use of Mimikatz for privilege escalation.

- **B: T1003.007-Proc Filesystem**
  - This sub-technique involves credential dumping from the process file system. While this is related to credential theft, it is more specific to the method of obtaining credentials rather than the sequence of events leading to the theft of a VPN certificate.

- **C: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
  - This technique involves weakening encryption to gain access to sensitive data. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described in the question.

- **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which directly aligns with the theft of a VPN certificate for remote network access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which is a form of privilege escalation.
2. After gaining these credentials, the next logical step would be to use them to steal a VPN certificate for remote access.
3. The technique that directly aligns with stealing a VPN certificate is T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker used the domain administrator credentials to steal a VPN certificate.

**Final Answer: D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
