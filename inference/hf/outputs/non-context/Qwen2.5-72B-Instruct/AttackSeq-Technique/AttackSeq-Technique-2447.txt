### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elise malware.
   - The malware establishes persistence by modifying the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
   - The malware then communicates with a hardcoded C2 (Command and Control) server to send harvested data and receive commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the Run Registry key to ensure it runs at system startup.
   - **C2 Communication:** The malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server to send data and receive commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves the malware detecting and evading virtualized environments or sandboxes. It does not align with the described communication with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
     - This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions on services. It does not align with the described communication with a C2 server.
   - **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it could be relevant, it is not the most specific or direct match for the described communication with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns well with the described communication to send harvested data and receive commands.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the malware establishing persistence and then using a standard application layer protocol to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns with the description in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
