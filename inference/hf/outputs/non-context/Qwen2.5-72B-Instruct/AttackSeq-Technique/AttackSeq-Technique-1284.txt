### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Tropic Trooper:
1. DLL hijacking to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` via `sidebar.exe`.
2. Creation of a hidden directory in the system.
3. Backdoor DLL injection into the legitimate process `dllhost.exe` for Defense Evasion.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the backdoor DLL was injected into `dllhost.exe`.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not typically a prerequisite for process injection.

- **B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. It is more related to network-level attacks and is not directly related to process injection or DLL hijacking.

- **C: T1055-Process Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process to evade detection. This aligns perfectly with the described action of injecting the backdoor DLL into `dllhost.exe`.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not specifically related to the process injection described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **DLL Hijacking**: The attacker uses DLL hijacking to load the malicious `wab32res.dll` via `sidebar.exe`.
2. **Hidden Directory Creation**: The attacker creates a hidden directory in the system.
3. **Process Injection**: The attacker injects the backdoor DLL into the legitimate process `dllhost.exe` to evade detection.

The technique that most likely occurred before the backdoor DLL was injected into `dllhost.exe` is **Process Injection (T1055)**.

### Final Answer: C: T1055-Process Injection
