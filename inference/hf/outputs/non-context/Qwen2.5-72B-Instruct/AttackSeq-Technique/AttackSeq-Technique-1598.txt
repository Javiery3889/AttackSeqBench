### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where FastPOS infiltrated systems through methods such as links to a compromised site or direct file transfer via VNC. The focus is on the technique that likely occurred before the RAM scraper transmitted stolen credit card information to the attacker.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Infiltration methods: Links to a compromised site or direct file transfer via VNC.
  - RAM scraper: Focused on immediate transmission of stolen credit card information to the attacker.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. While this could be a method of initial compromise, it does not align with the described methods of infiltration (links to a compromised site or direct file transfer via VNC).

- **Answer Choice B: T1552.007-Container API**
  - This technique involves accessing sensitive information from container APIs. This is not relevant to the context of a RAM scraper or the described methods of infiltration.

- **Answer Choice C: T1056.001-Keylogging**
  - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While keylogging can be used to steal information, it is not typically the method used by a RAM scraper, which focuses on capturing data directly from memory.

- **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, which can include keylogging and other methods of capturing data. However, the broader category of input capture is more relevant to the context of a RAM scraper, which captures data from memory (input) and transmits it to the attacker.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attack sequence involves initial infiltration through links to a compromised site or direct file transfer via VNC.
  - After gaining access, the RAM scraper focuses on capturing and transmitting stolen credit card information.
  - The most relevant technique that aligns with the RAM scraper's function of capturing data from memory and transmitting it is T1056-Input Capture.
  - While T1056.001-Keylogging is a specific sub-technique of input capture, the broader category T1056-Input Capture is more appropriate for the described scenario.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
