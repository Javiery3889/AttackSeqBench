### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus Group:
1. **Before** using compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement.
2. **After** using encrypted configuration files for defense evasion.
3. **Which technique** most likely involved the collection of information related to the target's system details?

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices connected to a system, such as printers, USB drives, and other external devices. While this can be useful for gathering information, it is not specifically focused on system details.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that benefit the attacker. Phishing is typically used for initial access and not for collecting system details.

- **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This is directly related to gathering system details, which is what the question is asking for.

- **D: T1087.001-Local Account**
  - This technique involves identifying local user accounts on a system. While this can be useful for lateral movement, it is not specifically focused on collecting system details.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access and Defense Evasion**:
   - The Lazarus Group likely used phishing (T1566) to gain initial access to the target system.
   - They then used encrypted configuration files (T1027) to evade detection.

2. **System Information Discovery**:
   - After gaining access and evading detection, the next logical step would be to gather information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities. This is where T1082-System Information Discovery comes into play.

3. **Lateral Movement**:
   - Once the system details are known, the attackers can then use compromised privileged accounts (T1078) for lateral movement.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique for collecting information related to the target's system details is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
