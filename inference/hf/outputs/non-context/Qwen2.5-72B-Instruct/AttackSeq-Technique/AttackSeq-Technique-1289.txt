### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a macro within a lure document is enabled, and the malicious routine is triggered via `Document_Open()`.
- The next step involves using PowerShell files (like `invoker.ps1`) to execute the final payload.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the stage before persistence was achieved.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
  - This technique involves using a Windows command shell to execute commands. While it is a common method for executing commands, it is not specific to the use of PowerShell scripts.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is a common technique used in malware, it does not directly relate to the execution of PowerShell scripts.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command and scripting interpreters, such as PowerShell, to execute commands and scripts. This is directly relevant to the use of `invoker.ps1` to execute the final payload.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
  - This technique involves using domain generation algorithms to generate a large number of domain names for command and control (C2) communication. This is not relevant to the execution of PowerShell scripts or the initial stages of the attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events involves enabling a macro, triggering a malicious routine, and then using a PowerShell script to execute the final payload.
- The technique that most directly facilitates the execution of the PowerShell script is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.
- This technique is the most plausible because it specifically involves using scripting interpreters like PowerShell to execute commands and scripts, which aligns with the use of `invoker.ps1`.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
