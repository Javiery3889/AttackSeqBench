### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Delphi downloader gathers system information and sends it to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
- The focus is on the technique used to secure communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - Active Scanning involves probing a network to gather information about the target. This technique is used for reconnaissance and does not relate to securing communication.
  - **Not a plausible choice.**

- **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - Encrypted Channel involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the backdoor and the C&C server. This is a common technique to secure communication in malware.
  - **Plausible choice.**

- **Answer Choice C: T1071.004-DNS**
  - DNS (Domain Name System) is a sub-technique of T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). It involves using DNS for communication, but it does not inherently secure the communication.
  - **Not a plausible choice.**

- **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - Hijack Execution Flow involves altering the normal flow of execution to run malicious code. This technique is used to gain control over a system but does not relate to securing communication.
  - **Not a plausible choice.**

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about securing communication between the Delphi backdoor and the C&C server.
- Among the given choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the only technique that directly addresses the need to secure communication.
- The other choices (T1595, T1071.004, and T1574) do not relate to securing communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
