### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT10 gained initial access by abusing `jjs.exe` to load a malicious DLL and inject shellcode into `svchost.exe`.
   - The specific step in question is the process where the malicious DLL decrypted `svchost.bin` and injected the shellcode to enable further functionality.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, or other artifacts to avoid detection. While this might be part of the overall attack, it does not specifically describe the process of loading and injecting shellcode.
   - **B: T1559.003-XPC Services**
     - This technique involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to execute code. It is not directly related to the process of loading a DLL and injecting shellcode.
   - **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. While it is related to modifying processes, it does not specifically describe the loading and injection of shellcode.
   - **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
     - This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules into the memory space of a process. This is directly related to the process of loading a malicious DLL and injecting shellcode into `svchost.exe`.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a specific technique where a malicious DLL is loaded and shellcode is injected into `svchost.exe`.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this process is **T1129-Shared Modules**.
   - This technique aligns with the described action of loading a shared library (the malicious DLL) and injecting code (the shellcode) into a process (svchost.exe).

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
