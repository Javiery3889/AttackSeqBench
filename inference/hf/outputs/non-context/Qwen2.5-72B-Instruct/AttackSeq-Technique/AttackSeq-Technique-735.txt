### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where detailed reconnaissance information is gathered, and then persistence is achieved without changing the victim's account passwords.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Reconnaissance**: Gathering detailed information about the target, including cyber knowledge and geographic location.
  - **Persistence**: Achieving persistence without changing the victim's account passwords.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1556.005 - Reversible Encryption**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect credentials or other sensitive data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about protecting data rather than a step in the attack sequence described. It does not fit well between reconnaissance and persistence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566 - Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or deploying malware.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is a common method used after gathering reconnaissance information to gain initial access to a system. It fits well between reconnaissance and persistence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as names, addresses, and other personal details.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is related to reconnaissance, it is more specific to identity information and does not necessarily lead directly to persistence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1078.003 - Local Accounts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using existing local accounts to gain access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about using existing accounts to achieve persistence, which is the final step in the sequence described. It does not fit well as the step between reconnaissance and persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker gathers detailed information about the target, including cyber knowledge and geographic location.
2. **Initial Access**: The next logical step is to use the gathered information to gain initial access to the system. Phishing (T1566) is a common method for this.
3. **Persistence**: After gaining access, the attacker achieves persistence without changing the victim's account passwords.

**Final Answer: B: T1566 - Phishing**
