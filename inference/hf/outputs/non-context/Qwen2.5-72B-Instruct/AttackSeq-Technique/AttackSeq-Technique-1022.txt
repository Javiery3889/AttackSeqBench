### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Gamaredon, a known threat actor, gained user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - The next step in the sequence is to ensure that modules execute at every reboot.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** User execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Next Step:** Ensuring modules execute at every reboot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific times or during system events.
     - This could be used to ensure that modules execute at every reboot, but it is a broader category and might not be the most specific for this scenario.

   - **B: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**
     - This technique involves modifying the `UserInitMprLogonScript` or `Shell` value in the Windows registry to load a malicious DLL during the user logon process.
     - This is a specific method to ensure that modules execute at every reboot, making it a strong candidate.

   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection.
     - While this might be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly ensure that modules execute at every reboot.

   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves using the `at` command to schedule tasks.
     - While it can be used to schedule tasks, it is less commonly used for ensuring modules execute at every reboot compared to other methods.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most specific and relevant technique for ensuring that modules execute at every reboot is **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**. This method directly modifies the system to load a malicious DLL during the user logon process, which aligns with the described sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL
