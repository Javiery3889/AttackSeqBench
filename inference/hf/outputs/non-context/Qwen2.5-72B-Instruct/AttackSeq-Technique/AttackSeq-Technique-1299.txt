### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events:
1. Malware collected stored passwords and access tokens from the registry.
2. An execution exploit using CVE-2017-11882 was performed.
3. After the exploit, forensic evidence was removed.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, typically through social engineering. It does not align with the removal of forensic evidence.

- **B: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking the dynamic linker to execute malicious code. It is not related to the removal of forensic evidence.

- **C: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**
  - This technique involves using sudo and sudo caching to gain elevated privileges. It is not related to the removal of forensic evidence.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. This aligns perfectly with the described action of removing forensic evidence after the exploit.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware collected stored passwords and access tokens from the registry.
2. An execution exploit using CVE-2017-11882 was performed.
3. After the exploit, forensic evidence was removed.

The technique that best fits the removal of forensic evidence is **T1070-Indicator Removal**.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
