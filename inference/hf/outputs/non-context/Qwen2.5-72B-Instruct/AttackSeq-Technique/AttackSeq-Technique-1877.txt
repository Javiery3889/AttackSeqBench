### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13 used external servers to deploy web shells for initial access.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred earlier to help FIN13 understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1006-Direct Volume Access**: This technique involves accessing and reading data directly from a volume, which is typically used for data exfiltration or manipulation. It does not align with the initial reconnaissance phase.
- **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**: This technique involves searching for information on public websites and domains, which can be part of the reconnaissance phase but is more specific to gathering technical information rather than organizational structure.
- **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's organization, including its structure, employees, and operations. This aligns well with the need to understand the victim's organizational structure and plan for infiltration.
- **T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic, which is typically used for monitoring and exfiltrating data, not for initial reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 used external servers to deploy web shells.
2. **Preparation for Initial Access**: Before deploying web shells, FIN13 needed to understand the victim's organizational structure to plan the attack effectively.
3. **Reconnaissance Techniques**:
   - **T1006-Direct Volume Access** and **T1040-Network Sniffing** are not relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase.
   - **T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains** is useful for gathering technical information but not specifically for understanding the organizational structure.
   - **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information** is the most relevant technique for understanding the victim's organizational structure and planning the infiltration.

### Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information
