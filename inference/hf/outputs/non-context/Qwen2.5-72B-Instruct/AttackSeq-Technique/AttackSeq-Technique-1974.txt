### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before fake login sites were used to gain covert access to targeted personnel accounts via realistic-looking credential collection pages. This implies a sequence where an initial step is taken to set up the environment for the fake login sites to be effective.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1606-Forge Web Credentials**
  - This technique involves creating fake credentials to gain access to systems. However, it is more about creating fake credentials rather than setting up the environment for a phishing attack.

- **B: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. It is typically used after gaining access to a system, not before setting up a phishing attack.

- **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
  - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. This is a reconnaissance step that could be used to identify which personnel to target with fake login sites.

- **D: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. It is not directly related to setting up fake login sites or gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker needs to identify potential targets before setting up fake login sites. Scanning IP blocks (T1595.001) is a common reconnaissance technique used to identify potential targets.
2. **Phishing**: After identifying the targets, the attacker sets up fake login sites to trick the targets into providing their credentials.
3. **Credential Collection**: The fake login sites are used to collect the credentials of the targeted personnel.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the fake login sites were used is **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**.

### Final Answer: C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks
