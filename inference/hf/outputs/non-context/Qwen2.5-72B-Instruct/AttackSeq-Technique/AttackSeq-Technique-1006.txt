### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malware uses a hijacking DLL for defense evasion, protects shellcode in memory using `localAlloc` and `VirtualProtect`, and then communicates with its C2 infrastructure using a legitimate ESET Remote Administrator tool.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using a hijacking DLL and protecting shellcode in memory.
   - **C2 Communication:** Utilizing a legitimate ESET Remote Administrator tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It does not align with the described C2 communication using a legitimate tool.
   - **B: T1001.001-Junk Data**
     - This sub-technique involves adding junk data to obfuscate the content of data in transit. It does not fit the context of C2 communication using a legitimate tool.
   - **C: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This sub-technique involves using voice communication to trick individuals into providing information or performing actions. It is not relevant to the described C2 communication.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. Using a legitimate tool like ESET Remote Administrator to communicate with the C2 infrastructure often involves encrypted channels to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware uses a hijacking DLL and memory protection techniques for defense evasion.
   - The next step is C2 communication, which is done using a legitimate ESET Remote Administrator tool.
   - The use of a legitimate tool for C2 communication suggests that the communication is likely encrypted to avoid detection.
   - Among the given choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant technique for C2 communication using a legitimate tool.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
