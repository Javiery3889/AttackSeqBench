### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the SBDH malware has already executed and downloaded a backdoor and a data stealer. The next step is to ensure that the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited on the infected system. This implies that the malware needs to persist and be triggered by a specific user action (opening or editing a Word document).

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
  - This technique involves modifying the settings of Office applications (like Word) to run a specific program or script when the application starts. This aligns well with the requirement to ensure the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited.

- **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts (like built-in or service accounts) to gain access to systems. While this can be useful for initial access or privilege escalation, it does not directly relate to ensuring the malware runs when a Word document is opened.

- **C: T1559.001-Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to interact with system components. While it can be used for various malicious activities, it does not specifically ensure that the malware runs when a Word document is opened.

- **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves automating the collection of data from the system. While it is useful for exfiltrating data, it does not ensure that the malware runs when a Word document is opened.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question requires a technique that ensures the malware runs whenever a Word document is opened or edited.
2. **T1137-Office Application Startup** is the only technique that directly addresses this requirement by modifying Office application settings to run a specific program or script when the application starts.
3. The other techniques (T1078.001, T1559.001, and T1119) do not specifically ensure that the malware runs when a Word document is opened.

**Final Answer: A: T1137-Office Application Startup**
