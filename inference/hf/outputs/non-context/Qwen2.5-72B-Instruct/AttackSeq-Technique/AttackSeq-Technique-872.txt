### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by GreyEnergy operators:
1. They used tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain necessary credentials.
2. They then redirected requests through internal C&C proxies to external servers for stealthy communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to execute commands on remote systems. While this could be used for lateral movement, it doesn't directly relate to the redirection of requests through C&C proxies.

- **B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. This could be relevant if the operators were using a vulnerability to set up the C&C communication, but it doesn't specifically address the redirection of requests.

- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. This is typically an early stage in an attack and doesn't align with the described sequence where credentials have already been obtained.

- **D: T1070.004-File Deletion**
  - This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks and remove evidence of the attack. While this could be part of the post-exploitation phase, it doesn't directly relate to the redirection of requests through C&C proxies.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The operators have already gained necessary credentials using tools like Mimikatz and PsExec.
2. The next step is to set up stealthy communication through internal C&C proxies.
3. The technique that best fits this step is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**. While it is not a perfect match, it is the most plausible choice because it involves using a service (in this case, the C&C proxy) to maintain and redirect communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
