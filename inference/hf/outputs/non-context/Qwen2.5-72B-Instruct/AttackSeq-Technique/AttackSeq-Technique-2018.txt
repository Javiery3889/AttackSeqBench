### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Welcome Chat app collects device information, including GPS location.
- The focus is on ensuring the app’s functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
  - This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms that prevent the execution of files downloaded from the internet. It is not related to ensuring an app starts automatically on boot or logon.

- **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a program or script is executed automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This aligns well with the requirement to activate the app’s functionality every time the device starts.

- **Answer Choice C: T1546.014-Emond**
  - This technique is a specific sub-technique of T1546 (Event Triggered Execution) and involves using the Emond service to execute arbitrary commands. While it can be used for persistence, it is not as broadly applicable as T1547 for ensuring autostart on boot or logon.

- **Answer Choice D: T1125-Video Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing video from a device’s camera. It is not related to ensuring an app starts automatically on boot or logon.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question requires a technique that ensures the app’s functionality is activated automatically every time the device starts.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it covers a wide range of methods to achieve this, including registry keys, startup folders, and other mechanisms.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
