### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware sends system information to a C2 server using the command line.
   - The communication with the C2 server is over HTTPS using the POST method.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Malware sends system information to a specific IP address.
   - **Communication Method:** The communication is over HTTPS using the POST method.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**

   - **A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
     - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C2 server. It is not typically associated with HTTPS communication or the POST method.
     - **Relevance:** Low

   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
     - **Relevance:** High
     - **Sub-technique:** T1071.001 (Web Protocols) specifically mentions using HTTP/HTTPS for C2 communication, which aligns with the described scenario.

   - **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
     - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy or execute malicious code.
     - **Relevance:** Low

   - **D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
     - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state, which is not related to C2 communication.
     - **Relevance:** Low

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** because it specifically mentions using HTTPS for C2 communication, which matches the scenario described in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
