### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an initial step where `CertUtil.exe` is executed, disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe`, to evade detection.
- **Objective**: The next step in the attack sequence is to maintain persistence through repeated executions of the downloaded payload.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using a non-standard port for communication, which is typically used for network-level evasion or establishing a backdoor.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to maintaining persistence through repeated executions of a payload.

- **Answer Choice B: T1505.003-Web Shell**
  - **Description**: This technique involves placing a web shell on a web server to maintain persistent access.
  - **Relevance**: While this can be used for maintaining access, it is more about web server compromise and not about scheduling repeated executions of a payload.

- **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to execute a payload at a specified time or interval.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant to maintaining persistence through repeated executions of a payload. Scheduled tasks are a common method for ensuring that a payload is executed regularly, even if the system is restarted.

- **Answer Choice D: T1583.007-Serverless**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using serverless architectures to execute code without the need for a traditional server.
  - **Relevance**: This is not directly related to maintaining persistence on a target system through repeated executions of a payload.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Step**: The attacker uses `CertUtil.exe` disguised as `GoogleUpdate.exe` to evade detection and download a payload.
2. **Objective**: The next step is to ensure that the payload is executed repeatedly to maintain persistence.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: Not relevant for maintaining persistence through repeated executions.
   - **T1505.003-Web Shell**: Not directly related to scheduling repeated executions.
   - **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: Highly relevant for maintaining persistence through repeated executions.
   - **T1583.007-Serverless**: Not relevant for maintaining persistence on the target system.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
