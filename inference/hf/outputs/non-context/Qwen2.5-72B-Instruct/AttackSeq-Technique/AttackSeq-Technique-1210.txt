### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PyFlash gathers system information using commands like `systeminfo` and `tasklist` for reconnaissance.
   - After gathering this information, PyFlash communicates with a hardcoded C&C server via HTTP while encrypting communication with AES-128 in CBC mode.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Gathering system information using `systeminfo` and `tasklist`.
   - **Command and Control (C&C) Communication:** Communicating with a hardcoded C&C server via HTTP.
   - **Data Encryption:** Encrypting communication with AES-128 in CBC mode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**
     - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which is not directly mentioned in the question. However, the communication with a C&C server via HTTP and encryption suggests a form of network communication that could be considered a proxy or a similar technique.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique in this context is the communication with a C&C server, which is a key part of the attack sequence.
   - While the question does not explicitly mention a proxy, the communication with a C&C server via HTTP and encryption aligns closely with the concept of routing network traffic, which is a key aspect of T1090-Proxy.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
