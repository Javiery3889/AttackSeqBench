### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where the Gamaredon group:
1. Injected malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
2. Sent emails with these malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1546.002-Screensaver**
  - This technique involves modifying the screensaver to execute malicious code. It does not align with the described sequence of sending emails with malicious attachments.

- **B: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands. While it is relevant to the user opening the malicious attachment, it does not specifically describe the act of sending the emails.

- **C: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement. It does not align with the described sequence of sending emails with malicious attachments.

- **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails to internal targets within the same organization. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence where the attacker sends emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the organization.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker injected malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
2. The attacker then sent emails with these malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.
3. The technique that best describes the act of sending these emails is **T1534-Internal Spearphishing**.

**Final Answer: D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
