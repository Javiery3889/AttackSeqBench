### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before APT10 staged data for exfiltration using multi-part archives in the Collection phase, leveraging remote command execution scripts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves using dynamic DNS (DDNS) services to maintain command and control (C2) communications. It is typically used in the Command and Control phase, not in the Collection phase.

- **B: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
  - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to automatically send emails to an attacker-controlled account. It is used in the Collection phase to gather data, but it is not directly related to staging data for exfiltration.

- **C: T1074-Data Staged**
  - This technique involves collecting and preparing data for exfiltration. It is a key part of the Collection phase and directly aligns with the scenario described, where data is staged for exfiltration using multi-part archives.

- **D: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
  - This technique involves using a virtual private server (VPS) to host C2 infrastructure. It is typically used in the Command and Control phase, not in the Collection phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Phase**: The question is about the Collection phase, where data is gathered and prepared for exfiltration.
2. **Evaluate the Techniques**:
   - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** and **T1583.003-Virtual Private Server** are more relevant to the Command and Control phase.
   - **T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule** is a data collection technique but not specifically about staging data.
   - **T1074-Data Staged** is the most relevant technique for the Collection phase, as it directly involves preparing data for exfiltration.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT10 used T1074-Data Staged to prepare the data for exfiltration before using multi-part archives and remote command execution scripts.

**Final Answer: C: T1074-Data Staged**
