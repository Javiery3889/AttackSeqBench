### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware "Waterbear" used API hooking to evade detection by modifying functions in memory. After this, the malware connected to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **API Hooking**: This is a technique used to intercept and modify the behavior of functions in memory, often to evade detection.
  - **Connecting to External Entities**: This involves the malware establishing a connection to external servers or entities to receive additional payloads or files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary system.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be used to obfuscate network traffic, it does not directly describe the act of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.

- **Answer Choice B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malware.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the scenario of the malware connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.

- **Answer Choice C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the transfer of tools or other files from an external system to the compromised system.
  - **Relevance**: This directly describes the act of the malware connecting to external entities to receive additional payloads or files, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be used to hide the presence of the malware, it does not describe the act of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The malware "Waterbear" used API hooking to evade detection.
  - After evading detection, the malware connected to external entities to receive additional payloads or files.
  - The technique that best describes the act of receiving additional payloads or files from external entities is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
