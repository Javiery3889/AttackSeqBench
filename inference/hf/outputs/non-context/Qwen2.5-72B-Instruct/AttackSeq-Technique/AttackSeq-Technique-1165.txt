### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Longhorn established persistence using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
2. The attacker then avoided detection using in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the avoidance of detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is more likely to occur after the initial compromise and persistence establishment, not before.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into opening attachments or clicking links. Given that the attack started with a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document, this is a strong candidate for the initial vector of the attack.

- **C: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**
  - This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate files. While it can be used to avoid detection, it is more likely to be used during the initial compromise or persistence establishment, not necessarily before avoiding detection.

- **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate cloud accounts to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the initial compromise via a zero-day exploit in a Word document.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence starts with a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
2. This suggests that the initial vector of the attack is likely a phishing email with a malicious attachment.
3. The technique that best fits this initial vector is **T1566-Phishing**.
4. After the initial compromise, the attacker establishes persistence and then uses in-memory string de-obfuscation and secure erase protocols to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
