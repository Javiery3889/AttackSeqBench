### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor establishes communication with a C&C server using XML messages and collects system and geolocation information. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable secure and encrypted communication for data transmission.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1001.001-Junk Data**
  - This technique involves adding junk data to the payload to evade detection. It does not directly relate to secure and encrypted communication.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C&C) communications. This is directly related to secure and encrypted communication for data transmission.

- **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it can be used to hide malicious activity, it does not specifically address secure and encrypted communication.

- **D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect credentials. It is more specific to credential protection and not to securing C&C communications.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Requirement**: The question requires a technique that enables secure and encrypted communication for data transmission.
2. **Evaluate the Choices**:
   - **A: T1001.001-Junk Data** - Not related to secure communication.
   - **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - Directly related to secure and encrypted communication.
   - **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** - Not specifically related to secure communication.
   - **D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption** - More specific to credential protection.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique that enables secure and encrypted communication for data transmission is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

Final Answer: B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
