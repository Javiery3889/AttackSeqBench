### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an initial access campaign where attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users through a compromised Veteran of Foreign Wars website.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Initial Access**: Compromised website (likely a drive-by compromise).
  - **Exploitation**: Zero-day vulnerability.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP) to communicate with a remote system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for command and control (C2) communication after initial access has been gained. It is not directly related to the initial access method described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
  - **Description**: This technique involves leveraging a trusted relationship between two entities (e.g., a partner network) to gain access to a target network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the scenario described, as the initial access was through a compromised website, not a trusted relationship.

- **Answer Choice C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users who visit the site.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns perfectly with the scenario described. The attackers used a compromised website to target users, which is a classic drive-by compromise.

- **Answer Choice D: T1608.001-Upload Malware**
  - **Description**: This technique involves uploading malware to a remote system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used after initial access has been gained to deliver and execute malware. It is not the initial access method described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes an initial access campaign where attackers used a zero-day vulnerability to target users through a compromised website.
  - The most relevant technique for this initial access method is T1189-Drive-by Compromise, as it involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to users.
  - The other techniques (T1071, T1199, T1608.001) are not directly related to the initial access method described.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
