### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy group to target central Indian government employees.
   - Key activities mentioned:
     - Utilizing GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - Performing discovery to lure victims with decoy documents and cloned websites.
     - Harvesting access credentials from central Indian government employees.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1056.001 - Keylogging**
     - Keylogging involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information, such as passwords. While this could be a method to harvest credentials, the question does not specifically mention keylogging activities.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, such as web browsers, email clients, and other applications. Given that the question mentions exfiltrating authentication databases, this technique is highly relevant.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1110.001 - Password Guessing**
     - Password guessing involves attempting to guess passwords, often through brute force or dictionary attacks. The question does not suggest any guessing or brute force activities.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1591 - Gather Victim Org Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, which is part of the discovery phase. However, the question is specifically asking about the technique used to harvest access credentials, not the initial information gathering.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where SideCopy exfiltrates authentication databases and uses decoy documents and cloned websites to lure victims. The final step in this sequence is harvesting access credentials.
   - The most relevant technique for harvesting credentials from authentication databases is **T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**.
   - This technique aligns with the described activities of exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases and harvesting access credentials.

**Final Answer: B: T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**
