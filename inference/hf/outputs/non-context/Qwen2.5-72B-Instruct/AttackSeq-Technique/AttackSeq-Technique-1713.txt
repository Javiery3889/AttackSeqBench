### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Turla malware, which includes using encryption and rootkit capabilities to evade detection and hide its tracks.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering specific information from systems to enhance the spying operation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - Encryption to evade detection.
     - Rootkit capabilities to hide tracks and store data in a concealed file system.
   - **Next Action:**
     - Gathering specific information from systems to enhance spying.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1561.001-Disk Content Wipe**
     - This technique involves wiping the content of disks, which is typically used to destroy data and cover tracks. It does not align with the goal of gathering information.
   - **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
     - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives, which is a common method for gathering information from systems. This aligns well with the goal of enhancing the spying operation.
   - **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
     - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which are centralized storage locations. This also aligns with the goal of gathering information.
   - **D: T1014-Rootkit**
     - This technique involves the use of rootkits, which is already mentioned in the initial actions. It does not represent the next step in the sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the initial use of encryption and rootkits to evade detection, followed by the collection of specific information to enhance the spying operation.
   - Both B (T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive) and C (T1213-Data from Information Repositories) are relevant, but B is more specific to the context of network shared drives, which are common targets for data exfiltration in spying operations.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive
