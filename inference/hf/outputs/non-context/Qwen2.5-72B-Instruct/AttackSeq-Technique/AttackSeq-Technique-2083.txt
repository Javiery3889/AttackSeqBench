### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack involving the RIG Exploit Kit (EK). The sequence includes:
1. Delivering exploits to victims through malvertising.
2. Redirecting users to exploit kit landing pages.
3. Using an API server through a reverse proxy to Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS) for Command and Control (C2).

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the C2 step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. In the context of the question, a reverse proxy is used to route traffic to the VDS for C2. This aligns well with the described sequence.

- **B: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the search order for executable files to execute malicious code. This is more relevant to post-exploitation activities and does not fit the context of setting up C2 infrastructure.

- **C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to signal the presence of a command and control server. While it can be used in C2, it is not specifically about setting up the infrastructure.

- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. While it is a common C2 technique, it is not specifically about setting up the infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where an API server is used through a reverse proxy to VDS for C2.
2. The reverse proxy is a key component in this setup, as it routes traffic to the VDS.
3. The ATT&CK technique T1090-Proxy directly relates to the use of a proxy to route network traffic, which fits the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
