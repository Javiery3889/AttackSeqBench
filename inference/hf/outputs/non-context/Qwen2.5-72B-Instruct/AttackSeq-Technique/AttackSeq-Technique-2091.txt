### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Carbanak group:
1. They used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and enumerate remote systems.
2. They moved laterally across the infrastructure in search of critical information.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying device drivers on a system. While this can be useful for understanding the environment, it is not typically a step that would occur immediately after network mapping and before lateral movement. It is more relevant for gaining deeper insights into the system's hardware and software configuration.

- **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. While credential dumping is a common step in many attack sequences, it is often performed to facilitate lateral movement. However, it is not necessarily a step that would occur immediately after network mapping and before lateral movement. It is more likely to be a preparatory step for lateral movement.

- **C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**
  - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to gain access to sensitive files or to hide malicious activities. While this can be useful for maintaining persistence or covering tracks, it is not typically a step that would occur immediately after network mapping and before lateral movement. It is more relevant for post-exploitation activities.

- **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations. This is a logical step to take after mapping the internal network and before moving laterally. It helps the attacker to understand the network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Network Mapping and Enumeration**: The Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and enumerate remote systems.
2. **Remote System Discovery**: After mapping the network, the next logical step is to discover and identify specific remote systems that can be targeted for lateral movement.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Once the remote systems are identified, the attacker can move laterally across the infrastructure in search of critical information.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between network mapping and lateral movement is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.

**Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
