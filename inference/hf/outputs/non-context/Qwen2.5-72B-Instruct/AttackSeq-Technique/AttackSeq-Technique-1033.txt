### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the loading of the Kingslayer backdoor via a malicious 'Alpha' software subversion. The backdoor then evades detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the evasion technique.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - This technique involves the use of remote access tools (RATs) to maintain access to a system. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the subversion of the 'Alpha' software or the evasion technique.

- **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
  - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to gain access. This is more related to credential access and persistence, not the initial subversion or evasion.

- **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
  - This technique involves using code that changes its appearance but not its functionality to evade detection. This is a plausible technique that could be used to evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the subversion of the 'Alpha' software.

- **D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as code signing, to gain trust and execute malicious code. This is a strong candidate because it aligns with the subversion of the 'Alpha' software, which is likely a trusted component.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence starts with the subversion of the 'Alpha' software.
2. The subversion of the 'Alpha' software is likely to involve subverting trust controls to ensure the malicious backdoor is executed.
3. After the backdoor is loaded, it uses a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to evade detection.
4. Among the given choices, T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is the most plausible technique that would occur before the evasion technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
