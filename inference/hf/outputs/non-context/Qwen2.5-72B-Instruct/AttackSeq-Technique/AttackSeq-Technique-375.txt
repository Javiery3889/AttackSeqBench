### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Execution of a dropper.
     - Generation of a path in the %TEMP% directory.
     - Performing process hollowing on `msiexec.exe`.
     - Ensuring a malicious file (`ssonsvr.exe` or `srvcl32.dll`) loads during the next system startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.006-Network Security Appliances**
     - This technique involves compromising network security appliances to gain access or maintain persistence. It does not align with the described sequence of actions, which focuses on local system persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that a malicious file or process runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the requirement to load the malicious file during the next system startup.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. While it is related to persistence, it is more specific to services and does not necessarily cover all methods of autostart execution.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
     - This technique involves stealing or creating additional cloud credentials to maintain access. It is not relevant to the described sequence of actions, which are focused on local system persistence.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question involves ensuring that a malicious file loads during the next system startup. This is a clear indication of persistence, specifically through boot or logon autostart execution.
   - The most relevant and aligned technique is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
