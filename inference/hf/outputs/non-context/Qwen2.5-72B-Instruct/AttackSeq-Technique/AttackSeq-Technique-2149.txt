### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware has already achieved persistence using a RunOnce key in the registry.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing command and control (C2) by injecting into a process through Process Hollowing.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence (RunOnce Key):** T1547.001 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
   - **Command and Control (Process Hollowing):** T1055.012 - Process Hollowing

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique is already mentioned as the initial step (RunOnce key in the registry). It cannot be the technique that occurs after persistence.
   - **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering running processes on a system. This is a logical step before injecting into a process for C2, as the adversary needs to know which processes are available to target.
   - **C: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering domain trust relationships, which is more relevant to network reconnaissance and lateral movement. It is less likely to occur immediately after achieving persistence and before establishing C2.
   - **D: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This is the same as choice B and is a logical step before process injection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversary would discover running processes (T1057-Process Discovery) before injecting into a process for C2.

### Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery
