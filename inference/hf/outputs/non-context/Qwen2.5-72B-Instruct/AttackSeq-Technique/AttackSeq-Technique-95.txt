### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The attacker used WMI to check for installed antivirus software and avoided using PowerShell for defense evasion. The next step in the attack sequence is to send information about the detected antivirus software to a C2 server using the domain "webserv-redir.net."
- **Key TTPs**:
  - WMI for checking installed software
  - Avoiding PowerShell for defense evasion
  - Sending information to a C2 server

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic and obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be used to obfuscate the C2 communication, it does not directly describe the act of sending information to a C2 server.

- **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves gathering system information, such as installed software, OS version, and network configuration.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is relevant to the initial step of checking for installed antivirus software, but it does not describe the act of sending information to a C2 server.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant because it describes the act of sending information to a C2 server using a standard protocol, which aligns with the use of the domain "webserv-redir.net."

- **Answer Choice D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using a hybrid identity to gain access to a network or system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the described attack sequence, as it does not involve sending information to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Step**: The attacker used WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The attacker avoided using PowerShell to evade detection.
3. **C2 Communication**: The attacker needed to send the information about the detected antivirus software to a C2 server using the domain "webserv-redir.net."

- **Evaluation**:
  - **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**: Not directly relevant to sending information to a C2 server.
  - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: Relevant to the initial step but not to sending information to a C2 server.
  - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Highly relevant to sending information to a C2 server using a standard protocol.
  - **T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: Not relevant to the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
