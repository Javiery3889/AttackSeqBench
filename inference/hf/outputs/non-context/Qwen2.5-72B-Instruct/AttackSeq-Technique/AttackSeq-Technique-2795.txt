### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7, which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to collect geo-location data from the device?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1132-Data Encoding
  - B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules
  - C: T1614-System Location Discovery
  - D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable or to bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.
- **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: This technique involves modifying or replacing authentication modules to gain access to systems. It is not related to collecting geo-location data.
- **T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves collecting location information from a system, which is directly related to the question of collecting geo-location data.
- **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the system's owner or user, which is not directly related to collecting geo-location data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Goal**: The goal is to collect geo-location data from the device.
2. **Evaluate Each Technique**:
   - **T1132-Data Encoding**: Not relevant to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**: Not relevant to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1614-System Location Discovery**: Directly relevant to collecting geo-location data.
   - **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: Not relevant to collecting geo-location data.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for collecting geo-location data is T1614-System Location Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
