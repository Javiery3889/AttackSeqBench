### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where malicious payloads like SodaMaster are executed using DESLoader through techniques such as DLL side-loading.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves maintaining a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
  - This technique involves adding additional credentials to cloud services to maintain access. It does not align with the described sequence of executing legitimate executable files at regular intervals.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at specific intervals. This aligns well with the described sequence of executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes to maintain a foothold.

- **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it is a common technique in malware, it does not directly relate to maintaining a foothold by executing files at regular intervals.

- **Answer Choice D: T1136-Create Account**
  - This technique involves creating new accounts to maintain access. While it can be used to maintain a foothold, it does not specifically involve executing files at regular intervals.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described involves executing malicious payloads using DLL side-loading, and then maintaining a foothold by executing legitimate executable files every 15 minutes.
- The most plausible technique for maintaining a foothold by executing files at regular intervals is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**.
- This technique allows the attacker to create a scheduled task that runs the legitimate executable files at the specified interval, ensuring persistent access to the system.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
