### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file is used to install the main payload. The key point is that the malware executes the payload without triggering a User Account Control (UAC) pop-up.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: The question focuses on the technique used to bypass UAC.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: Phishing involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions through deceptive emails, websites, or other means.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to bypassing UAC. It is more about initial access and social engineering.

- **Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting various mechanisms that control the elevation of privileges, such as UAC, to gain higher-level access without proper authorization.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant to the scenario described. Bypassing UAC is a common method to execute payloads without user interaction.

- **Answer Choice C: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
  - **Description**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into every process that loads user32.dll by modifying the AppInit_DLLs registry key.
  - **Relevance**: While this can be used to achieve persistence and execute code, it does not directly address the issue of bypassing UAC.

- **Answer Choice D: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
  - **Description**: This technique involves purchasing technical data, such as source code or vulnerabilities, to use in an attack.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the scenario of bypassing UAC or executing a payload.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The malware is delivered via a batch file derived from a decoded CAB file.
2. **Payload Execution**: The main payload is installed.
3. **UAC Bypass**: The payload is executed without triggering a UAC pop-up.

- **T1566-Phishing** is not relevant to UAC bypass.
- **T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism** is directly related to bypassing UAC.
- **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs** is more about persistence and does not address UAC bypass.
- **T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data** is not relevant to the scenario.

### Final Answer: B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
