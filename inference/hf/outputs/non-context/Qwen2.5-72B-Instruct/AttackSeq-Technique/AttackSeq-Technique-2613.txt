### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the Sednit group gathers information about the victim's system through a spoofed URL.
- The next step in the sequence is ensuring persistence using a scheduled task.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the persistence step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick the victim into providing information or performing actions.
  - This does not align well with the use of a spoofed URL, which is typically a web-based technique.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique is used to ensure persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs the attacker's code at regular intervals.
  - This is the technique mentioned in the question as the next step after gathering information, so it cannot be the answer to what occurred before it.

- **Answer Choice C: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
  - This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to hook system functions, which is a more advanced and less common method of persistence.
  - This does not fit the context of the initial information gathering through a spoofed URL.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
  - A spoofed URL is a common method used in phishing attacks to gather information about the victim's system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves gathering information through a spoofed URL, which is a common method used in phishing attacks.
- After gathering the information, the Sednit group ensures persistence using a scheduled task.
- Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before the scheduled task is the phishing attack.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
