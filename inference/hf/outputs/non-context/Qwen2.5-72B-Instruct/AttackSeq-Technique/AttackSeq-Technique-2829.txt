### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where BlackSoul:
1. Collects specified files from the victim's machine.
2. Updates its configuration file.
3. Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel using automated methods.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the data exfiltration step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1037.002-Login Hook**
  - This technique involves modifying the login process to execute malicious code. It is typically used for persistence and does not directly relate to data collection or exfiltration.

- **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
  - This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not directly related to data collection or exfiltration.

- **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. It is often used to hide the presence of malicious files or data before or during exfiltration.

- **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable and more difficult to detect. It is commonly used to prepare data for exfiltration, ensuring that the data can be transmitted without raising suspicion.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection and Configuration Update**:
   - BlackSoul collects specified files and updates its configuration file. This step is necessary to gather the data and prepare for exfiltration.

2. **Preparation for Exfiltration**:
   - Before exfiltrating the data, it is common for attackers to obfuscate or encode the data to avoid detection. This ensures that the data can be transmitted without being intercepted or identified as malicious.

3. **Exfiltration**:
   - The data is then exfiltrated over the C2 channel using automated methods.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that would occur before exfiltration is **T1132-Data Encoding**. This technique is specifically designed to prepare data for exfiltration by making it less recognizable.

### Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding
