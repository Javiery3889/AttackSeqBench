### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker injects hidden DLLs into `iexplore.exe` to provide loading and anti-analysis functionalities.
   - The next step in the sequence involves modifying registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While this might be used in the initial stages of the attack, it does not directly relate to maintaining persistence through registry modifications.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1218.004-InstallUtil**
     - This technique involves using the .NET Framework's `InstallUtil` utility to execute arbitrary code. This is not related to modifying registry keys for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures**
     - This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to execute arbitrary code. This is not related to modifying registry keys for persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves modifying the system to execute code at boot or logon. Specifically, modifying registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` is a common method to achieve this.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves injecting hidden DLLs into `iexplore.exe` and then modifying registry keys to maintain persistence.
   - The technique that aligns with modifying registry keys for persistence is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer choice is **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
