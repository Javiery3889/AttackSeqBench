### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious file named `System.doc` is executed, and FireEye's ExploitGuard detects anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the Defense Evasion phase.
- **Key Elements**:
  - Execution of `System.doc`
  - Anomalous behaviors detected in Microsoft Excel
  - Defense Evasion (T1070)

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which is typically used to gather credentials or sensitive information. This is less likely to be the immediate precursor to Defense Evasion in this context.
  - **B: T1491-Defacement**: This technique involves altering or defacing websites or other digital assets. This is not relevant to the scenario described, as it does not involve execution of a file or anomalous behavior in Excel.
  - **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**: This technique involves altering account properties or credentials. While this could be part of a broader attack, it is not typically the immediate precursor to Defense Evasion in the context of executing a malicious file and detecting anomalous behavior in Excel.
  - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. This is a common technique used to maintain persistence and can be a plausible precursor to Defense Evasion, especially if the malicious file is designed to run periodically and evade detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution of `System.doc`**: The initial step is the execution of the malicious file.
2. **Anomalous Behaviors in Excel**: FireEye's ExploitGuard detects anomalous behaviors in Microsoft Excel, suggesting that the malicious file is interacting with Excel in some way.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The question states that Defense Evasion occurs, which involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
4. **Preceding Technique**: The most plausible technique that would occur before Defense Evasion, given the context, is the creation or modification of a scheduled task or job. This would allow the malicious code to run periodically and evade detection, aligning with the detection of anomalous behaviors in Excel.

**Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
