### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker has already performed lateral movement using compromised credentials to access servers hosting sensitive intellectual property. The next step in the attack sequence is the establishment of communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server using the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**
  - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to gain persistence or execute arbitrary code. While this could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly relate to the establishment of C&C communications.

- **B: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple stages of communication channels to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system. This could be relevant if the attacker is using a multi-stage approach to communicate with the C&C server, but it is not the most specific technique for the described scenario.

- **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to evade detection. This is a common tactic used by backdoors and Trojans to establish C&C communications. Given that PoisonIvy is a backdoor Trojan, it is likely to use non-standard ports to communicate with the C&C server.

- **D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems. While this is relevant to the lateral movement phase, it does not directly relate to the establishment of C&C communications.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the establishment of C&C communications after lateral movement.
2. The most relevant technique for establishing C&C communications is likely to involve the use of non-standard ports to evade detection.
3. Among the given choices, T1571-Non-Standard Port is the most specific and relevant technique for this part of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
