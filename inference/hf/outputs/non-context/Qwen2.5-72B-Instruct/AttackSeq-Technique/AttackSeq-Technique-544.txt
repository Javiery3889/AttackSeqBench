### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the threat actors gained initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.
   - The key elements are:
     - Initial access via spearphishing.
     - Malicious Word documents with VBA macros.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves the acquisition of infrastructure (e.g., domains, servers, email accounts) to support the attack. While this is a common preparatory step, it is not directly related to the initial access method described.
   - **B: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood:**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the target's operating system with resource requests, leading to a denial of service. This is not a typical method for gaining initial access and does not align with the spearphishing scenario.
   - **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. While this can be a method for initial access, it is not related to the spearphishing with malicious Word documents described.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access. The specific sub-technique T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) aligns perfectly with the scenario described, where malicious Word documents with VBA macros are used.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actors used phishing (T1566) to gain initial access via spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
