### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a VBA macro is executed using `mshta.exe` to download a dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure continuous execution of the malicious code every two hours.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Execution:** VBA macro is executed using `mshta.exe`.
   - **Download and Execution:** The dropper VBScript is downloaded from a Blogspot URL.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The malicious code needs to be executed continuously every two hours.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
     - This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, such as making the data less useful or trustworthy. It does not fit the context of ensuring continuous execution of malicious code.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code through social engineering. While it might be used to initially deliver the VBA macro, it does not ensure continuous execution.
   - **C: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
     - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into a Terminal Services process. It is not related to scheduling tasks or ensuring continuous execution.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves creating a scheduled task or job to execute the malicious code at regular intervals. This fits the context of ensuring continuous execution every two hours.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Execution and Download:**
   - The VBA macro is executed using `mshta.exe` to download the dropper VBScript from a Blogspot URL.
2. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - To ensure the malicious code runs every two hours, the attacker would need to set up a mechanism that triggers the execution at regular intervals.
   - The most appropriate technique for this is **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**, which allows the attacker to create a scheduled task that runs the malicious code every two hours.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
