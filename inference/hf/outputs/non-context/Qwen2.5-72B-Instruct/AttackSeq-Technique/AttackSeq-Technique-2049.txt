### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker has harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections. The next step in the attack sequence is to facilitate movement within the target's networks.
- **Key TTPs**: Harvesting credentials, movement within the network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as names, addresses, and other personal details. While this can be useful for social engineering, it does not directly facilitate movement within the network after credentials have already been harvested.

- **Answer Choice B: T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials (such as passwords, tokens, or session IDs) to authenticate and gain access to systems. This is a direct method to facilitate movement within the network after credentials have been harvested.

- **Answer Choice C: T1547.015 - Login Items**
  - This technique involves modifying login items to ensure that malicious software is executed when a user logs in. While this can be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly facilitate movement within the network using harvested credentials.

- **Answer Choice D: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to distribute and execute malicious code. While this can be used to spread malware, it does not directly facilitate movement within the network using harvested credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attacker has already harvested corporate and personal email credentials through social media connections.
  - The next logical step to facilitate movement within the network is to use these credentials to authenticate and gain access to other systems.
  - **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material** is the most appropriate technique for this scenario, as it directly involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within the network.

**Final Answer: B: T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**
