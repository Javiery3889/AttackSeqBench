### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary initially uses DLL Hijacking (T1574) to trick users into executing malware.
   - After gaining initial execution, the adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Execution: DLL Hijacking (T1574)
   - Persistence: Planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance**
     - This technique involves reverting a cloud instance to a previous state, which is not related to maintaining persistence or initial execution.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is typically used to reveal the true nature of malware but is not directly related to maintaining persistence.
   - **C: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to boot a system, which is not relevant to the described attack sequence.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware is executed automatically at boot or logon, which aligns with the described method of maintaining persistence by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Execution:**
   - The adversary uses DLL Hijacking (T1574) to trick users into executing malware. This is a common technique for initial execution.
2. **Persistence:**
   - After gaining initial execution, the adversary plants a copy of a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL. This is a form of persistence where the malware ensures it runs automatically at boot or logon.
3. **Relevance of T1547:**
   - T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is the most relevant technique because it describes methods to ensure that the malware is executed automatically, which is exactly what the adversary is doing by planting a legitimate binary that loads a malicious DLL.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
