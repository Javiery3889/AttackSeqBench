### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Downloading malware using BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service).
     - Deleting traces of their activity through batch files.
     - Using brute-forcing and scanning tools during reconnaissance to enumerate services, fingerprint remote servers, and authenticate on ports.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.002-SAML Tokens**
     - This technique involves the manipulation of SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) tokens, which is typically used for authentication and authorization. It does not fit well with the sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. While this could be a part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not fit well with the sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1036.010-Masquerade Account Name**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying account names to appear legitimate. This could be used to maintain persistence or evade detection, but it does not fit well with the sequence of downloading malware and deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This fits well with the sequence of deleting traces of their activity through batch files.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. **Downloading malware using BITS:** This is an initial step to gain a foothold in the system.
     2. **Deleting traces of their activity through batch files:** This is a post-exploitation step to cover their tracks and avoid detection.
     3. **Using brute-forcing and scanning tools during reconnaissance:** This is a subsequent step to gather information and further their attack.
   - The technique that fits best between downloading malware and using brute-forcing and scanning tools is **T1070-Indicator Removal**. This technique is used to remove or alter indicators of compromise, which aligns with the step of deleting traces of their activity.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
