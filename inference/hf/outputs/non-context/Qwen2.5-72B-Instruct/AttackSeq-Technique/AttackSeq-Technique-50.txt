### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before a PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers and used methods like `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download payloads.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to obfuscate traffic, it is not typically a prerequisite for a PowerShell script to communicate with C2 servers.

- **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While it is a common initial access technique, it is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers or the downloading of payloads.

- **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's network. This is a plausible step that could occur before the PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers and downloads payloads. The script might need to transfer additional tools or payloads to the victim's system.

- **D: T1027.003-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While it can be used to obfuscate the communication, it is not a necessary step before the PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers and downloads payloads.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access to the system, possibly using valid accounts (T1078).
2. **Tool Transfer**: The attacker transfers the PowerShell script or other tools to the victim's system (T1105).
3. **C2 Communication**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers.
4. **Payload Download**: The script uses methods like `DownloadString` and `DownloadData` to request and download additional payloads.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the PowerShell script communicated with C2 servers and downloaded payloads is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
