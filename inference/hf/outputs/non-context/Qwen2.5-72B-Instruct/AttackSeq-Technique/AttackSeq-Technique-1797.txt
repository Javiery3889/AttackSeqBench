### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1218.013-Mavinject**
  - Mavinject is a technique used to load and execute arbitrary code by injecting it into a legitimate process. This technique is typically used after initial access has been gained, not before.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to gain initial access by tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening weaponized documents. This aligns perfectly with the scenario described, where the OceanLotus Group used spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word documents.

- **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves the development of custom tools and capabilities by the adversary. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs before the actual attack and is not directly related to gaining initial access.

- **D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
  - This sub-technique involves the use of digital certificates to sign malware or tools. This is often used to make the malware appear more legitimate but is not a direct method for gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The OceanLotus Group used spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word documents to gain initial access. This is a clear example of the Phishing technique (T1566).
  - The other techniques (Mavinject, Develop Capabilities, and Digital Certificates) are either used after initial access has been gained or are preparatory steps that do not directly lead to initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
