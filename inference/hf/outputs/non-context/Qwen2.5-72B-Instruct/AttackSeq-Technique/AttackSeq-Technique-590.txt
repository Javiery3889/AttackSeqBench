### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers:
1. Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
2. Created public registry accounts that mimicked popular software or packages.
3. Tricked developers into pulling and running malicious container images.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of valid domain accounts to gain access to systems. It does not align with the scenario of creating public registry accounts to trick developers.

- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party service or product to gain access to the target. In this case, the attackers are creating public registry accounts that mimic popular software, which can be seen as a form of supply chain compromise. This aligns well with the scenario.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services to host or deliver malicious content. While it could be related, it does not specifically address the creation of public registry accounts to mimic popular software.

- **D: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or performing actions. It does not align with the scenario of creating public registry accounts.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports, which is an initial access vector.
2. They then created public registry accounts that mimicked popular software or packages.
3. These accounts were used to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images, which is a form of supply chain compromise.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**.

**Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
