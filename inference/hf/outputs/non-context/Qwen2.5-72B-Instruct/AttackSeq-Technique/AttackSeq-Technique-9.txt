### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has achieved persistence by adding registry run keys with a disguised legitimate executable.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this persistence mechanism is established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Run Keys (T1547.001):** The malware has already achieved persistence by adding a registry run key.
   - **Disguised Legitimate Executable:** The malware is using a legitimate-looking executable to blend in with normal system processes.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about cloud accounts. It is not directly related to the next logical step after achieving persistence via registry run keys.
   - **B: T1055-Process Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process. This is a common next step after achieving persistence, as the malware may need to maintain its presence and perform additional actions.
   - **C: T1547.005-Security Support Provider:**
     - This technique involves modifying or adding a Security Support Provider (SSP) to intercept and manipulate security-related functions. This is a more advanced persistence technique and is less likely to be the immediate next step after adding a registry run key.
   - **D: T1012-Query Registry:**
     - This technique involves querying the registry to gather information. While it is a common technique, it is typically used for reconnaissance and not as a next step after achieving persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step after achieving persistence via registry run keys is to perform process injection (T1055) to maintain control and execute additional malicious activities.

### Final Answer: B: T1055-Process Injection
