### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance:** Using `adfind` and PowerSploit to gather network configuration and domain information.
     - **Initial Access:** Sending spear phishing emails with malicious links.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
     - This technique involves bypassing network address translation (NAT) to gain access to internal network resources. It is typically used to maintain persistence or to move laterally within a network, not for reconnaissance or initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
     - This technique involves using digital certificates to establish trust and secure communications. It is more relevant to maintaining persistence or exfiltrating data, not for reconnaissance or initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
     - This technique involves exploiting mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. It is typically used after gaining initial access to elevate privileges, not for reconnaissance or initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning the network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. It is a logical step to take after gathering initial reconnaissance data and before attempting to gain initial access through spear phishing.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used `adfind` and PowerSploit to gather network configuration and domain information.
   - **Active Scanning:** After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to actively scan the network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** Once the targets are identified, the threat group would then send spear phishing emails with malicious links to gain initial access.

### Final Answer: D: T1595-Active Scanning
