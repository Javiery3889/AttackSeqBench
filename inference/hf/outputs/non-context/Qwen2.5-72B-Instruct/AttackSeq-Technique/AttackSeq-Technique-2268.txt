### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has exfiltrated collected email accounts through a POST web request. The focus is on identifying the ATT&CK technique that facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send the collected data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it can be used to obfuscate the origin of the traffic, it is not specifically about facilitating communication with domains to download malware or send data.

- **B: T1546.013-PowerShell Profile**
  - This technique involves modifying PowerShell profiles to execute arbitrary code when PowerShell is launched. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly facilitate communication with domains to download malware or send data.

- **C: T1114-Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email data from the victim's system. While it is part of the exfiltration process, it does not describe the communication method used to send the data.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) to communicate with a remote system. This is the most relevant technique for facilitating the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download malware and send collected data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the exfiltration of email accounts through a POST web request.
2. The focus is on the communication method used by the PowerShell script to interact with the domains.
3. Among the given choices, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant because it directly involves using standard protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with remote systems, which is necessary for downloading malware and sending collected data.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
