### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where APT12 used spear phishing emails to exploit CVE-2012-0158 for initial access. After gaining initial access, the question asks about the Command and Control (C2) technique involving HIGHTIDE's communication with an IP address.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Spear Phishing (T1566)
  - Exploit: CVE-2012-0158
  - C2 Communication: HIGHTIDE with an IP address

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While dynamic resolution can be used in C2, it is not specifically mentioned in the context of HIGHTIDE's communication.

- **Answer Choice B: T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more related to file manipulation and not directly to C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access.
  - **Relevance**: This is already mentioned in the initial access phase and is not relevant to the C2 communication phase.

- **Answer Choice D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: HIGHTIDE is known to use encrypted communication channels to maintain C2. This aligns well with the described scenario.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT12 used spear phishing emails to exploit CVE-2012-0158, gaining initial access to the target system.
2. **C2 Communication**: After gaining access, HIGHTIDE, a known malware, would establish C2 communication with an IP address.
3. **C2 Technique**: HIGHTIDE is known to use encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection.

Given the context and the known behavior of HIGHTIDE, the most plausible C2 technique is the use of an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
