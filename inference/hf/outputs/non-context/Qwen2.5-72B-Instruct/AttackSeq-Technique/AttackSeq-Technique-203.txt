### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group FamousSparrow. The sequence includes:
  1. Injecting encrypted shellcode (MpSvc.dll) into processes.
  2. Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from compromised systems.
- **Task**: Identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred between these two actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1005-Data from Local System**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could be useful for reconnaissance or exfiltration but is not typically a step between process injection and credential dumping.
  - **B: T1612-Build Image on Host**: This technique involves building an image on the host, which is more related to persistence or establishing a foothold and is not a common step between process injection and credential dumping.
  - **C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network shares, which is useful for lateral movement and reconnaissance but is not typically a step between process injection and credential dumping.
  - **D: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into processes, which is already mentioned in the question as the first step. Therefore, it cannot be the technique that occurs between the two actions described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The sequence described involves injecting shellcode into processes and then using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
  - Between these two actions, the attacker would likely need to perform some form of reconnaissance or data collection to identify the processes and systems where credentials are stored.
  - **T1005-Data from Local System** is the most plausible technique because it involves collecting data from the local system, which could include identifying processes and systems that store credentials.
  - The other techniques (T1612, T1135, and T1055) do not fit as well into the sequence described.

**Final Answer: A: T1005-Data from Local System**
