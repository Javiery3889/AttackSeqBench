### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS. The sequence involves:
1. Establishing initial access to the targeted systems.
2. Executing Shellcode scripts in memory.
3. Using Beacon mode for network communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the initial access technique:

- **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for initial access, it typically requires prior knowledge or compromise of credentials, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. This is a common method for initial access, especially for APT groups, as it can be done remotely and often does not require prior knowledge of internal credentials.

- **C: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
  - This technique involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to interact with other processes. It is more commonly used for lateral movement or maintaining persistence rather than initial access.

- **D: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**
  - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to gain elevated privileges. It is typically used for privilege escalation or persistence, not for initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access Requirement**: The question specifically asks for the technique that allowed attackers to establish initial access.
2. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts** - While possible, it requires prior knowledge or compromise of credentials.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** - This is a common and effective method for initial access, especially for APT groups.
   - **C: T1559-Inter-Process Communication** - More relevant for lateral movement or persistence.
   - **D: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness** - More relevant for privilege escalation or persistence.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible technique for establishing initial access is **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

### Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
