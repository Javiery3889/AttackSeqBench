### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses the Milestone backdoor to create an administrator user for privilege escalation. The next step in the attack sequence involves evading detection by hiding malicious artifacts such as files and processes.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: 
  - **Privilege Escalation**: Creating an administrator user.
  - **Evasion**: Hiding malicious artifacts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading**
  - **Description**: Masquerading involves renaming or modifying the attributes of files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate or to blend in with the system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique can be used to hide malicious artifacts by making them look like legitimate system files or processes. However, it is more about renaming and modifying attributes rather than hiding them.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding files and directories to prevent detection by users and security tools.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the need to hide malicious artifacts such as files and processes. It is a common method used to evade detection.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using images to deliver or execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to hiding files and processes. It is more about using images as a vector for delivering malware.

- **Answer Choice D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - **Description**: This technique involves acquiring tools, capabilities, or credentials to support the attack.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to hiding files and processes. It is more about the initial stages of the attack, such as obtaining the necessary tools or credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions hiding malicious artifacts such as files and processes to evade detection.
  - **T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories** directly addresses the need to hide files and directories, which is the most relevant technique for this scenario.
  - **T1036-Masquerading** is also a form of evasion but is more about making files and processes appear legitimate rather than hiding them.
  - **T1204.003-Malicious Image** and **T1588-Obtain Capabilities** are not relevant to the specific task of hiding files and processes.

**Final Answer: B: T1564.001-Hidden Files and Directories**
