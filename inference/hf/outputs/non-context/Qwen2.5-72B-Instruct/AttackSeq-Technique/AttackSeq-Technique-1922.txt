### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10:
1. Staging data for exfiltration.
2. Using multi-part archives and compression tools.
3. Launching these tools via remote command execution scripts.
4. Leveraging shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure to execute data transfer.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1020.001-Traffic Duplication**
  - This technique involves duplicating network traffic to monitor or manipulate it. It is not directly related to the staging and exfiltration of data using compression and remote command execution.

- **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves compressing and archiving data to make it easier to exfiltrate. This aligns with the use of multi-part archives and compression tools mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1055.013-Process Doppelg√§nging**
  - This technique involves a method of process injection and evasion. It is not directly related to the staging and exfiltration of data.

- **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, which could be a logical next step after staging and compressing the data. However, the question specifically mentions the use of shared MSP infrastructure, which suggests a more direct method of exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Staging Data for Exfiltration**: This is the initial step where data is prepared for exfiltration.
2. **Using Multi-Part Archives and Compression Tools**: This aligns with the technique **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.
3. **Launching Tools via Remote Command Execution Scripts**: This is a method of executing the compression and archiving tools.
4. **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure**: This suggests a direct method of exfiltration, which is more aligned with the use of shared infrastructure rather than alternative protocols.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible next step after staging and compressing the data would be to exfiltrate it using the shared MSP infrastructure. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred **after** the staging and compression, which is **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.

**Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
