### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where the 'yty' framework communicates with its C2 server by:
1. Downloading a file from Google Docs to retrieve its host.
2. Sending beacon messages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate web services to host and communicate with their C2 infrastructure. While this could be relevant, it doesn't specifically describe the action of downloading a file from Google Docs.

- **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves adversaries using various methods to hide their infrastructure, such as using domain fronting or other obfuscation techniques. This is not directly related to downloading a file from Google Docs.

- **C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves adversaries collecting data from information repositories, which can include cloud storage services like Google Docs. This aligns well with the action of downloading a file from Google Docs to retrieve the host information.

- **D: T1216-System Script Proxy Execution**
  - This technique involves adversaries using system scripts to execute commands or other scripts, often to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads. This does not directly relate to the action of downloading a file from Google Docs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The 'yty' framework needs to retrieve its host information from Google Docs.
2. Downloading a file from Google Docs to retrieve host information is a form of collecting data from an information repository.
3. The technique that best describes this action is T1213-Data from Information Repositories.

**Final Answer: C: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
