### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the method Regin uses to maintain communication with the C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure after collecting data through advanced RAT (Remote Access Tool) features such as capturing screenshots and monitoring network traffic.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with the C2 server. This is a common method for maintaining communication in a way that blends in with normal network traffic, making it harder to detect.

- **B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to obfuscate the communication. While this can be used to evade detection, it is not typically the primary method for maintaining communication with the C2 server.

- **C: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. While it is useful for collecting data, it is not a method for maintaining communication with the C2 server.

- **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting a user's Security Identifier (SID) history to gain access to resources. This is more related to privilege escalation and lateral movement, not communication with the C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: Regin uses advanced RAT features to capture screenshots and monitor network traffic.
2. **Communication with C2**: After collecting the data, Regin needs to exfiltrate it to the C2 server.
3. **Evasion and Stealth**: To avoid detection, Regin would likely use a method that blends in with normal network traffic.

Given these points, the most plausible method for Regin to maintain communication with the C2 infrastructure is using standard application layer protocols (T1071).

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
