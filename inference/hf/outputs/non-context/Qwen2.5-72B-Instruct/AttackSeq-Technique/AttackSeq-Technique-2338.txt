### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: APT12 used spear phishing emails to exploit CVE-2012-0158 for initial access. After gaining access, they used backdoors like HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT to establish communication with C2 servers.
- **Key TTPs**: Initial access via spear phishing, exploitation of CVE-2012-0158, and establishing C2 communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - **Description**: SSH Hijacking involves taking over an existing SSH session to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used in the context of initial access via spear phishing or in the immediate steps following the exploitation of a vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers.
  - **Relevance**: This is a common technique used to establish and maintain C2 communication after gaining initial access. It aligns well with the scenario where backdoors are used to communicate with C2 servers.

- **Answer Choice C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - **Description**: Process Hollowing involves creating a new process in a suspended state, unmapping its memory, and then writing the payload into the process's memory before resuming it.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, which can be a step in establishing persistence or evading detection. However, it is not directly related to the initial communication with C2 servers.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network connections to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for maintaining stealth, it is not a necessary step for establishing initial C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT12 gains initial access via spear phishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
2. **Backdoor Deployment**: Backdoors like HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT are deployed.
3. **C2 Communication**: The backdoors need to establish communication with C2 servers to maintain control.

Given the sequence of events, the most logical step between gaining initial access and establishing C2 communication is the use of standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
