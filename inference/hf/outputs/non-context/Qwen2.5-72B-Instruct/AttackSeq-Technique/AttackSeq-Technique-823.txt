### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the FIN4 group:
1. Organizing targeted individuals using campaign codes.
2. Transmitting information to C2 servers along with stolen credentials.
3. Capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1528-Steal Application Access Token**
  - This technique involves stealing access tokens from applications, which is not directly related to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with VBA macros.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which can be used to steal credentials. This is a plausible technique for capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with VBA macros.

- **C: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
  - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to send copies of emails to an attacker-controlled account. While this can be used to exfiltrate information, it is not directly related to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with VBA macros.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is not directly related to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails with VBA macros.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a spearphishing attack where VBA macros are used to capture user credentials.
2. Among the given choices, **T1056-Input Capture** is the most relevant technique because it involves capturing user input, which can include credentials.
3. The other techniques (T1528, T1114.003, and T1070) do not directly align with the described method of capturing credentials through spearphishing emails with VBA macros.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
