### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Babar's dropper uses global Windows hooks to invade desktop applications for logging keystrokes and capturing screenshots. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial activity.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
  - This technique involves using mechanisms to communicate between processes. While it could be used in conjunction with keylogging and screenshot capturing, it is not a direct next step in the sequence described.

- **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**
  - This technique involves dumping the Management Information Base (MIB) of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent. This is not related to keylogging or screenshot capturing and seems out of context.

- **C: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which aligns directly with the described activity of logging keystrokes. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **after** the keylogging and screenshot capturing.

- **D: T1583.001-Domains**
  - This technique involves the acquisition of domains, which is typically used for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. This could be a plausible next step after capturing keystrokes and screenshots, as the attacker might need to exfiltrate the captured data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Activity**: Babar's dropper uses global Windows hooks to log keystrokes and capture screenshots.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After capturing the data, the attacker would need to exfiltrate it to a remote server or command and control (C2) infrastructure.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1559-Inter-Process Communication** - Not a direct next step.
   - **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)** - Not related to the described activity.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture** - This is the initial activity, not the next step.
   - **D: T1583.001-Domains** - This is a plausible next step for exfiltrating the captured data.

### Final Answer: D: T1583.001-Domains
