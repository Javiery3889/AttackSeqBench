### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website.
- **Objective**: Determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after gaining initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1569-System Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This is a post-compromise technique, but it is more about maintaining persistence or execution, which is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory information on a system.
  - **Relevance**: This is a common next step after gaining initial access, as the adversary needs to understand the environment and locate potential targets or sensitive information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1569.002-Service Execution**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves adversaries executing code via system services.
  - **Relevance**: Similar to T1569, this is more about execution and persistence, which is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
  - **Relevance**: This is a common next step after gaining initial access, as the adversary often needs to transfer additional tools to perform further actions, such as reconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app.
2. **Next Steps**:
   - **Discovery**: The adversary needs to understand the environment and locate potential targets or sensitive information.
   - **Tool Transfer**: The adversary may need to transfer additional tools to perform further actions.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is a logical next step for reconnaissance.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** is also a logical next step for preparing further actions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both T1083 and T1105 are plausible, but T1105 is more likely to occur immediately after gaining initial access because the adversary needs to bring in additional tools to perform further actions.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
