### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
1. **Lateral Movement**: Using legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally within the network.
2. **Data Collection**: Collecting user, network, and process data using system utilities like `net user` and `tasklist.exe`.
3. **C2 Communication**: Facilitating communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers that are hosted on legitimate domains.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software installed on a system or in a cloud environment.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about discovering software, which is not directly related to the communication with C2 servers.

- **B: T1216.002-SyncAppvPublishingServer**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use the SyncAppvPublishingServer PowerShell cmdlet to publish and deploy App-V packages, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to deploying App-V packages and does not relate to C2 communication.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use legitimate web services to communicate with C2 servers. This can include using web applications, APIs, or other web-based protocols to send and receive data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the described scenario of using legitimate domains to host C2 servers and facilitating communication.

- **D: T1090-Proxy**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to obfuscate C2 communication, it is not specifically about using legitimate domains to host C2 servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker used legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally within the network.
2. **Data Collection**: The attacker collected user, network, and process data using system utilities.
3. **C2 Communication**: The attacker needed to communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most relevant technique for facilitating communication with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains is **T1102-Web Service**.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
