### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script communicates with command and control (C2) domains to download malware and manage data exchanges. The next step in the sequence involves hindering static analysis through file obfuscation.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1547.010-Port Monitors**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating port monitors to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to file obfuscation or hindering static analysis.

- **B: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls**
  - This technique involves using the `ptrace` system call to manipulate processes. It is primarily used for process injection and manipulation, not for file obfuscation.

- **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
  - This technique involves the process of deobfuscating or decoding files or information. While this technique is about deobfuscation, it is the reverse of what we are looking for. We need a technique that involves obfuscation to hinder static analysis.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it is related to the initial use of PowerShell, it does not specifically address file obfuscation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for a technique that hinders static analysis through file obfuscation.
- The most relevant technique for file obfuscation is not directly listed, but the closest related technique is **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**. However, this technique is about deobfuscation, not obfuscation.
- Given the options, the most plausible choice is **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** because it is the only one that deals with the manipulation of files or information, which is a step in the process of obfuscation and deobfuscation.

However, since the question specifically asks for a technique that hinders static analysis through file obfuscation, and none of the provided options directly address obfuscation, the best answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
