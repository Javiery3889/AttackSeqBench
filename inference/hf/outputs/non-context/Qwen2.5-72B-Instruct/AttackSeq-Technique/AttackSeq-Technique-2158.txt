### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where FlowCloud has established persistence by installing components to a specified directory and configuring registry keys for keylogger drivers and malware configuration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in this sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it is a common technique for maintaining command and control (C2) communication, it is not directly related to the initial steps of establishing persistence and configuring keyloggers.
   - **T1665-Hide Infrastructure:**
     - This technique involves hiding the infrastructure used for the attack, such as using domain fronting or other methods to obfuscate the true origin of the C2 traffic. This is a plausible next step after establishing persistence, but it is not the most immediate or necessary step.
   - **T1129-Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves using shared modules or libraries to perform various functions, such as loading additional components or executing specific tasks. Given that FlowCloud has already installed components and configured registry keys, it is plausible that the next step could involve loading additional shared modules to extend its functionality.
   - **T1127.002-ClickOnce:**
     - This technique involves using ClickOnce, a deployment technology for .NET applications, to deliver and execute malicious payloads. While it is a method for initial access or delivery, it is not typically used after persistence has already been established.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The initial steps described in the question involve establishing persistence and configuring keyloggers. The next logical step would be to load additional components or modules to extend the functionality of the malware.
     - Among the given options, **T1129-Shared Modules** is the most plausible next step because it aligns with the need to load additional components after the initial persistence and configuration.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - The most likely ATT&CK technique to occur after FlowCloud has established persistence and configured keyloggers is **T1129-Shared Modules**.

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
