### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlackEnergy 3 malware was executed on workstations.
   - The execution was a result of employees enabling macros in weaponized phishing email attachments.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Employees receiving and opening a phishing email.
     2. Employees enabling macros in the email attachment.
     3. BlackEnergy 3 malware being executed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1569.001-Launchctl:**
     - This technique involves using the `launchctl` utility on macOS to execute commands or programs.
     - This is not relevant to the initial infection vector described in the question, which involves phishing and macros.

   - **B: T1129-Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code.
     - While this could be part of the malware's execution process, it does not describe the initial infection vector.

   - **C: T1018-Remote System Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering remote systems on the network.
     - This is typically a post-compromise activity and does not describe the initial infection vector.

   - **D: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, often through social engineering.
     - This aligns perfectly with the scenario where employees are tricked into enabling macros in a phishing email attachment, leading to the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the employees were tricked into enabling macros in a phishing email attachment, which led to the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware.
- This aligns with the T1204-User Execution technique, which involves social engineering to get users to execute malicious code.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
