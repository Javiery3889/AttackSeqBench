### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
- **Key TTPs**: Webshells, RDP tunneling, lateral movement.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
  - **Description**: This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not relevant to the context of using webshells for RDP tunneling and lateral movement.
  - **Relevance**: Low

- **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications.
  - **Relevance**: While encryption might be used in the tunneling process, it does not directly enable the exploitation of remote systems.

- **Answer Choice C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems.
  - **Relevance**: High. After gaining initial access via webshells and tunneling RDP traffic, exploiting remote services (such as RDP) is a logical next step for lateral movement and remote exploitation.

- **Answer Choice D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares for lateral movement.
  - **Relevance**: While SMB can be used for lateral movement, the question specifically mentions RDP tunneling, which is more directly related to T1210.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Agrius used webshells to gain initial access to the network.
2. **Tunneling RDP Traffic**: They then tunneled RDP traffic to move laterally within the network.
3. **Exploitation of Remote Services**: To exploit systems remotely within the targeted network, they would likely use techniques that involve exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services, such as RDP.

**Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
