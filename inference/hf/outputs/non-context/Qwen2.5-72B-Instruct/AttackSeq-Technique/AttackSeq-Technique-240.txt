### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group has established persistence using a hidden 'autoupdater' module. The group is using a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic to remain undetected.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Persistence**: Hidden 'autoupdater' module.
  - **Stealth**: Using a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves stealing financial data, which is not directly related to maintaining stealth or using legitimate-looking applications.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice for the described scenario.

- **Answer Choice B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - **Relevance**: Process hollowing is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate process, making it appear benign to security tools.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique aligns well with the use of a legitimate-looking application to remain undetected.

- **Answer Choice C: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using customer relationship management (CRM) software for malicious purposes, which is not directly related to maintaining stealth or using legitimate-looking applications.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice for the described scenario.

- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection by security tools.
  - **Evaluation**: While this technique can help in maintaining stealth, it does not specifically address the use of a legitimate-looking application.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The scenario describes the use of a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic to remain undetected.
  - **Process Hollowing (T1055.012)** is a technique that involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process, making it appear benign to security tools. This aligns well with the use of a legitimate-looking application.
  - **Obfuscation (T1027)** is also a relevant technique for maintaining stealth, but it does not specifically address the use of a legitimate-looking application.
  - The other choices (T1657 and T1213.004) are not relevant to the described scenario.

**Final Answer: B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
