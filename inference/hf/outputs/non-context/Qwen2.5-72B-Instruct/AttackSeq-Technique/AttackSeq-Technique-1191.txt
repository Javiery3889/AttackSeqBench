### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker uses the RMS (Remote Management Software) tool to evade detection.
- The RMS executable then establishes communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server located in Germany.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1204-User Execution**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, typically through social engineering. This does not fit the scenario of the RMS tool establishing communication with a C2 server.
- **T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**: This technique involves using fast-flux DNS to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with a domain to evade detection. While this could be used in a C2 communication, it is not the primary technique for establishing the communication itself.
- **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This is a broad category that includes various protocols.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This is a sub-technique of T1071 and specifically involves using web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a more specific and likely fit for the scenario described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Evasion**: The RMS tool is used to evade detection, which is a common tactic in the initial stages of an attack.
2. **C2 Communication**: The RMS executable then establishes communication with a C2 server. This communication is a critical step in maintaining control over the compromised system.
3. **Protocol Used**: The most likely protocol for this communication, especially given the context of a C2 server, is a web protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) due to their common use and ability to blend in with normal traffic.

Given the above reasoning, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
