### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where malware gains access to a victim system and then executes a backdoor by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename. The focus is on identifying the initial technique used to gain access to the victim system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
  - This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often through scripts or other mechanisms. It is not typically used as an initial access technique but rather as a method to execute commands after gaining access.

- **B: T1560.001-Archive via Utility**
  - This technique involves compressing data using utilities like `tar`, `zip`, etc. It is used for data exfiltration or to reduce the size of data before exfiltration. It is not an initial access technique.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or deploying malware. Phishing is a common initial access technique.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system. It is another common initial access technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access Techniques**:
   - The question is asking for the technique used to gain initial access to the victim system.
   - Both T1566 (Phishing) and T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) are initial access techniques.

2. **Context of the Attack**:
   - The malware then executes a backdoor by rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized filename. This suggests that the initial access was likely through a user interaction or a vulnerability that allowed the malware to be deployed.

3. **Common Scenarios**:
   - **Phishing (T1566)**: Users are often tricked into opening malicious attachments or clicking on links that download and execute malware.
   - **Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)**: This involves exploiting a vulnerability in a web application, which can be less common in scenarios where the malware is described as rewriting itself to a user-specific folder like %Temp%.

Given the context and the commonality of phishing as an initial access technique, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
