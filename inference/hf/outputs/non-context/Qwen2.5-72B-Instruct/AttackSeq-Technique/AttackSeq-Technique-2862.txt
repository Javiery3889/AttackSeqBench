### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Suckfly's Nidiran backdoor communicates with C&C domains and sends encrypted and hardcoded information such as the network name and operating system details.
   - The focus is on the exfiltration of the victim's data off the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence on a compromised system to avoid detection. It does not directly relate to data exfiltration.
   - **B: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - This technique involves using webhooks to exfiltrate data. While it is a form of exfiltration, it is not typically associated with C&C communication.
   - **C: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
     - This technique involves manipulating process relationships to hide the presence of malicious processes. It does not directly relate to data exfiltration.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communication. This aligns well with the scenario where the backdoor communicates with C&C domains and sends data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a backdoor communicating with C&C domains and sending data. This is a clear indication of exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) do not directly relate to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
