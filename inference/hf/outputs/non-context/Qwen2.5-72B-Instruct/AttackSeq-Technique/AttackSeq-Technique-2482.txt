### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the adversaries:
1. Exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution.
2. Established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the adversaries established persistence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
  - This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which is typically used for initial access. However, the question already states that the initial access was achieved through the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability, so this is less likely to be the correct answer.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. This could be used to execute the malicious content and establish persistence, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite for the hijacked COM objects.

- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. The CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability is related to a client-side application (Microsoft Office), not a public-facing application. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

- **D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves checking for an internet connection, which is often done to ensure that the malicious content can communicate with a command and control server. This could be a plausible step before establishing persistence, as the adversaries might want to ensure they have a stable connection before proceeding.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access was achieved through the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability.
2. Before establishing persistence, the adversaries likely needed to ensure they had a stable internet connection to communicate with their command and control server.
3. The technique T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery fits this scenario as it involves checking for an internet connection, which is a logical step before executing malicious content and establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
