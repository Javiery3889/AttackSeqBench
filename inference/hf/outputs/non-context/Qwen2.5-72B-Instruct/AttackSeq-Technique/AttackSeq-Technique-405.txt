### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Excel file gains initial access, macros are enabled to construct a PE file, and then the Gholee malware uses `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe /C` for process execution while hiding its activity. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur before the `ShellExecute` command is executed.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**
  - DDE is a technique where malicious documents use dynamic data exchange to execute commands or download and execute malware. This is typically used in the initial stages of an attack, often in conjunction with macros, to execute commands or download additional payloads. However, it is not typically used after the PE file is constructed and before the `ShellExecute` command.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. Given that the question mentions the use of `cmd.exe /C` to execute the `ShellExecute` command, this technique is highly relevant. The `cmd.exe /C` command is a command-line interpreter that runs a command and then terminates, which aligns well with the described sequence.

- **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server (VPS)**
  - This technique involves the use of a VPS to host malicious infrastructure. While it is a common technique in the broader context of cyber attacks, it is not directly relevant to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the execution of commands on the victim's machine.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. While it is a common technique for maintaining communication with the attacker, it is not directly relevant to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the execution of commands on the victim's machine.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves the use of a malicious Excel file to gain initial access, the construction of a PE file using macros, and the execution of a command using `cmd.exe /C` to run `ShellExecute`.
- The most relevant technique in this sequence is the use of a command-line interpreter to execute the command, which is described by T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
- The other techniques (DDE, VPS, and Application Layer Protocol) are not as directly relevant to the specific sequence of events described.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
