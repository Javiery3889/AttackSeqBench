### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: Tortoiseshell achieved initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Initial access via a fake app.
  - Use of ‘bird.exe’ for discovery on the victim's machine.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network configurations. This is typically done after gaining initial access to understand the environment better.
  - **Relevance**: This could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access, but it is not the most immediate step.

- **Answer Choice B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualized environments and sandboxes, which are often used by security researchers to analyze malware.
  - **Relevance**: This is a common step after gaining initial access to ensure the malware can run without being detected, but it is not the most immediate step in the context of the question.

- **Answer Choice C: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to trick users into downloading and executing malware.
  - **Relevance**: This is a method of initial access, but the question already states that initial access was achieved by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website, not via email.

- **Answer Choice D: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**
  - This technique involves using DNS queries to gather information about the victim's network, such as domain names and IP addresses.
  - **Relevance**: This is a form of reconnaissance that can be performed before or after gaining initial access. However, it is not the most immediate step after gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The attackers tricked users into downloading a fake app from a fraudulent website.
- **Next Step**: After gaining initial access, the most immediate and logical step would be to gather information about the victim's host to understand the environment better before performing further actions like discovery with ‘bird.exe’.
- **Best Fit**: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information is the most plausible next step in this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
