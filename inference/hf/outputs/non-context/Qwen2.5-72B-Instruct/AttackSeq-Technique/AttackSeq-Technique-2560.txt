### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an adversary targeting the Taiwanese Government. The sequence includes:
1. Gathering information about the Taiwanese Government.
2. Using SSL encryption in their malware.
3. Utilizing Mocelpa's fake SSL handshake for defense evasion.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed the adversary to execute their plan after gathering information and before using the fake SSL handshake.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1553.002-Code Signing**
  - Code signing is used to sign malware to make it appear legitimate. This technique is typically used to bypass security checks and gain trust. However, it does not directly relate to the gathering of information or the use of SSL encryption.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - Web services can be used to host malicious content or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This technique could be relevant for gathering information or for setting up the infrastructure needed to use SSL encryption, but it is not the most direct fit for the described sequence.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick victims into providing sensitive information or to download malware. This technique is often used to gain initial access to a target network. After gathering information, the adversary might use phishing to deliver the malware that uses SSL encryption.

- **D: T1200-Hardware Additions**
  - Hardware additions involve physically adding hardware to a target's system. This technique is less likely to be used in the context of gathering information or using SSL encryption in malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gathering Information**: The adversary needs to gather information about the Taiwanese Government. This could involve reconnaissance techniques.
2. **Using SSL Encryption**: The malware uses SSL encryption to communicate securely with the C2 server.
3. **Fake SSL Handshake**: The adversary uses Mocelpa's fake SSL handshake to evade detection.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that fits between gathering information and using SSL encryption is **Phishing (T1566)**. Phishing is a common method to deliver malware and gain initial access to a target network, which aligns well with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
