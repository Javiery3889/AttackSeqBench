### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack:
1. Victims are redirected to an exploit landing page using JavaScript.
2. Attackers then persist by scheduling tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two events.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
  - This technique involves using a service (like email) to send spearphishing messages to victims. While this could be an initial vector to get the victim to the exploit landing page, it doesn't fit well with the sequence described, which starts with JavaScript redirection.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. This could be a plausible step after the victim is redirected to the exploit landing page, as the landing page might contain an exploit for a vulnerability in the victim's browser or another application.

- **C: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain command and control (C2) with the compromised system. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't fit well as the immediate next step after the victim is redirected to the exploit landing page.

- **D: T1656-Impersonation**
  - This technique involves impersonating a user or system to gain unauthorized access. This is not a likely step between the JavaScript redirection and the persistence mechanism.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack starts with JavaScript redirecting victims to an exploit landing page.
2. The next logical step would be to exploit a vulnerability on the victim's system to gain initial access.
3. After gaining initial access, the attackers can then set up persistence mechanisms, such as scheduling tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between the JavaScript redirection and the persistence mechanism is **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
