### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where Derusbi, after gathering system information, establishes communication with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP POST requests to a specific endpoint.
- The key TTPs mentioned are:
  - System Information Discovery (T1082)
  - Communication with C2 server via HTTP POST requests

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering system information, which is already mentioned in the question. However, it does not cover the communication with the C2 server.
- **Answer Choice B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves establishing a bidirectional communication channel with a C2 server. While it is relevant, it does not specify the use of HTTP POST requests.
- **Answer Choice C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**
  - This technique involves injecting code into processes using asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). It is not related to communication with a C2 server.
- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols, such as HTTP, to communicate with a C2 server. The specific use of HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp aligns well with this technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **System Information Discovery (T1082)**: This is the initial step where Derusbi gathers information about the victim's host.
2. **Communication with C2 Server**: The next step involves establishing communication with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The use of HTTP POST requests to communicate with the C2 server aligns with the **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)** technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
