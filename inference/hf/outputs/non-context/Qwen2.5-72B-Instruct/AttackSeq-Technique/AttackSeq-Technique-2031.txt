### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Duke group is using secure communication channels (encoded and encrypted HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with their C&C server. They then archive and transmit sensitive information using legitimate cloud services.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Secure communication with C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Archiving and transmitting sensitive information.
  - Using legitimate cloud services for exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a protocol other than the one intended by the application or service. While the Duke group is using HTTP/HTTPS, this choice does not fit the context of using legitimate cloud services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
  - This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of sensitive information using cloud services.

- **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over web services, which aligns with the use of legitimate cloud services. The Duke group is archiving and transmitting sensitive information using cloud services, which are often web-based.

- **Answer Choice D: T1585.003-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using cloud accounts to exfiltrate data. While this is relevant, it is more specific to the use of cloud accounts rather than the broader concept of exfiltration over web services.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The Duke group is using secure communication channels (HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with their C&C server.
  - They are archiving and transmitting sensitive information.
  - They are using legitimate cloud services for this exfiltration.
  - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** is the most appropriate choice because it specifically involves exfiltrating data over web services, which includes cloud services.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
