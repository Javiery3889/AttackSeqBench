### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with VBA macros to gain initial access and prompt for Outlook credentials.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial access to gather details about individuals with access to confidential information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves gathering information through phishing, which can include collecting personal or organizational details that can be used in subsequent attacks. This aligns well with the need to gather details about individuals before sending targeted spearphishing emails.
- **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**: This technique involves persistence by modifying the Winlogon Helper DLL. It is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is what FIN4 does with the spearphishing emails. However, the question specifically asks about the technique used to gather information before the phishing attack.
- **T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: This technique involves searching public websites for information about the victim. While this can be useful for gathering information, it is less targeted and less likely to provide the specific details needed for a spearphishing attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1598-Phishing for Information** is the most relevant technique for gathering detailed information about individuals before a targeted spearphishing attack.
2. **T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL** is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.
3. **T1566-Phishing** is the technique used for the actual spearphishing attack, not the information gathering phase.
4. **T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites** is a broader information gathering technique but is less likely to provide the specific details needed for a targeted spearphishing attack.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
