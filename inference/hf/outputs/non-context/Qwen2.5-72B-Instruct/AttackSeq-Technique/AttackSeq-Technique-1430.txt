### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor InkySquid. The key points are:
- Disguising exploit code within legitimate code.
- Restricting access to exploit code to evade automated detection.
- Leveraging cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API for their cyber operations.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1102-Web Service**
- **Description**: Adversaries may use legitimate web services to host and distribute tools, malware, or other payloads.
- **Relevance**: This technique aligns with the use of cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API, which can be considered a web service. It fits the context of leveraging cloud services for cyber operations.

**B: T1218.014-MMC**
- **Description**: Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to load malicious snap-ins or execute arbitrary code.
- **Relevance**: This technique is specific to the abuse of a local Windows tool and does not align with the use of cloud providers or web services.

**C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
- **Description**: Adversaries may obfuscate or encrypt data to avoid detection.
- **Relevance**: While this technique is relevant to the initial step of disguising exploit code, it does not specifically address the use of cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API.

**D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
- **Description**: Adversaries may compromise a website to deliver malicious content to victims when they visit the site.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more about compromising web pages to deliver malware, which is not directly related to the use of cloud providers for cyber operations.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Disguising Exploit Code**: This aligns with T1001-Data Obfuscation.
2. **Restricting Access to Evade Detection**: This is a general evasion technique and can be part of T1001-Data Obfuscation.
3. **Leveraging Cloud Providers**: This aligns with T1102-Web Service, as cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API are web services that can be used to host and distribute malicious content.

Given the context of leveraging cloud providers like Microsoft Graph API, the most relevant technique is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: A: T1102-Web Service**
