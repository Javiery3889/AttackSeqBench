### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about a technique that facilitates maintaining control of the compromised infrastructure through multiple communication stages, specifically in the context of the sequence of TTPs where data has been collected and is about to be exfiltrated.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1218.015 - Electron Applications**
  - This technique involves the use of Electron applications to execute malicious code. While it can be used for initial access or persistence, it does not specifically address maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

- **B: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain control over a compromised system. It is specifically designed to facilitate communication through different stages, which aligns well with the requirement of maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

- **C: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication channels, which can be used to maintain control. However, it is more focused on the nature of the communication (bidirectional) rather than the multiple stages of communication.

- **D: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. While it can be used for initial access, it does not specifically address maintaining control through multiple communication stages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The question focuses on maintaining control through multiple communication stages.
   - The technique should facilitate communication through different stages of the attack.

2. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1218.015 - Electron Applications**: Not specifically about maintaining control through multiple communication stages.
   - **B: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels**: Directly addresses maintaining control through multiple communication stages.
   - **C: T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication**: Focuses on bidirectional communication, not multiple stages.
   - **D: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**: Focuses on initial access, not maintaining control through multiple stages.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that aligns with maintaining control through multiple communication stages is **T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels**.

Final Answer: B: T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels
