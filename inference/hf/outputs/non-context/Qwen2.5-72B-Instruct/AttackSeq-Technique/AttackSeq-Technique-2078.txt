### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Whitefly) has already used tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials and facilitate credential access.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves moving laterally through compromised systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021.005-VNC**
  - VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote access technique that allows an attacker to control a remote system's desktop. This could be used for lateral movement, but it is not the most common or direct method after credential harvesting.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - OS Credential Dumping is the process of extracting credentials from the operating system. This technique is typically used to gain additional credentials, not to move laterally through the network. Since the question states that credentials have already been harvested, this is not the next logical step.

- **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to other systems. After harvesting credentials, an attacker would likely use these credentials to move laterally through the network. This is a logical next step in the attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - Internal Spearphishing involves tricking internal users into providing access or credentials. While this can be used for lateral movement, it is less direct and more time-consuming compared to using already harvested credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The attacker has already harvested credentials using tools like Mimikatz.
  - The next logical step is to use these credentials to move laterally through the network.
  - T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material is the most appropriate technique for this purpose, as it directly involves using stolen credentials to gain access to other systems.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
