### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where data is exfiltrated using a POST request to a C2 server.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves enumerating files and directories, particularly on the Desktop and user-specific folders.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
     - This technique involves manipulating the system's path environment to execute malicious code. It is not related to file and directory discovery.
   - **B: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique is used to identify connected peripheral devices such as USB drives, printers, and other hardware. It does not involve file and directory enumeration.
   - **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths, including those on the Desktop and user-specific folders. This aligns perfectly with the described attack sequence.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system, but it is not specifically about discovering files and directories.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the next step in the attack sequence is to enumerate files and directories, particularly on the Desktop and user-specific folders.
   - Among the given choices, **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is the most relevant and aligns directly with the described activity.
   - The other techniques (T1574.009, T1120, and T1119) do not specifically address file and directory enumeration.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
