### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Darkhotel APT group uses advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details. The goal is to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique best fits this context.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1608.001-Upload Malware**
  - This technique involves uploading malware to a victim's system. While this is a common tactic in many APT campaigns, it does not directly relate to maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure or compromising commercial resources.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While encryption is important for maintaining secure communication, it does not directly address the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

- **C: T1584.002-DNS Server**
  - This technique involves compromising DNS servers to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers. While this can be used to maintain a dynamic network infrastructure, it is more specific to DNS manipulation and does not fully capture the broader context of maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

- **D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves compromising infrastructure to support the attacker's operations. This can include compromising commercial resources, which aligns well with the need to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure. This technique is broad enough to encompass the various methods used to maintain such an infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance and Victim Identification**: The Darkhotel APT group uses advanced reconnaissance to identify victims' locations and stay details.
2. **Maintaining Infrastructure**: The goal is to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.
3. **Evaluating Techniques**:
   - **Upload Malware (T1608.001)**: Not directly related to maintaining infrastructure.
   - **Encrypted Channel (T1573)**: Important for secure communication but not for maintaining infrastructure.
   - **DNS Server (T1584.002)**: Specific to DNS manipulation, not broad enough for the context.
   - **Compromise Infrastructure (T1584)**: Broad and relevant to maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
