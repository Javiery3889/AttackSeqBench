### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where Office Macro Scripts have been successfully executed to load the Chinotto malware.
- **Objective**: Identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to evade detection and load the malware without alerting defenses.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sending a malicious file as an attachment in a spearphishing email.
  - **Relevance**: While spearphishing is a common initial infection vector, the question already states that the Office Macro Scripts have been executed. This technique is not relevant to the post-execution phase of evading detection.

- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using legitimate command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to execute malicious scripts, it does not specifically address evasion or loading malware without alerting defenses.

- **Answer Choice C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
  - **Description**: This technique involves loading executable code into memory without writing it to the disk, which can help evade detection by security software.
  - **Relevance**: Reflective code loading is a common method used to load malware into memory without touching the disk, which can help evade detection by antivirus and other security mechanisms. This aligns well with the objective of evading detection and loading the malware.

- **Answer Choice D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to evade detection, it typically involves modifying existing legitimate processes rather than loading malware directly into memory. It is less specific to the scenario of loading malware without alerting defenses.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question focuses on the post-execution phase where the malware needs to be loaded into memory without alerting defenses.
  - Reflective code loading (T1620) is a technique that directly addresses this need by loading the malware into memory without writing it to the disk, which is a common method to evade detection.
  - The other techniques (T1598.002, T1059, T1574) do not specifically address the evasion and loading of malware in the post-execution phase as effectively as T1620.

**Final Answer: C: T1620-Reflective Code Loading**
