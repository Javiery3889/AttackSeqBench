### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT) uses sandbox evasion techniques by delaying payload execution until a decoy Word document is closed.
   - After this, the RAT establishes communication with specific domains (pressmil[.]com and notebookhk[.]net).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Sandbox Evasion:** The RAT delays payload execution to avoid detection in a sandbox environment.
   - **Establish Communication:** The RAT then communicates with external domains.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
     - This is a plausible choice because after evading the sandbox, the RAT would need to establish a communication channel with the C2 server using a common protocol to avoid detection.

   - **B: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic.
     - While this could be used to avoid detection, it is not the primary technique for establishing communication after sandbox evasion.

   - **C: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malware or steal credentials.
     - This is not relevant to the sequence described, as the RAT has already been delivered and is now establishing communication.

   - **D: T1055.008-Ptrace System Calls:**
     - This technique involves using ptrace system calls to manipulate processes.
     - This is not relevant to the sequence described, as it does not involve establishing communication with external domains.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the RAT evades the sandbox, it uses a standard application layer protocol to establish communication with the C2 server.

### Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
