### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers use modules like 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to collect system information, including browser history and external IP addresses.
   - This information collection is part of the reconnaissance phase, specifically focusing on victim network discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
     - This technique involves identifying and exploiting trust relationships between network entities. While it is a valid reconnaissance technique, it is more specific to understanding trust relationships rather than general network information collection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials and other sensitive information. It is not related to the initial information gathering described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from the victim's network. While it is a valid technique, it is more relevant to the exfiltration phase, not the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns perfectly with the described use of 'Sysinfo' and 'Wnhttp' to gather system information, including browser history and external IP addresses.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically mentions the use of modules to collect a range of system information, which is a clear indication of network reconnaissance.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this activity is T1590-Gather Victim Network Information, as it directly pertains to the collection of information about the victim's network during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
