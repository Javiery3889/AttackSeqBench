### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Moafee and DragonOK groups used custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to maintain access to victim networks. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads using a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1554-Compromise Host Software Binary**
  - This technique involves modifying or replacing legitimate host software binaries to include malicious functionality. This could be used to maintain persistence and evade detection, but it doesn't directly relate to the initial access or the execution of payloads.

- **B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with links to malicious content. This is a common initial access vector, but it doesn't directly relate to the execution of payloads or the use of a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This is a broader category that includes various forms of phishing, including spearphishing. While it could be an initial access vector, it doesn't specifically address the execution of payloads or evasion techniques.

- **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or acquiring custom tools, such as backdoors and RATs, to support the attack. This aligns well with the scenario where the groups used custom-built backdoors and RATs. It also suggests that the development of these tools would precede their use in the attack, including the execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads and the use of a 'CPU core check' for evasion.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain access to victim networks.
2. The execution of 'CT/NewCT' payloads using a 'CPU core check' for evasion suggests a sophisticated and well-planned attack.
3. The development of these custom tools (T1587) is a logical step that would occur before their deployment and use in the attack.
4. The other options (T1554, T1566.002, and T1566) are more focused on initial access or specific techniques that don't directly relate to the development and use of custom tools.

**Final Answer: D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
