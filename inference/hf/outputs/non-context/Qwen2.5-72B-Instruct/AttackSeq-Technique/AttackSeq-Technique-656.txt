### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Gallmaker exploited the DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to execute commands in memory and gained initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Exploitation of the DDE protocol.
  - Execution of commands in memory.
  - Initial access to the victim's device using malicious Office documents.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for maintaining persistence or exfiltrating data, not for initial access or command execution.

- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
  - **Relevance**: After gaining initial access and executing commands in memory, the attacker would likely use a command and scripting interpreter to perform further actions on the victim's device.

- **Answer Choice C: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical media such as USB drives.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for data exfiltration, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle, not immediately after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice D: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using the DDE protocol to execute commands.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial access and command execution. It is not a subsequent step.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attack sequence described involves exploiting the DDE protocol to gain initial access and execute commands in memory.
  - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to use a command and scripting interpreter to perform further actions on the victim's device.
  - The other answer choices (A, C, and D) do not align as well with the immediate next steps in the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
