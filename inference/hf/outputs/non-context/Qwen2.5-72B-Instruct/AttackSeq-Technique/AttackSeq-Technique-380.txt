### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where cybercriminals use leaked-data search engines and forums to gather intelligence during the reconnaissance phase.
   - After this, they acquire new PoS (Point of Sale) and ATM skimmers, along with social engineering toolkits.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Use of leaked-data search engines and forums (SheYun, CnSeu) to gather intelligence.
   - **Acquisition Phase:**
     - Acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers.
     - Acquisition of social engineering toolkits.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1597-Search Closed Sources**
     - This technique involves searching closed sources for information, which aligns with the use of leaked-data search engines and forums. However, it does not cover the acquisition of tools and skimmers.
   - **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
     - This technique involves obtaining tools, capabilities, and resources to support the attack. This aligns well with the acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers, as well as social engineering toolkits.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms that start when the system boots or a user logs on. It does not align with the described sequence of reconnaissance and acquisition.
   - **D: T1584.005-Botnet**
     - This technique involves the use of botnets, which are networks of compromised devices. It does not align with the described sequence of reconnaissance and acquisition of specific tools and skimmers.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance Phase:**
   - The use of leaked-data search engines and forums (SheYun, CnSeu) is part of the reconnaissance phase, which is covered by T1597-Search Closed Sources.
2. **Acquisition Phase:**
   - The acquisition of PoS and ATM skimmers, along with social engineering toolkits, is best described by T1588-Obtain Capabilities.
3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While T1597-Search Closed Sources is relevant to the reconnaissance phase, the question specifically asks about the technique that occurred when the cybercriminals acquired new tools and skimmers.
   - T1588-Obtain Capabilities is the most appropriate choice as it directly addresses the acquisition of the necessary tools and resources.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
