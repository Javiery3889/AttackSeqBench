### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through document-based exploits, and the malware is executed using an updated MiniDuke loader. After this, CosmicDuke steals credentials from various software and exports certificates with private keys.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Document-based exploits
  - Execution: Updated MiniDuke loader
  - Credential Access: Stealing credentials from various software
  - Credential Access: Exporting certificates with private keys

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**
  - This technique involves modifying the password filter DLL to capture and log passwords. While this could be used to steal credentials, it is more specific to a particular method of credential theft and does not align well with the broader context of stealing credentials from various software and exporting certificates.

- **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from various password stores, such as web browsers, email clients, and other applications. This aligns well with the described attack sequence, where CosmicDuke steals credentials from various software.

- **Answer Choice C: T1553-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. While this could be used to maintain persistence or execute additional stages of the attack, it does not directly relate to the credential theft described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
  - This technique involves using one-way communication channels to exfiltrate data. While this could be used to send stolen credentials and certificates to a remote server, it does not directly relate to the credential theft itself.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attack sequence involves gaining initial access, executing malware, and then stealing credentials from various software and exporting certificates.
  - The most relevant technique for stealing credentials from various software is T1555-Credentials from Password Stores.
  - The other techniques (T1556.002, T1553, and T1102.003) do not directly align with the specific step of stealing credentials from various software.

**Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
