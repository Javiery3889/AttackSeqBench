### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before Gholee established communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired SSL certificate for HTTP GET and POST requests to /index.php.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves evading detection by checking if the malware is running in a virtualized or sandboxed environment. While this is a common initial step in many attacks, it is not directly related to establishing communication with a C2 server.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This is directly related to the described communication method (HTTP GET and POST requests).

- **C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
  - This technique involves the use of digital certificates, which can be used to establish secure communication. The question mentions an expired SSL certificate, which is a form of digital certificate. This technique is relevant to the communication method described.

- **D: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to communicate with a C2 server. This is not relevant to the described communication method, which uses HTTP over an expired SSL certificate.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** is not directly related to the communication method described.
2. **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is directly related to the use of HTTP for communication, but it does not specifically address the use of an expired SSL certificate.
3. **T1596.003-Digital Certificates** is directly related to the use of an expired SSL certificate, which is a key part of the communication method described.
4. **T1092-Communication Through Removable Media** is not relevant to the described communication method.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the use of an expired SSL certificate (T1596.003) occurred before the communication with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests.

**Final Answer: C: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
