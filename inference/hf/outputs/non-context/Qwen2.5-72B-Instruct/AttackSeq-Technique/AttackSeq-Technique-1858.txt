### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the VERMIN malware:
1. The malware executes and decrypts its embedded resource to continue running.
2. The malware then collects various system details, such as the machine name and local IP address, via WMI query.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up a mechanism to execute a payload when the system boots or a user logs on. This is typically used to ensure persistence, but it does not directly relate to the execution and decryption of an embedded resource or the collection of system details via WMI.

- **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the system's network configuration, which can include IP addresses, machine names, and other network-related details. This aligns well with the described action of collecting system details via WMI query.

- **C: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting content into a target's data or application. It is not related to the execution and decryption of an embedded resource or the collection of system details.

- **D: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and collecting information about cloud services. It is not related to the execution and decryption of an embedded resource or the collection of system details via WMI.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware executes and decrypts its embedded resource to continue running.
2. The malware then collects system details such as the machine name and local IP address via WMI query.
3. The technique that best fits the collection of system details via WMI query is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
