### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor BRONZE PRESIDENT. The key points are:
- BRONZE PRESIDENT developed its own remote access tools.
- They utilized PRC-linked infrastructure.
- They employed tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX for execution.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before they employed these tools.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1566-Phishing**
- Phishing is a technique used to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. This can be a common initial access vector.
- It is plausible that BRONZE PRESIDENT used phishing to gain initial access to the target network before deploying their remote access tools.

**B: T1606.001-Web Cookies**
- Web Cookies is a sub-technique under T1606 (Input Capture). It involves capturing web cookies to maintain access to web applications.
- This technique is more likely to be used after gaining initial access and is not typically a primary method for initial compromise.

**C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
- Compromise Software Supply Chain involves tampering with legitimate software to include malicious code.
- This is a sophisticated technique that can be used for initial access, but it is less common and more complex compared to phishing.

**D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
- Obtain Capabilities involves acquiring tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to support the attack.
- This technique is more about the preparation phase and is likely to occur before the actual deployment of tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The most common and straightforward method for initial access is phishing (T1566). Phishing can be used to trick users into downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can then be used to gain a foothold in the network.
2. **Preparation**: Before deploying tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX, the attackers would need to obtain and prepare these tools (T1588). This is a necessary step in the attack chain.
3. **Execution**: Once initial access is gained and the necessary tools are prepared, the attackers can then deploy and use these tools for further actions.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred before the deployment of Cobalt Strike and PlugX is the preparation phase, which is covered by T1588-Obtain Capabilities.

**Final Answer: D: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
