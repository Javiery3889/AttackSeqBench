### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malware named Sayad. The sequence includes:
1. Gathering information like system data and running processes.
2. Communicating with a C2 (Command and Control) server to upload encrypted data.
3. Capturing data specifically from removable media as part of its collection activities.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1125-Video Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing video from a device's camera. It does not align with the described activity of capturing data from removable media.

- **B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other portable storage devices. This aligns perfectly with the described activity of capturing data from removable media.

- **C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
  - This technique involves running a virtual instance to hide the presence of the malware or to perform actions in a controlled environment. It does not align with the described activity of capturing data from removable media.

- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While this might be used in the communication with the C2 server, it does not specifically address the collection of data from removable media.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question specifies that the malware captures data from removable media as part of its collection activities.
2. Among the given choices, only T1025-Data from Removable Media directly addresses this specific activity.
3. The other techniques (T1125, T1564.006, and T1027) do not align with the described activity of capturing data from removable media.

**Final Answer: B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
