### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The attackers have gained initial access to the victim network by exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
- **Objective**: The attackers are now looking to secure alternative means of access to maintain control over the compromised systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1657 - Financial Theft**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves stealing financial information, which is not directly related to securing alternative means of access.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice for the given context.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves creating scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at specific times, which can be used to maintain persistence.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible choice as it helps in maintaining access by ensuring that the malicious code runs periodically.

- **Answer Choice C: T1136 - Create Account**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves creating new user accounts, which can be used to maintain access to the system.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible choice as it provides a new, legitimate-looking account that the attackers can use to access the system.

- **Answer Choice D: T1598 - Phishing for Information**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is not directly related to securing alternative means of access.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice for the given context.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attackers have already gained initial access through an unpatched vulnerability.
  - To maintain control over the compromised systems, they need to secure alternative means of access.
  - **T1053.005 - Scheduled Task** and **T1136 - Create Account** are both techniques that can be used to maintain persistence.
  - **T1053.005 - Scheduled Task** is a common method for ensuring that malicious code runs periodically, which helps in maintaining access.
  - **T1136 - Create Account** is also a valid method, but creating a new account might be more detectable than a scheduled task.

- **Final Answer**: B: T1053.005 - Scheduled Task
