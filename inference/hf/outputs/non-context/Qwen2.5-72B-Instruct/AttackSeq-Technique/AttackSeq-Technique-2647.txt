### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker. The sequence includes:
1. Establishing command and control (C2) using FTP and HTTP.
2. Encrypting data with AES for transmission.
3. Exfiltrating data by copying it to removable drives when a specific file is present.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted protocol that is not the primary C2 channel. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the exfiltration method described is via removable drives, not over a network protocol.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen. While screen capture can be part of an attack, it does not align with the exfiltration method described in the question.

- **C: T1056.001-Keylogging**
  - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While keylogging can be part of an attack, it does not align with the exfiltration method described in the question.

- **D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical media, such as removable drives. This aligns perfectly with the exfiltration method described in the question, where data is copied to removable drives when a specific file is present.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes an attack sequence that includes establishing C2, encrypting data, and exfiltrating data via removable drives.
2. The exfiltration method described is specifically using physical media (removable drives).
3. Among the answer choices, only T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium aligns with this exfiltration method.

**Final Answer: D: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
