### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the Raccoon stealer:
1. The stealer is executed to collect data such as system information, account data, and crypto wallet details.
2. It bypasses blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the stealer bypassed blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel.

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code. While phishing could be the initial vector for delivering the Raccoon stealer, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described after the stealer is executed.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - Obfuscation is used to make code or data harder to understand, often to evade detection. This technique could be used to hide the stealer's code or the C&C server addresses. However, it does not directly relate to the network requests to a Telegram channel.

- **C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification**
  - This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to gain access or modify files. While it could be used to ensure the stealer has the necessary permissions to execute, it does not directly relate to the network requests to a Telegram channel.

- **D: T1010-Application Window Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering open application windows to gather information about the user's activities. While it could be used to gather additional data, it does not directly relate to the network requests to a Telegram channel.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the stealer making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses. This implies that the stealer needs to communicate with an external server to receive instructions.
- The most likely technique that would occur before this step is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**. This is because the stealer would need to obfuscate the C&C server addresses to avoid detection and ensure that the network requests are not easily intercepted or blocked.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
