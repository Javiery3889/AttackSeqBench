### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the TeamTNT threat group compromised an exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access. After gaining access, they deployed and executed a coin miner payload.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Compromising the exposed Weave Scope service.
  - Deployment and Execution: Deploying and executing a coin miner payload.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1648-Serverless Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves executing code in a serverless environment, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used for deploying and executing a coin miner payload on a compromised server. It is more relevant to cloud environments and serverless architectures.

- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute arbitrary commands and scripts.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the scenario. After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely use command-line interfaces to deploy and execute the coin miner payload.

- **Answer Choice C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**
  - **Description**: This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a running process.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used for various malicious activities, it is not typically the first step in deploying and executing a coin miner payload. It is more relevant to maintaining persistence or evading detection.

- **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - **Description**: This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports to identify potential targets.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to the initial reconnaissance phase before gaining access. It is not typically used after gaining initial access and deploying a payload.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers compromised the exposed Weave Scope service to gain initial access.
2. **Deployment and Execution**: After gaining access, the attackers would need to deploy and execute the coin miner payload.
3. **Relevance of T1059**: The most plausible technique for deploying and executing the coin miner payload is using a command-line interface or scripting interpreter, which is described by T1059.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
