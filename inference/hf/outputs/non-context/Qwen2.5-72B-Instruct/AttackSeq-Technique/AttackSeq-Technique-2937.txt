### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after Rocket Kitten utilized hard-coded IP addresses with GET requests from GHOLE malware as part of their C&C communication?
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Rocket Kitten**: A known APT group.
  - **GHOLE malware**: Malware used by Rocket Kitten.
  - **Hard-coded IP addresses**: Used for C&C communication.
  - **GET requests**: HTTP method used for communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding the true nature of files or information to evade detection. While this could be part of the malware's initial stages, it is not directly related to the C&C communication described.
  - **B: T1090.002-External Proxy**: This technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic. This could be used to mask the true origin of the C&C traffic, but it is not the most direct next step after using hard-coded IP addresses.
  - **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**: This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. This is more related to initial access or lateral movement, not directly to C&C communication.
  - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) for C&C communication. Given that the question mentions GET requests, this is the most relevant technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a scenario where Rocket Kitten uses hard-coded IP addresses and GET requests for C&C communication.
  - The use of GET requests implies that the malware is communicating over HTTP, which is an application layer protocol.
  - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most appropriate technique because it directly relates to the use of HTTP for C&C communication.
  - The other techniques (T1027, T1090.002, T1078) are not as directly relevant to the specific C&C communication method described.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
