### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where backdoors are installed as services capable of executing several malicious functions. The next step in the sequence is the backdoors connecting to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
  - This technique involves adversaries using chat messages to exfiltrate data or communicate. It is not typically used between the installation of backdoors and the connection to C2 servers.

- **B: T1055-Process Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process. While it can be used to maintain persistence or evade detection, it is not a necessary step between installing a backdoor and connecting to a C2 server.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with C2 servers. It is a common step after a backdoor is installed and before it connects to the C2 server to ensure that the communication is secure and not easily detected.

- **D: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
  - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate and gain access to resources. It is typically used for lateral movement and does not fit the context of the sequence described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Installation of Backdoors as Services**: The backdoors are installed as services capable of executing several malicious functions.
2. **Communication with C2 Servers**: The backdoors need to connect to C2 servers to receive commands.
3. **Encryption of Communication**: To ensure that the communication between the backdoors and the C2 servers is secure and not easily detected, the adversaries would likely use an encrypted channel.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that would occur between the installation of the backdoors and the connection to the C2 servers is the use of an encrypted channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
