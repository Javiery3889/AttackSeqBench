### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Babar's dropper reduces forensic artifacts by executing a command line through spawning a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from disk. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this action.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from keychain storage. It is not directly related to reducing forensic artifacts or executing commands to delete files.

- **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating system processes to execute malicious code when certain events occur. While this could be a method to initially execute the dropper, it does not directly relate to the action of deleting the dropper binary.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This is closely related to the action of deleting the dropper binary to reduce forensic artifacts. The deletion of the dropper binary is a form of hiding artifacts.

- **D: T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**
  - This technique involves smuggling malicious content within HTML files. It is not directly related to the action of deleting the dropper binary.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Action**: The dropper reduces forensic artifacts by executing a command line to delete the dropper binary from disk.
2. **Evaluate Techniques**:
   - **T1555.001-Keychain**: Not related to deleting files.
   - **T1546-Event Triggered Execution**: Could be related to initial execution but not to deleting the dropper.
   - **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: Directly related to reducing forensic artifacts by deleting the dropper binary.
   - **T1027.006-HTML Smuggling**: Not related to deleting files.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique that occurred before the dropper deletes itself is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
