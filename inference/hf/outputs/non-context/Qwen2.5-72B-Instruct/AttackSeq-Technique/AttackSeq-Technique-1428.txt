### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of Internet Explorer users through specific CVEs (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) during a strategic web compromise of the Daily NK website.
   - The sequence also mentions leveraging the Microsoft Graph API for command and control within the BLUELIGHT malware.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred after the exploitation and before the command and control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
     - This technique involves using trusted developer utilities to execute malicious code. It is typically used to bypass security mechanisms and execute code with elevated privileges. However, it is not a common next step after exploitation and before command and control.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. The question already mentions the exploitation of Internet Explorer users, so this technique is not a subsequent step.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. It is a common step after gaining initial access to the system to ensure the attacker's presence remains undetected. This fits well between the exploitation and the command and control phase.
   - **D: T1003.003-NTDS**
     - This technique involves stealing the NTDS.dit file to extract password hashes. While this is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not typically a step taken before establishing command and control.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The exploitation of Internet Explorer users through CVEs (CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411) is the initial access vector.
   - After gaining access, the attacker would likely want to hide their presence to avoid detection.
   - Hiding artifacts (T1564) is a logical step to take before establishing command and control through the Microsoft Graph API.
   - The other techniques (T1127, T1190, and T1003.003) do not fit as well into the sequence described.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
