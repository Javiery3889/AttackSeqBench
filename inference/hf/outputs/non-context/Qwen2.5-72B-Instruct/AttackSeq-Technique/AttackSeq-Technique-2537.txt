### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The attacker used fake Japanese documents to gain initial access.
2. The malware then retrieved encrypted C&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497.001-System Checks**
  - This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions before executing the malware. While this could be a part of the initial access phase, it doesn't directly lead to retrieving C&C configuration information.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up the malware to execute automatically at boot or logon. This is more relevant to persistence and ensuring the malware remains active, but it doesn't directly relate to retrieving C&C configuration information.

- **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts to gain access or escalate privileges. While this could be part of the initial access phase, it doesn't directly lead to retrieving C&C configuration information.

- **D: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using web services to communicate with the C&C server. This is the most relevant technique because it directly involves retrieving information from web-based sources, such as blogs or microblogs, which aligns with the described step of retrieving encrypted C&C configuration information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker gains initial access using fake Japanese documents.
2. The malware needs to communicate with the C&C server to retrieve encrypted configuration information.
3. The most logical step between gaining initial access and retrieving C&C configuration information is using a web service to communicate with the C&C server.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

- Initial Access (using fake Japanese documents)
- T1102-Web Service (to retrieve encrypted C&C configuration information)

Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service
