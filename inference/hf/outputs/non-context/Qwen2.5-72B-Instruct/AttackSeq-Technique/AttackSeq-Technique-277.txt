### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where VBA code within an external template decrypts data from a malicious Microsoft Word document and drops it into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in this sequence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripting languages to execute commands and scripts. Given that the VBA code has dropped a PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1'), it is highly likely that the next step would be to execute this script using a command-line interpreter.

- **B: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. While this could be a subsequent step, it is less likely to be the immediate next step after dropping the files. The immediate next step would more likely involve executing the dropped script.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with remote systems. While this could be used to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server, it is not the most immediate next step after dropping the files.

- **D: T1562.012-Disable or Modify Linux Audit System**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying the Linux audit system. This is highly specific to Linux systems and does not align with the context of a Windows-based attack involving a Microsoft Word document and PowerShell script.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The VBA code within the external template decrypts data from the malicious Microsoft Word document.
2. The decrypted data is dropped into files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.
3. The most logical next step would be to execute the dropped PowerShell script ('fmx.ps1') to carry out further malicious activities.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible next step is to use a command-line interpreter to execute the dropped script.

**Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
