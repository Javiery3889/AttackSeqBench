### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events:
1. Users are redirected to advertising pages or compromised sites.
2. These sites execute RIG exploits via malvertising.
3. RIG Exploit Kit (EK) runs an obfuscated PowerShell script.
4. The PowerShell script fetches malware from the Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1648-Serverless Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code without the need for a traditional server. It is not directly related to the sequence of events described, where a PowerShell script is used to fetch malware from a C&C server.

- **B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute code. This aligns with the initial step where RIG EK exploits a vulnerability via malvertising to run the PowerShell script.

- **C: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves acquiring tools or capabilities to support the attack. While this could be relevant in a broader context, it does not specifically describe the sequence of events where a PowerShell script fetches malware from a C&C server.

- **D: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
  - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one. This is not directly related to the sequence of events described, where a PowerShell script is used to fetch malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step involves users being redirected to compromised sites that execute RIG exploits via malvertising.
2. RIG EK exploits a vulnerability in a client application to run an obfuscated PowerShell script.
3. The PowerShell script fetches malware from the C&C infrastructure.

The most relevant technique in this sequence is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution** because it directly describes the exploitation of a client application to execute the PowerShell script, which then fetches the malware.

**Final Answer: B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
