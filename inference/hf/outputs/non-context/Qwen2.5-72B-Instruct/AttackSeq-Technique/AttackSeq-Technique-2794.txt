### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the XAgent app collects sensitive information from an iOS device and then uploads this data to a Command and Control (C2) server using FTP. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitates the uploading of files via FTP to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, typically through social engineering. It does not directly relate to the uploading of files via FTP.

- **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
  - This technique involves using a large number of IP addresses to rapidly change the DNS records of a domain, making it harder to track the C2 server. While it can be used to obfuscate the location of the C2 server, it does not directly facilitate the uploading of files via FTP.

- **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. It is not directly related to the process of uploading files via FTP.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment. While it is more about bringing files into the environment, it can also be used to describe the process of uploading files to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The XAgent app collects information and needs to upload it to a C2 server via FTP.
  - The technique that most closely aligns with the process of transferring files to a C2 server is T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
  - While T1105 is typically used for bringing files into the environment, it can also be interpreted as the transfer of files out of the environment to a C2 server, which is the reverse process.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
