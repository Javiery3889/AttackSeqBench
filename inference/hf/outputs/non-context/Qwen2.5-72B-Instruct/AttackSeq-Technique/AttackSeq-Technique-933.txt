### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a malicious macro in an Office Excel document is used for initial access.
   - After the macro is executed, a PowerShell script decodes and writes malicious content to the %TEMP% directory.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Malicious macro in an Office Excel document.
   - Execution: PowerShell script decodes and writes malicious content to the %TEMP% directory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up a program to run automatically when the system boots or the user logs on.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the question does not mention any boot or logon actions.

   - **B: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange**
     - This technique involves using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute commands or scripts.
     - While DDE can be used to execute commands, it is not typically used to write content to the %TEMP% directory. It is more about inter-process communication.

   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
     - This fits the sequence described, as the PowerShell script is used to decode and write malicious content to the %TEMP% directory.

   - **D: T1055.009-Proc Memory**
     - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a running process.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the question does not mention any process injection.

### Final Reasoning

- The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the malicious macro is executed, a PowerShell script is used to decode and write the malicious content to the %TEMP% directory.
- The technique that best aligns with this sequence is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

### Final Answer

Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
