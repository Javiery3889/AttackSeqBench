### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where victims are redirected to compromised websites, and scripts or HTML smuggling techniques are used for malware delivery. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial redirection and malware delivery.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1567.003 - Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is typically a later stage in an attack after the initial compromise and data collection. It is not likely to occur immediately after the initial redirection and malware delivery.

- **B: T1566 - Phishing**
  - This is a broad category of techniques used to trick victims into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. While phishing can lead to the initial compromise, it is not a technique that would occur after the victims are already redirected to compromised websites and malware is delivered.

- **C: T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user, which is a common post-compromise activity. After the initial malware delivery, the attacker would likely want to gather information about the compromised system and its users to further their attack.

- **D: T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link**
  - This is a specific type of phishing where the attacker sends a targeted email with a malicious link. While it can be used to initiate an attack, it is not a technique that would occur after the initial redirection and malware delivery.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial stage of the attack involves redirecting victims to compromised websites and using scripts or HTML smuggling techniques to deliver malware.
- After the malware is delivered, the attacker would likely want to gather information about the compromised system and its users.
- The most plausible technique to occur after the initial malware delivery is **T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery**
