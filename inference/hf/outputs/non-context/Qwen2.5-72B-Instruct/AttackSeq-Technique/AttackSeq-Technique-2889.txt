### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After using discovery techniques to query registry values and manipulate thread contexts, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred for establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols?
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Discovery techniques (querying registry values, manipulating thread contexts)
  - Establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic. While it can be used for communication, it is not specifically about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

- **Answer Choice B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
  - This technique involves disrupting network availability. It is not related to establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. HTTP and HTTPS are application layer protocols, making this a strong candidate.

- **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about establishing communication using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Techniques**:
   - Querying registry values and manipulating thread contexts are discovery techniques used to gather information about the system and its environment.
2. **Establishing Communication**:
   - After gathering information, the next logical step is to establish communication with a remote system.
3. **HTTP and HTTPS Protocols**:
   - HTTP and HTTPS are application layer protocols used for communication over the internet.
4. **Relevant ATT&CK Technique**:
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique because it specifically involves using application layer protocols like HTTP and HTTPS for communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
