### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by GreyEnergy operators. The key points are:
- Use of modular malware with partial AES-256 encryption.
- Fileless execution techniques.
- Only selected modules are used on specific targets for increased stealth.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

#### A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
- This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system.
- While this could be a part of the initial access phase, it does not directly align with the use of modular malware, fileless execution, or the selective use of modules for stealth.

#### B: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling
- This technique involves using LNK files to hide malicious content by smuggling icons.
- This is more related to initial infection vectors and does not align well with the described use of modular malware and fileless execution.

#### C: T1071.001-Web Protocols
- This technique involves using web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
- While this could be used in the context of modular malware, it does not directly address the use of fileless execution or the selective use of modules for stealth.

#### D: T1564-Hide Artifacts
- This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection.
- This aligns well with the use of fileless execution and the selective use of modules to maintain stealth. Fileless execution and selective module usage are both methods to hide the presence of the malware and reduce the footprint on the target system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Analysis**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs that involve modular malware, fileless execution, and selective module usage for stealth.
2. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A**: Exploitation of Remote Services is more about gaining initial access and does not align with the described stealth techniques.
   - **B**: LNK Icon Smuggling is about initial infection vectors and does not align with the described stealth techniques.
   - **C**: Web Protocols for C2 communication is a relevant technique but does not directly address the use of fileless execution or selective module usage.
   - **D**: Hide Artifacts aligns well with the use of fileless execution and selective module usage to maintain stealth.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the described attack, is the use of techniques to hide artifacts to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
