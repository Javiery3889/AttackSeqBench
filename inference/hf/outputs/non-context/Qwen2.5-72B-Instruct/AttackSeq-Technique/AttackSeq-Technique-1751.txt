### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG1021.
   - They used compromised domain credentials to access shared folders.
   - They dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.
   - The goal was to compromise additional servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Compromised Domain Credentials:** This suggests the use of T1078-Valid Accounts.
   - **Access Shared Folders:** This suggests the use of T1135-Network Share Discovery and T1087-Account Discovery.
   - **Dropped NodeIISWeb Web Shell Loader via SMB:** This suggests the use of T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer and T1035-Service Execution.
   - **Compromise Additional Servers:** This suggests the use of T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:** This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. While it could be used in the attack, it is not the most likely next step after dropping a web shell loader.
   - **B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model:** This technique involves using DCOM for remote access. While it could be used for lateral movement, it is not the most likely next step after dropping a web shell loader.
   - **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols:** This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. It is not directly related to the next logical step in the attack sequence.
   - **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services:** This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to additional systems. This is the most logical next step after dropping a web shell loader and accessing shared folders, as it aligns with the goal of compromising additional servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
