### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where malware has made a POST request to a C2 domain (judystevenson[.]info).
- The next step in the attack sequence involves the transfer of additional tools or payloads to communicate with 13 identified C2 domains.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**: This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) to communicate with a C2 server. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not typically used for transferring additional tools or payloads.
- **B: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**: This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to maintain access. It is not related to the transfer of tools or payloads.
- **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves the transfer of additional tools or payloads to the victim's network. This aligns well with the scenario described, where additional tools or payloads are being transferred to communicate with multiple C2 domains.
- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a victim's system. It is not relevant to the transfer of tools or payloads after initial C2 communication has been established.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware has already made a POST request to a C2 domain, indicating that initial communication has been established.
2. The next step involves transferring additional tools or payloads to communicate with multiple C2 domains.
3. Among the given options, T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) is the most relevant technique for this step in the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
