### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information during the Discovery phase. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next during the Collection phase.
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1113-Screen Capture
  - B: T1056-Input Capture
  - C: T1564.002-Hidden Users
  - D: T1057-Process Discovery

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1113-Screen Capture**:
  - **Description**: Captures the contents of the screen, which can include sensitive information displayed on the screen.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to collect visual information that may be useful for the attacker, such as login screens, sensitive documents, or user interactions.

- **T1056-Input Capture**:
  - **Description**: Captures user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information like passwords and credentials.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is useful for collecting credentials and other sensitive data entered by the user.

- **T1564.002-Hidden Users**:
  - **Description**: Creates hidden user accounts to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more related to maintaining access and persistence rather than collecting data.

- **T1057-Process Discovery**:
  - **Description**: Discovers running processes to understand the system's state and identify potential targets.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to the Discovery phase rather than the Collection phase, as it helps in understanding the system but does not directly collect data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: The Aria-body backdoor has already gathered extensive system information, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
2. **Collection Phase**: The next logical step is to collect specific data that can be exfiltrated or used to further the attacker's objectives.
3. **Evaluating Techniques**:
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** and **T1056-Input Capture** are both relevant to the Collection phase as they directly involve gathering data.
   - **T1564.002-Hidden Users** and **T1057-Process Discovery** are less relevant to the Collection phase, as they are more focused on maintaining access and understanding the system, respectively.
4. **Choosing the Most Plausible Technique**:
   - **T1113-Screen Capture** is a common technique used to gather visual information, which can be highly valuable for the attacker.
   - **T1056-Input Capture** is also a strong candidate, but screen capture can provide a broader range of information, including visual context that might be missed by input capture alone.

**Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture**
