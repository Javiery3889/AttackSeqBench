### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) fetches malware from a Command and Control (C&C) infrastructure using an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - The malware is transmitted securely, encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** RIG EK fetches malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - **Transmission Method:** The malware is transmitted using an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - **Security Measure:** The transmission is encrypted using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. The question specifically mentions that the exploit code is transmitted securely and encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, which aligns with this technique.
   - **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
     - This technique involves using legitimate protocols or services to blend in with normal network traffic. While this could be used to avoid detection, it does not specifically address the encryption of the communication.
   - **C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for executable files to execute a malicious payload. It is not related to the secure transmission of data.
   - **D: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of the C2 traffic. While it can be used to avoid detection, it does not specifically address the encryption of the communication.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **RIG EK Fetches Malware:**
   - The initial step involves the RIG EK fetching malware from the C&C infrastructure.
2. **Obfuscated PowerShell Script:**
   - The malware is fetched using an obfuscated PowerShell script, which is a common method to avoid detection.
3. **Encrypted Transmission:**
   - The malware is transmitted securely, encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. This is a clear indication of the use of an encrypted channel to protect the C2 communication.

### Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
