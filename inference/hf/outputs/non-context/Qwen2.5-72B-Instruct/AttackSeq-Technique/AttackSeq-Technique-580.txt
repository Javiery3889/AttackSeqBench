### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:
1. Exploiting a vulnerability in SharePoint to install the AntSword webshell.
2. Achieving credential access using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
3. Assessing the content of the compromised system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system. After gaining access and dumping credentials, it is logical for the attacker to explore the file system to understand the environment and identify valuable data.

- **B: T1055-Process Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into processes to evade detection or to execute code in the context of another process. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after gaining access and dumping credentials.

- **C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - This technique involves discovering cloud account information. This is not relevant to the described scenario, which focuses on a local system compromise.

- **D: T1036.006-Space after Filename**
  - This technique involves using a space after a filename to hide files or executables. While this could be used for stealth, it is not a typical immediate action after gaining access and dumping credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has already exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint to install a webshell and used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
2. The next logical step would be to understand the environment and identify valuable data, which aligns with the technique of discovering file and directory paths.
3. Among the given choices, T1083-File and Directory Discovery is the most plausible next step.

**Final Answer: A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
