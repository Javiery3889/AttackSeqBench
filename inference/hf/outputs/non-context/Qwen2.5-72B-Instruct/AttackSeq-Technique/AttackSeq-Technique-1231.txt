### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Inception attackers first exploited CVE-2017-11882 for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, they established persistence using a Run key and a PowerShell script located at `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. However, the question already states that the initial access was gained through CVE-2017-11882, which is a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Office, not a public-facing application. Therefore, this choice is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. This is a broad category that could include various actions, such as running PowerShell scripts, which is mentioned in the persistence step.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1059.005-Visual Basic**
     - This sub-technique involves using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to execute commands. While VBA is a scripting language, the question does not mention the use of VBA specifically. Instead, it mentions a PowerShell script.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1218.014-MMC**
     - This sub-technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute commands. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as there is no mention of using MMC.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through CVE-2017-11882, the attackers used a command and scripting interpreter (PowerShell) to establish persistence.
   - The PowerShell script mentioned in the persistence step aligns with the T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
