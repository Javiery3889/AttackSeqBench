### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Lazarus group gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - The key points are:
     - The attack involves the Lazarus group.
     - The initial access method is spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not typically used as an initial access method but rather for lateral movement within a network.
     - This does not align with the described attack sequence.

   - **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves sending phishing emails to gain initial access. It is a broad category that includes various types of phishing, including spear-phishing.
     - This aligns well with the described attack sequence, as the initial access was through spear-phishing emails.

   - **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering the network configuration of a system, which is typically done after gaining initial access to understand the environment.
     - This does not align with the described attack sequence, as it would occur after initial access.

   - **Answer Choice D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
     - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to conduct spear-phishing. While it is a form of spear-phishing, the question specifically mentions emails containing malicious Word documents.
     - This does not align as well with the described attack sequence, as the initial access was through email, not voice.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before gaining initial access is T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
