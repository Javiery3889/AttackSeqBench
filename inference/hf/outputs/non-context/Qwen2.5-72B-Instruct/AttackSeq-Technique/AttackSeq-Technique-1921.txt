### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10:
1. APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement across the network.
2. APT10 staged data for exfiltration in multi-part archives and compressed them in locations like the Recycle Bin.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the lateral movement and before the data staging and compression.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)**
  - DCOM is a technique used for lateral movement. Since the question already mentions that APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement, this technique is likely to have occurred before the data staging and compression, not after.

- **B: T1602.001-SNMP (MIB Dump)**
  - SNMP (MIB Dump) is a technique used to gather information from network devices. This technique is not directly related to data staging or exfiltration and is more about reconnaissance. It is less likely to occur after lateral movement and before data staging.

- **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves compressing and archiving data before exfiltration. This aligns perfectly with the description in the question where APT10 staged data for exfiltration in multi-part archives and compressed them in locations like the Recycle Bin. This is the most plausible technique to occur after lateral movement and before exfiltration.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used for initial access and is typically one of the first steps in an attack. It is not likely to occur after lateral movement and before data staging and compression.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. APT10 used systems sharing access and credentials for lateral movement.
2. After gaining access to the target systems, APT10 would need to collect and prepare the data for exfiltration.
3. The most logical next step is to compress and archive the collected data, which is described by T1560-Archive Collected Data.

**Final Answer: C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
