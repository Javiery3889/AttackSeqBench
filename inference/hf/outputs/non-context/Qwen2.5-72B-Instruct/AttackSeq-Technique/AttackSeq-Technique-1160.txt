### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where PROMETHIUM uses its C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure to communicate over HTTPS with self-signed certificates. The next step in the attack sequence involves sending encoded archives containing collected documents to the C2 server.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - C2 communication over HTTPS with self-signed certificates.
  - Sending encoded archives containing collected documents to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1565.002 - Transmitted Data Manipulation**
  - This technique involves altering data in transit to evade detection or to manipulate the data itself. While this could be relevant in some scenarios, it does not directly describe the act of exfiltrating data.

- **Answer Choice B: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2 communications. This aligns well with the scenario where collected documents are sent to the C2 server over the HTTPS channel.

- **Answer Choice C: T1011 - Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium**
  - This technique involves using a different network medium for exfiltration, such as email or FTP. This does not fit the scenario where the data is exfiltrated over the same HTTPS C2 channel.

- **Answer Choice D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel for C2 communications. While the C2 communication is over HTTPS (which is encrypted), this technique does not specifically describe the exfiltration of data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The scenario describes the use of a C2 infrastructure over HTTPS to exfiltrate encoded archives containing collected documents.
  - The most relevant technique that describes exfiltration over the same C2 channel is T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
  - The other techniques (T1565.002, T1011, and T1573) do not directly describe the exfiltration of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: B: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
