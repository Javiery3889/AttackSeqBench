### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware SectorB06.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Manipulating file ownership using `CreateProcess`.
     - Deleting initial traces such as `winword.exe`.
     - Achieving persistence by adding malicious files to the registry run keys.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**
     - This technique involves adversaries using file or path exclusions to prevent security software from scanning specific files or directories. This does not align with the described actions of manipulating file ownership or deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves adversaries using native APIs to interact with the operating system. The use of `CreateProcess` to manipulate file ownership and delete traces aligns well with this technique.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1057-Process Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering running processes to understand the environment. While this might be a preliminary step, it does not directly align with the described actions of manipulating file ownership or deleting traces.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves adversaries using the `at` command to schedule tasks. This does not align with the described actions of manipulating file ownership or deleting traces.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware SectorB06 is described as using `CreateProcess` to manipulate file ownership and delete initial traces. This aligns with the use of native APIs, which is covered by T1106.
   - The other techniques (T1564.012, T1057, and T1053.002) do not directly match the described actions.

**Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API**
