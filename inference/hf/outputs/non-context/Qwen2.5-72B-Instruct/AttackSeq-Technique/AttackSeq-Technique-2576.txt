### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. An attacker uses a malicious Word document containing VBA-Macro functions to execute code.
2. The attacker then obfuscates a JavaScript payload to hinder analysis.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain elevated privileges or to bypass security mechanisms. It is not directly related to the execution of code or the obfuscation of a payload.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to deliver a malicious payload. While phishing might be the initial vector for delivering the malicious Word document, it does not describe what happens after the VBA-Macro executes code.

- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using legitimate command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts. After the VBA-Macro executes code, it is plausible that the attacker would use a command or scripting interpreter to further execute the obfuscated JavaScript payload.

- **D: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves using the "at" command to schedule tasks. While this could be used to schedule the execution of a payload, it is not the most direct step after the VBA-Macro executes code.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. The attacker uses a malicious Word document with VBA-Macro functions to execute code.
2. After the VBA-Macro executes code, the next logical step is to use a command or scripting interpreter to further execute the obfuscated JavaScript payload.
3. The most relevant technique for this step is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
