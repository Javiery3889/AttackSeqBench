### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the GreyEnergy malware after compromising a computer. The actions include using Nmap and Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator privileges, and then performing lateral movement using tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Compromise using GreyEnergy mini
  - Using Nmap and Mimikatz to gain domain admin privileges
  - Lateral movement using PsExec and WinExe

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user and service accounts to gain access to systems. While obtaining domain admin privileges is a form of gaining valid accounts, this choice does not specifically address the lateral movement aspect.

- **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to move laterally within a network. PsExec and WinExe are both tools that can be used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a form of remote service. This choice aligns well with the described lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice C: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves tricking internal users into providing access or information. It does not fit the context of using tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice D: T1546.003-Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying WMI event subscriptions to execute code. It is not related to lateral movement using PsExec or WinExe.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a sequence where the attacker has already gained domain admin privileges using Nmap and Mimikatz.
  - The next step is to perform lateral movement, which is the process of moving from one system to another within the network.
  - PsExec and WinExe are tools specifically designed for remote execution, which is a form of remote service.
  - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK technique for this scenario is T1021-Remote Services.

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
