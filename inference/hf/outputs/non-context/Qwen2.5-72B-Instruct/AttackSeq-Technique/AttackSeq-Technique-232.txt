### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a multi-step process where a threat actor group uses batch files to decode and deploy additional malicious payloads. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to facilitate the delivery of the malicious documents to victim organizations.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1137.006-Add-ins**: This technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code. While this can be a method for executing code, it is not typically used for the initial delivery of malicious documents to victim organizations.

- **B: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**: This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain to deliver malicious components. This is a sophisticated and less common method for delivering malware and is not typically used for the initial delivery of documents.

- **C: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves abusing mechanisms that control elevation of privileges. This is more relevant to post-exploitation activities and not the initial delivery of malicious documents.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious documents. Phishing is a common and effective method for delivering malware to victim organizations. It often involves tricking users into opening malicious emails or clicking on malicious links, which can lead to the execution of batch files and the deployment of additional payloads.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Delivery**: The question focuses on the initial delivery of malicious documents to victim organizations.
2. **Common Methods**: Phishing (T1566) is a widely used and effective method for delivering malware.
3. **Relevance**: Phishing aligns with the scenario of tricking users into opening malicious documents, which can then lead to the execution of batch files and the deployment of additional payloads.
4. **Other Techniques**: The other techniques (T1137.006, T1195.003, T1548) are either not commonly used for initial delivery or are more relevant to post-exploitation activities.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
