### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where BlueDelta accessed credentials using vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - The specific vulnerability mentioned is CVE-2020-35730.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the attackers gained initial access by exploiting this vulnerability.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2020-35730.
   - **Next Step:** The question asks what technique likely followed this initial access.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code. This is typically used to gain initial access, not after gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain access to credentials. This aligns well with the scenario where BlueDelta accessed credentials using the Roundcube vulnerability.
   - **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain:**
     - This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malicious code. This is not relevant to the scenario of accessing credentials after gaining initial access.
   - **D: T1552.007-Container API:**
     - This technique involves exploiting container APIs to gain access to sensitive information. This is not directly related to accessing credentials after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2020-35730 in Roundcube webmail software.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to exploit the vulnerability to access credentials, which aligns with T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access.
   - The other techniques (T1203, T1195.002, and T1552.007) do not fit the sequence as well as T1212.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1212-Exploitation for Credential Access
