### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor BlueDelta.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward incoming emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
     - Exfiltrating data by automating the process.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs can be broken down as follows:
     1. **Collection**: Creating a filter to forward emails.
     2. **Exfiltration**: Automating the exfiltration process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves hiding the nature of the files or information to avoid detection. It does not fit the sequence of collecting and exfiltrating emails.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automating the process of exfiltrating data. This fits the second part of the sequence where the data is exfiltrated by automating the process.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1048.002-Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an encrypted protocol that is not used for command and control (C2). While this could be a method of exfiltration, it does not specifically address the automation aspect mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1543.004-Launch Daemon**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying a launch daemon to achieve persistence. It does not fit the sequence of collecting and exfiltrating emails.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Collection**: Creating a filter to forward emails (T1114-Email Collection).
     2. **Exfiltration**: Automating the exfiltration process (T1020-Automated Exfiltration).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration
