### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The pro-democracy activists received a targeted phishing email containing a link to a RAR archive.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: The question implies that the initial TTP is a phishing attack (T1566).

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This is the initial TTP mentioned in the question. It describes the phishing email that was sent to the activists.
- **Answer Choice B: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
  - This technique involves persistence mechanisms where an attacker ensures that a malicious program runs automatically when a user logs in. This is a post-compromise technique and would occur after the initial phishing attack.
- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This is the same as Answer Choice A and describes the initial phishing attack.
- **Answer Choice D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves manipulating network traffic to evade detection or to communicate with a command and control server. This is also a post-compromise technique and would occur after the initial phishing attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial TTP**: The activists received a targeted phishing email (T1566).
2. **Post-Phishing TTPs**:
   - **T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: This would occur after the initial phishing attack, once the attacker has gained access to the system and wants to ensure persistence.
   - **T1205-Traffic Signaling**: This would also occur after the initial phishing attack, once the attacker has established a foothold and needs to communicate with a command and control server.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after the initial phishing attack would be a technique that ensures persistence or establishes communication with the attacker's infrastructure. However, the question specifically asks for the technique that occurred **after** the phishing email was received, which implies a post-compromise technique.

**Final Answer: B: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
