### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the ZeroT malware:
1. ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography.
2. ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. The question specifically mentions HTTP POST beacons, not mail protocols. Therefore, this choice is not relevant.

- **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access to resources. The question does not mention any identity or access management issues. Therefore, this choice is not relevant.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. The question mentions that ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons, which aligns with the use of an encrypted channel. Therefore, this choice is relevant.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system. The question does not mention any phishing activities. Therefore, this choice is not relevant.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes ZeroT retrieving stage-2 payloads via steganography and then transmitting system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.
2. The relevant ATT&CK technique for encrypted communication is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
3. The other answer choices (T1071.003-Mail Protocols, T1556.007-Hybrid Identity, and T1566-Phishing) do not align with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
