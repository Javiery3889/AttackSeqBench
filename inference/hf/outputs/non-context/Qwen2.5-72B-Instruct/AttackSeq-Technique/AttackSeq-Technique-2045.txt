### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Reconnaissance**: The attackers used fake personas on social media to gather information.
- **Initial Access**: The attackers sent spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**: This technique involves using stolen credentials or other authentication materials to gain access. This is typically used after initial access has been gained, not before.
- **T1003.007 - Proc Filesystem**: This technique involves collecting credentials from the file system. This is a post-compromise technique and does not fit the sequence of events described.
- **T1587.001 - Malware**: This technique involves using malware to gain initial access. While this could be a method of initial access, the question specifically mentions spear-phishing with links to fake pages, which is a different technique.
- **T1585 - Establish Accounts**: This technique involves creating or using existing accounts to gain access. This fits well with the sequence described, as the attackers might use the information gathered during reconnaissance to create or establish accounts that they can use to send spear-phishing messages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: The attackers used fake personas on social media to gather information about their targets.
2. **Establish Accounts (T1585)**: Using the information gathered, the attackers might create or establish accounts that appear legitimate to the targets.
3. **Initial Access**: The attackers then send spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to these targets, leveraging the established accounts to increase the likelihood of success.

**Final Answer: D: T1585-Establish Accounts**
