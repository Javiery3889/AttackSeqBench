### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has deployed multiple variants of a custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts for potential data collection. The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with the attacker's servers and download additional payloads.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is a common method for establishing communication and downloading additional payloads.

- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While this can be used to evade detection, it is not the primary method for establishing communication and downloading payloads. It is more about the specific port used rather than the protocol.

- **C: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - This technique involves using container orchestration jobs to schedule tasks. This is not relevant to the described scenario of establishing communication and downloading payloads.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves using scheduled tasks or jobs to execute commands at specific times. While this can be used to maintain persistence, it is not the primary method for establishing communication and downloading payloads.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has deployed a VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts for data collection.
- The next logical step is to establish communication with the C2 server to download additional payloads.
- Among the given choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique for establishing communication and downloading payloads using standard protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
