### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before T9000 communicated with a C2 server via encrypted traffic using a binary protocol over a specific port. The key points to consider are:
- The communication is encrypted.
- It uses a binary protocol.
- It occurs over a specific port.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves the use of encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. It is a common practice to encrypt traffic to avoid detection by network security tools.
  - This technique aligns well with the scenario where T9000 communicates with a C2 server via encrypted traffic.

- **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
  - This technique involves using DNS to perform calculations or to exfiltrate data. It is not directly related to the establishment of an encrypted C2 channel.
  - This technique does not fit the scenario as well as T1573.

- **C: T1123-Audio Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing audio from a microphone. It is not related to the establishment of a C2 channel or the encryption of traffic.
  - This technique is not relevant to the scenario.

- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over an existing C2 channel. It assumes that the C2 channel is already established.
  - While this technique is related to C2 communication, it is more about the exfiltration phase, which typically occurs after the C2 channel is established.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the use of encryption for C2 communications.
2. **T1568.003-DNS Calculation** is not directly related to the establishment of an encrypted C2 channel.
3. **T1123-Audio Capture** is not related to C2 communication or encryption.
4. **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** is a subsequent step that occurs after the C2 channel is established.

### Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel
