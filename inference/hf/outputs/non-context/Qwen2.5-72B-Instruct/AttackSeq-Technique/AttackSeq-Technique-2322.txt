### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary used Cobalt Strike's built-in abilities, including SMB and PsExec, for Lateral Movement to deploy beacons on additional systems within the victim's network.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine what technique likely occurred after the lateral movement but before the collection of data from information repositories and user mailboxes for exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Lateral Movement using Cobalt Strike's SMB and PsExec.
   - **Next Step:** (To be determined)
   - **Final Step:** Data Collection and Exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement, which is not relevant to the scenario described, as the lateral movement was already performed using SMB and PsExec.
   - **B: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions**
     - This technique involves adding email delegate permissions, which is typically used to gain access to email accounts. This could be a step in the data collection phase but is not a logical next step immediately after lateral movement.
   - **C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. While this could be a method for lateral movement, the question already states that lateral movement was performed using SMB and PsExec.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a logical step after gaining access to additional systems via lateral movement. It is a common next step before exfiltrating data from information repositories and user mailboxes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the adversary used Cobalt Strike for lateral movement, they would collect data from the local systems they have accessed. This aligns with the typical attack flow where adversaries first establish a foothold and then gather information before exfiltration.

### Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System
