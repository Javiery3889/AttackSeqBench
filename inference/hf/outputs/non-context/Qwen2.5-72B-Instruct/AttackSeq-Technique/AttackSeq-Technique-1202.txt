### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Energetic Bear gained initial access to Turkish critical infrastructure through a watering hole attack by compromising a supply chain website. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supply chain to gain access to the target. This aligns well with the scenario where a supply chain website was compromised to set up the watering hole attack.

- **B: T1187-Forced Authentication**
  - This technique involves forcing users to authenticate to a service controlled by the attacker. This does not fit the scenario of a watering hole attack through a compromised supply chain website.

- **C: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**
  - This technique involves using LNK files to execute malicious code. This is more related to post-compromise activities and does not fit the initial access scenario described.

- **D: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is a more specific and different type of supply chain compromise. The scenario mentions a supply chain website, not hardware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The scenario describes a watering hole attack where a supply chain website was compromised.
2. The initial access was gained through this compromised website.
3. The technique that best fits this scenario is T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, as it involves compromising a third-party supply chain to gain access to the target.

**Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
