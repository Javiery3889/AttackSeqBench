### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial step involves establishing communication with a C2 server using HTTP connections and specific URIs like `<c2-domain>/login.php`.
   - The next step involves transferring stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the command and control infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, but it does not describe the exfiltration of data. It is a technique used to gather data, not to transfer it.
   - **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the primary C2 channel. However, the question specifies that the data is transferred over the C2 channel, not a different protocol.
   - **C: T1563.002-RDP Hijacking**
     - This technique involves hijacking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, which is not relevant to the exfiltration of data over a C2 channel.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control communication. This aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question, where data is transferred to the C2 infrastructure using the established HTTP connections.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where data (keystrokes and screenshots) is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communication.
   - The most appropriate ATT&CK technique that matches this scenario is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
