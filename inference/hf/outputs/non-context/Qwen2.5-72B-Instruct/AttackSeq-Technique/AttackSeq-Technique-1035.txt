### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Emissary Panda.
   - The sequence starts with **Active Scanning** to identify systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144.
   - The sequence ends with gaining initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
     - This technique involves searching for publicly available information on websites or domains. It is typically used for reconnaissance and gathering information before an attack. However, it does not fit well between active scanning and gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a target. It is often used for command and control (C2) communication after gaining access, not between scanning and gaining initial access.
   - **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique is already mentioned in the question as the first step. It involves scanning for vulnerabilities, which is what Emissary Panda did to identify systems with CVE-2017-0144. Therefore, it cannot be the technique that occurred after active scanning.
   - **D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. It is typically used for persistence and execution of malicious activities after gaining access, not between scanning and gaining initial access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Active Scanning (T1595)**: Emissary Panda identifies systems with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144.
     2. **Exploitation for Initial Access (T1210.002)**: Emissary Panda exploits CVE-2019-0604 on Microsoft SharePoint servers to gain initial access.
   - None of the provided answer choices fit perfectly between these two steps, but the closest and most logical choice is **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This could be used to communicate with the identified vulnerable systems before exploiting them, although it is more commonly used for C2 communication after gaining access.

However, given the context and the options provided, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
