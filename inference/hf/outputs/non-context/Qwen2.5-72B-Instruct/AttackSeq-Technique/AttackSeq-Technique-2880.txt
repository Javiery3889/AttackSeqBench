### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. A dropper malware delivers the main Bisonal payload.
2. The dropper malware establishes persistence by creating a registry entry for boot or logon autostart execution.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is typically a step that occurs after the initial payload is delivered and persistence is established, but it is not the most immediate next step.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique is already mentioned in the question as the method used to establish persistence. Therefore, it cannot be the next step.

- **C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves establishing bidirectional communication with a C2 server. This is a logical next step after the payload is delivered and persistence is established, as the malware would need to communicate with the attacker's server to receive further instructions.

- **D: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
  - This technique involves adding a public key to the authorized_keys file to gain persistent access to a system via SSH. This is not typically a next step after delivering a payload and establishing persistence via a registry entry.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The dropper malware delivers the Bisonal payload.
2. The dropper malware creates a registry entry to ensure the payload runs at boot or logon.
3. The next logical step would be for the malware to establish communication with the C2 server to receive further instructions.

Given the options, the most plausible next step is establishing bidirectional communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
