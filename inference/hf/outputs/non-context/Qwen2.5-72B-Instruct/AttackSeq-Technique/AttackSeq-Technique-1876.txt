### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells on victim networks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1596.004-CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**
  - This technique involves using CDNs to host and deliver malicious content. While it can be used to deliver payloads, it is not typically a precursor to initial access through web shells. It is more about the delivery mechanism rather than the initial compromise.

- **B: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**
  - This technique involves manipulating the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) registry key to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. This is more about persistence and execution within a compromised system, not about initial access.

- **C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system to the victim network. This typically occurs after initial access has been established, as the attacker needs a foothold to transfer files.

- **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, network topology, and system configurations. This is often a reconnaissance step that occurs before the initial access to understand the target environment and identify potential entry points.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access Context**: The question specifies that FIN13 established initial access through the exploitation of external servers by leveraging consistent gateways like web shells.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Before exploiting external servers, the attacker would need to gather information about the victim's network to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.
3. **Technique Alignment**: T1590 (Gather Victim Network Information) aligns with the reconnaissance phase, which is a necessary step before the initial access through web shells.

**Final Answer: D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
