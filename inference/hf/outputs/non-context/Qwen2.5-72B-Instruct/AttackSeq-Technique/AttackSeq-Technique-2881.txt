### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the Bisonal malware:
1. The malware evaded defenses using an RC4 cipher with a specific key to encrypt its C2 (Command and Control) address strings.
2. The malware used hardcoded values for the initial HTTP POST connection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. Given that the malware used an HTTP POST connection, this technique is highly relevant.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code through deceptive emails or messages. While phishing can be an initial vector for malware, the question focuses on the malware's communication with the C2 server, not the initial infection vector.

- **C: T1021.004-SSH**
  - This technique involves using SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access. The question does not mention any use of SSH for communication or remote access, so this is not relevant.

- **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to evade detection. While this could be relevant if the malware was using a tunneling protocol, the question specifically mentions the use of HTTP POST, which is a common application layer protocol, not a tunneling protocol.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware used an RC4 cipher to encrypt its C2 address strings.
2. The malware used hardcoded values for the initial HTTP POST connection.
3. The use of HTTP POST for communication aligns with the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
