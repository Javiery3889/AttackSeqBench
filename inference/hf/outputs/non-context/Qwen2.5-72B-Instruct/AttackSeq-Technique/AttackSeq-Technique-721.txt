### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves checking for an active internet connection. While it could be useful for the implant to ensure it can communicate with the control server, it is not a necessary step between ensuring persistence and communicating with the control server.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting to execute commands. This could be relevant if the implant needs to execute additional commands or scripts to set up the communication with the control server.
   - **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system's network configuration. This could be useful for the implant to understand the network environment before attempting to communicate with the control server.
   - **D: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves manipulating network protocols to intercept and relay authentication requests. This is more relevant to network attacks and does not fit well into the sequence of ensuring persistence and communicating with the control server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The implant has already ensured persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     - Before communicating with the control server, it would be logical for the implant to gather information about the system's network configuration to ensure it can successfully establish communication.
     - Therefore, the most plausible technique that would occur between ensuring persistence and communicating with the control server is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**.
   - **Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
