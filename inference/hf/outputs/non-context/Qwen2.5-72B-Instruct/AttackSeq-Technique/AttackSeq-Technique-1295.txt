### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe` to maintain the Poison Ivy server process. The next step in the sequence involves securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Persistence**: Injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe` to maintain the Poison Ivy server process.
  - **Communication**: Securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1621 - Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves generating requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to bypass or manipulate MFA systems. It is not relevant to securing communication or establishing persistence.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice B: T1090 - Proxy**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary to hide the true source or destination of the traffic. While it can be used to secure communication, it does not specifically mention the use of a custom network protocol over TCP.
  - **Evaluation**: Less plausible compared to other choices.

- **Answer Choice C: T1546 - Event Triggered Execution**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code when certain events occur, such as system boot or user logon. It is related to persistence but not to securing communication.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit. It is directly relevant to securing communication, especially when using a custom network protocol over TCP.
  - **Evaluation**: Most plausible choice.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already established persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe`.
  - The next step involves securing communication using a custom network protocol over TCP.
  - Among the given choices, T1573 (Encrypted Channel) is the most relevant technique for securing communication, as it involves using encryption to protect data in transit.
  - The other choices (T1621, T1090, and T1546) do not align as closely with the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
