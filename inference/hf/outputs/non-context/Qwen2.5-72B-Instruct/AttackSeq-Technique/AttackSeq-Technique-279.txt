### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a base64 encoded PowerShell script is decoded and executed from a file named 'sdmc.jpg'.
- The focus is on the technique used to hinder detection and conceal the malicious components before proceeding to the command and control phase.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves manipulating the system's path to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to concealing or obfuscating the script itself.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves encoding or encrypting data to make it difficult to detect or analyze. Base64 encoding is a form of obfuscation, which aligns with the scenario of decoding a base64 encoded script.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control server. While it is a valid technique, it is more relevant to the command and control phase, not the execution phase.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. It is not related to concealing or obfuscating the script during the execution phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes the use of a base64 encoded PowerShell script, which is a form of obfuscation.
- The goal is to hinder detection and conceal the malicious components before proceeding to the command and control phase.
- Among the given choices, **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** is the most relevant technique, as it directly addresses the use of obfuscation to hide the script.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
