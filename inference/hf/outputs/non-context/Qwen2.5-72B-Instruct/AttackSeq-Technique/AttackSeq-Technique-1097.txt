### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus Group:
  - Use of system utilities like `net user` and `systeminfo.exe` to collect user and network information.
  - Use of the SMBMap utility to collect user and network information.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred next, specifically focusing on discovering shared resources within the network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021.005-VNC**
  - This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access. It is not directly related to discovering shared resources within the network.
- **Answer Choice B: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying device drivers on the system. It is not related to discovering shared resources within the network.
- **Answer Choice C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network shares, which aligns with the use of SMBMap to collect user and network information. SMBMap is specifically designed to map and interact with SMB (Server Message Block) shares, making this the most plausible next step.
- **Answer Choice D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting identity information about the victim, which is not directly related to discovering shared resources within the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Lazarus Group used `net user` and `systeminfo.exe` to gather user and network information.
- They then used SMBMap, which is a tool specifically designed to map and interact with SMB shares.
- The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to discover network shares to identify potential targets for further exploitation.
- Among the given choices, T1135-Network Share Discovery is the most relevant and plausible next step.

**Final Answer: C: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
