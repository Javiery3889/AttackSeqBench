### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Hellsing APT group has achieved Command and Control (C2) by connecting their backdoor to a command server.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this to grant them Initial Access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's environment. This is typically used after gaining initial access to the system, not before.
- **T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**: This technique involves manipulating the dynamic linker to execute malicious code. This is a post-exploitation technique used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges, not to gain initial access.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or deploying malware. Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question is asking about the technique used to gain initial access to the system.
2. **Phishing (T1566)**: Phishing is a common method for gaining initial access. It involves tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments, which can lead to the deployment of a backdoor or other malware.
3. **Other Techniques**:
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This is used after gaining initial access to transfer additional tools.
   - **T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking**: This is used for post-exploitation and persistence, not initial access.

### Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing
