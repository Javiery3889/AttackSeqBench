### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first uses defense evasion techniques, specifically self-deletion on a hardcoded date to avoid detection.
   - After evading detection, the malware then collects detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1070-Indicator Removal**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. While this is a defense evasion technique, it does not align with the collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting detailed information about the system, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions. This aligns perfectly with the described reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not describe the collection of system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information from the browser, such as cookies and history. While it is a form of information discovery, it is more specific to browser data and does not cover the broader system information described in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware first uses defense evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - After evading detection, it collects detailed information about the system, which is a clear indication of the System Information Discovery technique (T1082).
   - The other answer choices do not align as closely with the described sequence of events.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
