### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method using CVE 2014-0515 via a watering hole attack.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur to maintain communication with the compromised systems after the initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: CVE 2014-0515 via a watering hole attack (T1189 - Drive-by Compromise).
   - Post-Initial Access: Maintain communication with the compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1219 - Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves using legitimate or custom remote access software to maintain persistent access to a system. This is a common method for maintaining communication after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1078.001 - Default Accounts**
     - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for initial access, it is less likely to be the primary method for maintaining communication after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1219 - Remote Access Software**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice A, so it is also a valid option.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique is used for initial access, not for maintaining communication after the initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved via a watering hole attack (T1189 - Drive-by Compromise).
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker needs to maintain communication with the compromised system.
   - The most common and effective method for maintaining communication is using remote access software (T1219 - Remote Access Software).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1219-Remote Access Software
