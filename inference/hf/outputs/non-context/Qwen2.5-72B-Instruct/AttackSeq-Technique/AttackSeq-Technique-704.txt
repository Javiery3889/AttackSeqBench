### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor TA505:
1. Deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
2. Maintenance of access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1059.009-Cloud API**
  - This technique involves using cloud service APIs to execute commands. The question does not mention any cloud services or APIs, so this is not relevant.

- **B: T1505.004-IIS Components**
  - This technique involves using IIS components to maintain access. The question does not mention IIS or web server components, so this is not relevant.

- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to maintain access. The question mentions hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler, which is a method of creating a scheduled task or job. This is a strong candidate.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. The question does not mention any public-facing applications or initial access, so this is not relevant.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands**:
   - This is an initial access and execution technique, but it is not the focus of the question.

2. **Maintenance of access by hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler**:
   - Hijacking RegIdleBackup and altering its associated COM handler is a method of creating a scheduled task or job to maintain persistence.
   - This aligns with the T1053-Scheduled Task/Job technique.

### Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
