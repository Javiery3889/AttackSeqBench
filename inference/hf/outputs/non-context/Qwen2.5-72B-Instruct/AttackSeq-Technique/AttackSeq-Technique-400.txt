### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions involving the creation and execution of a malicious PE (Portable Executable) file using concatenated ASCII character codes. The focus is on the technique used to hide the malware's activities from analysis by debuggers and sandboxes.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to make them more difficult to understand. This can include encoding, encryption, or other forms of obfuscation. Given that the malware uses concatenated ASCII character codes, this suggests a form of obfuscation to hide the true nature of the PE file.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with remote systems. This is not directly related to hiding activities from debuggers and sandboxes.

- **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forks, which are a feature of the macOS file system, to store additional data. This is not relevant to the described scenario, which involves a PE file and ASCII character codes.

- **D: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - This technique involves deploying a container to run malicious code. This is not related to hiding activities from debuggers and sandboxes.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the use of concatenated ASCII character codes to create and execute a malicious PE file.
2. The focus is on hiding the malware's activities from analysis by debuggers and sandboxes.
3. Among the given choices, T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is the most relevant because it involves altering the appearance of files or information to make them more difficult to understand, which aligns with the use of ASCII character codes to obfuscate the PE file.

**Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
