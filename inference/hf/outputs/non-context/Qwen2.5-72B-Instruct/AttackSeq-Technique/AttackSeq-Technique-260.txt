### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker abuses Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling to avoid detection.
- **Key TTPs**: The focus is on the initial access phase, specifically the technique used to compromise external remote services.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1055.013 - Process Doppelg√§nging**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating a malicious process that appears to be a legitimate process by manipulating the process creation process.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more related to process manipulation and evasion, not initial access or compromising external remote services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1078.001 - Default Accounts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using default accounts that come with software, systems, or services.
  - **Relevance**: This could be relevant to initial access, but it is not specifically tied to compromising external remote services.

- **Answer Choice C: T1620 - Reflective Code Loading**
  - **Description**: This technique involves loading a malicious payload directly into memory without touching the disk.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about execution and evasion, not initial access or compromising external remote services.

- **Answer Choice D: T1133 - External Remote Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using valid accounts to connect to external remote services, such as SSH, RDP, or VNC.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is directly related to the initial access phase and specifically involves compromising external remote services, which aligns with the context of the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker uses Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
  - The initial access phase involves compromising external remote services.
  - Among the given choices, T1133 (External Remote Services) is the most relevant because it directly involves using valid accounts to connect to external remote services, which is a common initial access technique.
  - The other choices (T1055.013, T1078.001, and T1620) are more related to process manipulation, default accounts, and reflective code loading, which are not as directly relevant to the initial access phase described in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1133 - External Remote Services**
