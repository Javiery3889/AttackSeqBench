### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events involving TDrop2 malware.
- The malware retrieved a second-stage payload disguised as an image file to evade security mechanisms.
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred during the reconnaissance phase to collect information about specific paths on the infected system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1020-Automated Exfiltration**: This technique involves automatically exfiltrating data from the victim's system. It is not related to reconnaissance or discovering file paths.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on the victim's system. This is directly related to reconnaissance and collecting information about specific paths.
- **T1069.002-Domain Groups**: This technique involves discovering domain groups and their members. It is more related to network and domain reconnaissance rather than file and directory discovery.
- **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves obfuscating data to evade detection. It is not related to reconnaissance or discovering file paths.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about collecting information about specific paths on the infected system during the reconnaissance phase.
- **T1083-File and Directory Discovery** is the most relevant technique because it directly involves discovering file and directory paths, which is a common reconnaissance activity.
- The other techniques (T1020, T1069.002, and T1001) do not align with the specific requirement of discovering file paths.

**Final Answer: B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
