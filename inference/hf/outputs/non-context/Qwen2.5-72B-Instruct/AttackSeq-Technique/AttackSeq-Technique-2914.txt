### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an APT group (APT15) has gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the deployment of backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**
  - This technique involves credential dumping from Unix-like systems. Since the question mentions gaining domain administrator credentials, which are typically associated with Windows environments, this choice is not relevant.

- **Answer Choice B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not directly related to gaining credentials or deploying backdoors. This choice is not relevant to the sequence described.

- **Answer Choice C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. This is a plausible step before deploying backdoors.

- **Answer Choice D: T1027.009-Embedded Payloads**
  - This technique involves embedding payloads within files or other data to evade detection. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of gaining credentials and deploying backdoors.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, which is a tool for OS credential dumping (T1003).
- After gaining these credentials, the next logical step would be to deploy backdoors such as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.
- Therefore, the most plausible technique that occurred before deploying the backdoors is OS Credential Dumping (T1003).

**Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
