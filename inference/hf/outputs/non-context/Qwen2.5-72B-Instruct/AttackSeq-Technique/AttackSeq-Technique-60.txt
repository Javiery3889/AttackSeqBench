### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the ScarCruft group:
1. Phishing emails with malicious Office documents.
2. Execution of Office Macro Scripts.
3. Utilization of DLL Side-Loading for defense evasion.

We need to determine which MITRE ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between the execution of Office Macro Scripts and the utilization of DLL Side-Loading.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1584.005-Botnet**
  - This technique involves the use of a botnet, which is a network of compromised devices. It is not typically a step that occurs between the execution of a macro and the use of DLL Side-Loading. It is more related to the command and control (C2) phase of an attack.

- **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible step before DLL Side-Loading, as it involves altering the way programs run, which is a common precursor to side-loading.

- **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**
  - This technique involves using scripting languages like AutoHotKey and AutoIT to execute commands. While these scripts can be used to automate tasks, they are not typically used as a direct precursor to DLL Side-Loading.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules, which are pre-compiled libraries that can be loaded into a process. This is closely related to DLL Side-Loading, as DLL Side-Loading involves loading a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one. However, it is more of a technique used in conjunction with DLL Side-Loading rather than a step that occurs before it.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Phishing emails with malicious Office documents** lead to the execution of **Office Macro Scripts**.
2. After the macro scripts are executed, the attacker needs to maintain control and potentially load additional malicious components.
3. **Hijack Execution Flow (T1574)** is a logical step because it allows the attacker to modify the execution flow of legitimate programs, which can then be used to load a malicious DLL.
4. **DLL Side-Loading** is then used to load the malicious DLL, which helps in evading defenses.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurs before DLL Side-Loading is **Hijack Execution Flow (T1574)**.

**Final Answer: B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
