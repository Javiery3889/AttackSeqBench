### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where spear-phishing emails or strategic web compromises are used to gain initial access.
   - After gaining access, customized Poison Ivy server code is executed on the target system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails or strategic web compromises (T1566).
   - Execution: Customized Poison Ivy server code is executed on the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
     - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for lateral movement or remote command execution. It is typically used after initial access and execution to move laterally within the network or execute commands remotely.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
     - This technique involves leveraging trusted relationships, such as those between organizations, to gain access. It is not directly related to the execution of malware on a target system.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code when certain events occur, such as system boot or user logon. It is a plausible next step after gaining initial access and executing malware, as it can ensure persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. It is the initial step in the attack sequence described, not the step that occurs after gaining access and executing malware.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing or strategic web compromises (T1566), the attacker would execute the Poison Ivy server code on the target system.
   - The next logical step would be to ensure persistence, which can be achieved through event-triggered execution (T1546).

### Final Answer: C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution
