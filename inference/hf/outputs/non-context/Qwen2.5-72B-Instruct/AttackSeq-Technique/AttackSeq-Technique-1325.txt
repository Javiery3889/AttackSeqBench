### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CosmicDuke malware. Specifically, it mentions that CosmicDuke conducts discovery by searching for files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames.
- **Objective**: Determine the next ATT&CK technique that would logically follow this discovery phase to gather more information from the victim's system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a specific time or in response to certain events.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for persistence and execution, it is not directly related to gathering information from the victim's system after file discovery.

- **Answer Choice B: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing data from the clipboard, which can include sensitive information that the user has copied.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about capturing user interactions and sensitive data, but it is not a direct follow-up to file discovery.

- **Answer Choice C: T1547.006-Kernel Modules and Extensions**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying or creating kernel modules and extensions to achieve persistence and privilege escalation.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about maintaining persistence and gaining higher privileges, not about gathering information from the victim's system.

- **Answer Choice D: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or screen recordings to gather visual information from the victim's system.
  - **Relevance**: After discovering files, an attacker might want to gather more detailed information about the system, such as the current state of the user interface, which can be achieved through screen capture.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After discovering files, the attacker would likely want to gather more detailed information about the system to understand the context and environment.
3. **Screen Capture**: Capturing the screen can provide visual information about the system, such as open applications, user activities, and other relevant details.

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
