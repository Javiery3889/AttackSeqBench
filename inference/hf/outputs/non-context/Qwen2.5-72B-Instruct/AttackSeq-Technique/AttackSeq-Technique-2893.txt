### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where a malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' is delivered.
- After delivery, a Downloader 1 is used to execute another executable.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled the execution step after the delivery of the malicious Excel document.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and deliver malicious content. While it can be used for delivery, it doesn't directly enable the execution of the downloaded content.
- **T1012-Query Registry**: This technique involves querying the Windows registry to gather information. It is not directly related to the execution of downloaded content.
- **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without the need for a traditional server. It is more about running code in a cloud environment, which doesn't fit the context of a malicious Excel document and a downloader.
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Excel) to execute arbitrary code. This fits the context of a malicious Excel document being used to execute a downloader.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Delivery of the Malicious Excel Document**: The document 'Circular.xls' is delivered to the target.
2. **Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203)**: The Excel document contains a vulnerability that, when exploited, allows the execution of arbitrary code.
3. **Execution of Downloader 1**: The exploited vulnerability is used to execute Downloader 1, which then downloads and executes another executable.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that enabled the execution step after the delivery of the malicious Excel document is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
