### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Elderwood Group gained initial access to target organizations, including Google, and then used masqueraded SSL connections for backdoor communications.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access
  - Masqueraded SSL connections for backdoor communications

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading**
  - **Description**: Masquerading involves renaming or modifying the attributes of files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate or benign.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used after gaining initial access to blend in with legitimate processes and avoid detection. However, it is not typically the next step after initial access but rather a technique used to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

- **Answer Choice B: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
  - **Description**: Exploitation for client execution involves using vulnerabilities in client applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients) to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to gain initial access to a system. Since the question states that initial access has already been gained, this technique is less likely to be the next step.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - **Description**: Malicious File involves tricking users into opening a file that contains malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to gain initial access by tricking users into executing malware. Since initial access has already been gained, this technique is less likely to be the next step.

- **Answer Choice D: T1590.002-DNS**
  - **Description**: DNS involves using DNS requests to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used after gaining initial access to establish communication with a C2 server. It is a plausible next step before using masqueraded SSL connections for backdoor communications.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The Elderwood Group has already gained initial access to the target organizations.
2. **Next Step**: The next logical step would be to establish a communication channel with a C2 server to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
3. **Masqueraded SSL Connections**: After establishing the communication channel, the group uses masqueraded SSL connections to further obfuscate their activities.

**Final Answer: D: T1590.002-DNS**
