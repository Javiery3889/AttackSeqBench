### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence involves:
1. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) with the capability to keylog and steal Outlook passwords.
2. The use of the DNS protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1055.015 - ListPlanting**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying a list of files or directories to be processed by another program.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to keylogging, stealing passwords, or setting up C2 communication. It is more about manipulating file lists, which doesn't fit the context of the question.

- **B: T1113 - Screen Capture**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen to gather information.
  - **Relevance**: While screen capture can be useful for gathering information, it is not a necessary step between keylogging and setting up C2 communication. It is more of an additional data collection method.

- **C: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using protocols other than the standard ones (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant because it involves exfiltrating data (such as stolen passwords) using an alternative protocol. DNS is a common alternative protocol used for C2 communication and data exfiltration. This fits well with the sequence described in the question.

- **D: T1125 - Video Capture**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing video from the victim's system.
  - **Relevance**: Similar to screen capture, video capture is a method for gathering information but is not a necessary step between keylogging and setting up C2 communication. It is more of an additional data collection method.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The RAT has the capability to keylog and steal Outlook passwords.
2. The attacker needs to exfiltrate the stolen passwords to their command and control server.
3. The DNS protocol is used for C2 communication, which can also be used for data exfiltration.

Given the sequence, the most logical step between keylogging and using DNS for C2 communication is exfiltrating the stolen data using an alternative protocol like DNS.

**Final Answer: C: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
