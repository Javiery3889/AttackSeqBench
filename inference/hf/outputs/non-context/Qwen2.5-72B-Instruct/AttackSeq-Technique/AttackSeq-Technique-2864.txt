### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Suckfly group:
1. They used the Nidiran back door.
2. They used hacktools signed with stolen digital certificates to infect internal hosts.
3. They scanned the internal network for open ports to expand their foothold.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between the infection of internal hosts and the scanning of the internal network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering cloud services and applications. It is not typically used immediately after infecting internal hosts and before scanning the network. It is more relevant in the context of cloud environments.

- **B: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
  - This technique involves stealing chat messages. It is not a common step in the sequence of actions described, which focuses on gaining and expanding access within a network.

- **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before scanning the network, as it helps the attacker gain additional credentials to move laterally within the network.

- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While it is a common technique, it is not necessarily a step that occurs between infecting internal hosts and scanning the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access**: Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools signed with stolen digital certificates to infect internal hosts.
2. **Post-Infection**: After gaining access, the attacker would likely want to gather more information and credentials to move laterally within the network.
3. **Credential Dumping**: T1003-OS Credential Dumping is a logical step to extract credentials from the infected hosts.
4. **Network Scanning**: Once the attacker has additional credentials, they can use them to scan the internal network for open ports and expand their foothold.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between infecting internal hosts and scanning the network is **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**.

**Final Answer: C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
