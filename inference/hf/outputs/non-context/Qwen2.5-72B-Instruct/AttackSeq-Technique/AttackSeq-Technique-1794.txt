### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where OceanLotus gains initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious macros. The focus is on the reconnaissance phase, specifically targeting top-level management for information gathering.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious macros.
  - Reconnaissance: Information gathering from top-level management.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information from victims, which aligns well with the reconnaissance phase and the goal of gathering information from top-level management.
  - **Relevance**: High. This technique fits the context of information gathering during the reconnaissance phase.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system, which is already mentioned in the question (spear-phishing emails with malicious macros).
  - **Relevance**: Low. While this technique is relevant to the initial access phase, the question specifically asks about the reconnaissance phase.

- **Answer Choice C: T1596.004-CDNs**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host malicious content or exfiltrate data.
  - **Relevance**: Low. This technique is not directly related to information gathering or reconnaissance.

- **Answer Choice D: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves using legitimate Windows utilities (Regsvcs/Regasm) to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: Low. This technique is more related to execution and persistence rather than reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with spear-phishing emails containing malicious macros, which aligns with T1566-Phishing.
2. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The question specifically asks about the reconnaissance phase, where the attackers target top-level management for information gathering.
3. **Relevant Technique**: T1598-Phishing for Information is the most relevant technique for the reconnaissance phase, as it involves using phishing to gather information from victims.

**Final Answer: A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
