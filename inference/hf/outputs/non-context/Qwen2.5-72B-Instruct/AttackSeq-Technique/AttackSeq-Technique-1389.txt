### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Bypassing blocking of active C&C servers through Telegram channels.
2. Executing malicious stealers to gather system and sensitive data.
3. Obscuring communication between systems to maintain access undetected.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence.

- **A: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C&C servers. While it can be used to bypass blocking, it doesn't specifically address the need to obscure communication or maintain access undetected.

- **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This technique involves using cloud services to establish a foothold and maintain access. While it can be used to bypass blocking, it doesn't specifically address the need to obscure communication.

- **C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
  - This technique involves using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate to systems. It is more related to lateral movement and maintaining access but doesn't specifically address the need to obscure communication.

- **D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves using legitimate protocols and services to mask malicious traffic. It is specifically designed to obscure communication and maintain access undetected, which aligns well with the described need to obscure communication between systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence involves bypassing blocking of C&C servers and executing stealers to gather data.
2. The next step is to obscure communication to maintain access undetected.
3. Among the given choices, T1205-Traffic Signaling is the most relevant technique for obscuring communication and maintaining access undetected.

**Final Answer: D: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
