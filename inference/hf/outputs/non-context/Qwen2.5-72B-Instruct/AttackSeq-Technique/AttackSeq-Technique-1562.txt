### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Context**: The question describes an attack sequence in Operation NightScout.
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a supply chain attack on BigNox's update mechanism.
- **Objective**: Before extracting C&C information to a file on the victim's system, the attackers need to evade detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1497.001-System Checks**
  - **Description**: This technique involves checking the system for security software or other indicators that might detect the attack.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be part of the evasion process, it is more about reconnaissance rather than active evasion.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or other indicators of the attack to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This is a direct method of evading detection by ensuring that the attack's presence is not easily discovered.

- **Answer Choice C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising a third-party supply chain to gain initial access to the target.
  - **Relevance**: This is the initial access method, not an evasion technique.

- **Answer Choice D: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using voice communication to trick victims into providing information or performing actions.
  - **Relevance**: This is a method of initial access or information gathering, not an evasion technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a supply chain compromise (T1195), which is already mentioned in the question.
2. **Evasion**: After gaining initial access, the attackers need to evade detection before performing further actions.
3. **Hiding Artifacts**: The most plausible technique for evading detection is hiding artifacts (T1564). This ensures that the presence of the attack is not easily detected by security software or system administrators.
4. **Other Techniques**: System checks (T1497.001) are more about reconnaissance, and spearphishing voice (T1598.004) is not relevant to the evasion phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
