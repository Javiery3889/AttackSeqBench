### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial compromise is achieved through exploiting known vulnerabilities in malicious documents.
   - The focus is on the technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 (Command and Control) server during communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Compromise: Exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents.
   - Objective: Conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate command and control traffic.
     - While it can be used to obfuscate data, it does not directly conceal the identity of the C2 server.

   - **B: T1197-BITS Jobs**
     - This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files and communicate with a C2 server.
     - BITS Jobs can be used to transfer files and communicate, but they do not inherently conceal the identity of the C2 server.

   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to deliver malicious documents or links.
     - Phishing is an initial access technique and does not directly relate to concealing the identity of the C2 server.

   - **D: T1090-Proxy**
     - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server, which can effectively conceal the identity of the C2 server.
     - Proxies are commonly used to obfuscate the true destination of C2 traffic, making it a strong candidate for concealing the C2 server's identity.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible technique for concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication is **T1090-Proxy**. Proxies are specifically designed to route traffic through an intermediary, which can effectively hide the true destination of the C2 server.

### Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy
