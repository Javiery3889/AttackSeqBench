### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with a spear-phishing email delivering a Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119).
   - After the exploit, the attacker collects system information on the victim's browser.
   - The next step is to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task with the highest privileges.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email (T1566)
   - **Execution:** Delivering the Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119)
   - **Discovery:** Collecting system information on the victim's browser
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creating a scheduled task with the highest privileges
   - **Persistence:** Establishing persistence

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1098.005-Device Registration**
     - This technique involves registering a device in a cloud service, which is not relevant to the sequence described. It does not fit the context of privilege escalation or persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher privileges. This fits well with the step of creating a scheduled task with the highest privileges.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1047-Windows Management Instrumentation**
     - This technique involves using WMI for various purposes, including execution and persistence. While it could be used for persistence, it is not specifically about privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is already mentioned in the question. It does not fit the step of privilege escalation or persistence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email (T1566).
2. **Execution:** The Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) is delivered.
3. **Discovery:** The attacker collects system information on the victim's browser.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** To create a scheduled task with the highest privileges, the attacker needs to escalate their privileges. This is best represented by T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation.
5. **Persistence:** The attacker establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
