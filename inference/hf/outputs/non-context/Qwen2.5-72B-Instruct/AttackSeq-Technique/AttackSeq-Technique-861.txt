### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where TG-3279:
     - Used Conpee or Etso tools on key hosts.
     - Added scheduled system tasks to key resources.
     - Used compromised credentials from pwdump6.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated C2 (Command and Control) communication using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
     - This technique involves using mail protocols (e.g., SMTP, IMAP) for C2 communication. However, the question specifically mentions port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS, not mail protocols.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports. While it is a common initial step in many attacks, it does not directly facilitate C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for C2 communication. The question mentions using port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which fits this description. Port 443 is standard for HTTPS, but using it for non-HTTPS traffic is a form of non-standard port usage.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves acquiring infrastructure (e.g., servers, domains) to support the attack. While it is a crucial step in setting up C2 infrastructure, it does not directly describe the communication method.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible answer is **C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**. This technique aligns with the use of port 443 for non-HTTPS traffic, which is a common tactic to evade detection by blending in with legitimate HTTPS traffic.

**Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
