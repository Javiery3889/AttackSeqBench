### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where:
- A specific domain and IP address combination is configured per target.
- Privacy services are used to hide the real identity.
- Malware communicates with C&C servers to protect communications from identification.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

**A: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
- Fast Flux DNS is a technique where attackers use a large pool of IP addresses to frequently change the DNS records of a domain. This makes it difficult to track the actual location of the C&C server.
- This technique is used to hide the real identity and make it harder to identify the C&C server, which aligns with the scenario described.

**B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
- Encrypted Channel involves using encryption to protect the communication between the malware and the C&C server from being intercepted and analyzed.
- While this technique is used to protect communications, it does not specifically address the use of domain and IP address combinations or privacy services to hide the real identity.

**C: T1542.001-System Firmware**
- System Firmware involves modifying the firmware of a system to maintain persistence or to execute malicious code.
- This technique is not related to communication with C&C servers or hiding the real identity.

**D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
- Indicator Removal involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection.
- This technique is used to clean up after an attack but does not address the initial communication with C&C servers or the use of domain and IP address combinations.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes the use of specific domain and IP address combinations and privacy services to hide the real identity of the attacker.
- Fast Flux DNS (T1568.001) is a technique that fits this description by frequently changing DNS records to make it difficult to track the C&C server.
- The other techniques (Encrypted Channel, System Firmware, and Indicator Removal) do not align as closely with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: A: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
