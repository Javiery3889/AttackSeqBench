### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before WinDealer began execution by locating and decoding an embedded DLL file within its resources. This implies that we need to identify a technique that would logically precede the loading and execution of a DLL.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services such as SSH, RDP, or VNC to gain access to a system. While this could be part of the initial access phase, it does not directly relate to the loading and execution of a DLL.

- **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves loading a shared library or module into the memory space of a process. This is a plausible candidate because it directly relates to the loading of a DLL. The DLL could be embedded within the resources of the malware and then loaded into memory.

- **C: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. This is not relevant to the loading and execution of a DLL on a Windows system.

- **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols below the application layer to communicate with a command and control server. While this could be used for communication, it does not directly relate to the loading and execution of a DLL.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access and Execution**: The malware (WinDealer) needs to gain initial access to the system and execute.
2. **Loading the DLL**: Before the DLL can be executed, it must be loaded into memory. This is where the technique of loading a shared module (T1129) comes into play.
3. **Decoding and Execution**: Once the DLL is loaded, it can be decoded and executed.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred before the DLL was located and decoded is **T1129-Shared Modules**.

### Final Answer: B: T1129-Shared Modules
