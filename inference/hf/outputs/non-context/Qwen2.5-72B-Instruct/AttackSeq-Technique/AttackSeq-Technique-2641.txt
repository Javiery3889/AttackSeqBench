### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already enumerated running processes to search for browsers and generated file listings for exfiltration. The next step in the sequence is to collect specific visual content on the compromised system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - **Description**: Capturing the screen of a system to gather visual information.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the need to collect specific visual content on the compromised system. After enumerating processes and generating file listings, capturing the screen would be a logical next step to gather visual data.

- **B: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - **Description**: Compressing and archiving collected data to prepare it for exfiltration.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about preparing data for exfiltration rather than collecting visual content. It would typically follow the collection of data, not precede it.

- **C: T1574.014-AppDomainManager**
  - **Description**: Using the AppDomainManager to load and execute arbitrary code in the context of a .NET application.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about code execution and persistence, not about collecting visual content. It does not fit the described sequence.

- **D: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
  - **Description**: Discovering and enumerating peripheral devices connected to the system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about identifying connected devices, which is not directly related to collecting visual content. It would be more relevant in a different context, such as identifying potential data sources.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has already enumerated running processes to search for browsers and generated file listings for exfiltration.
2. The next logical step in the sequence is to collect specific visual content on the compromised system.
3. Among the given choices, T1113-Screen Capture is the only technique that directly involves collecting visual content.
4. The other techniques (T1560, T1574.014, and T1120) do not align with the need to collect visual content.

**Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture**
