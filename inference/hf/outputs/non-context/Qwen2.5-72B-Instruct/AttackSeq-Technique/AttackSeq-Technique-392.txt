### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where Vyveva's backdoor collects files from the system and newly inserted removable media, and then sends the collected data to the C&C server in an encrypted manner. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration of the collected data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
  - This technique involves preventing or removing indicators of compromise, such as logs or security alerts. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the collection and exfiltration of data.

- **B: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves using automated methods to collect data from the system. This aligns well with the description of the backdoor collecting files from the system and newly inserted removable media.

- **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves sending data to a C2 server. This is the final step in the sequence, not the step before exfiltration.

- **D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves compressing or archiving the collected data before exfiltration. This is a plausible step that could occur before the data is sent to the C2 server, especially if the data is being encrypted and sent in a compressed form.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Automated Collection (T1119)**: The backdoor collects files from the system and newly inserted removable media.
2. **Archive Collected Data (T1560)**: The collected data is compressed or archived to make it easier to exfiltrate.
3. **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: The archived and encrypted data is sent to the C2 server.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred before exfiltrating the collected data in an encrypted manner is **T1560-Archive Collected Data**.

**Final Answer: D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
