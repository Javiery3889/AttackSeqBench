### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the wiper module used RawDisk to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system. The focus is on the sequence of TTPs leading up to the impact phase, specifically the use of a wiper module.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - Data Encoding is a technique used to encode data to make it less recognizable to defenders. This is typically used in the exfiltration or command and control phases, not directly before a wiper module is used to overwrite data.

- **B: T1561-Disk Wipe**
  - Disk Wipe is a technique that involves erasing data from storage devices, which aligns directly with the use of a wiper module to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files. This is the most relevant technique in the context of the question.

- **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique used to manipulate the ARP cache to redirect traffic. This is more relevant to network manipulation and does not directly relate to the wiper module's function.

- **D: T1499.002-Service Exhaustion Flood**
  - Service Exhaustion Flood is a technique used to overwhelm services, causing denial of service. This is more relevant to the disruption phase and does not directly relate to the wiper module's function.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Encoding (T1132)**: This technique is not directly related to the wiper module's function of overwriting data.
2. **Disk Wipe (T1561)**: This technique directly involves erasing data from storage devices, which is exactly what the wiper module does.
3. **ARP Cache Poisoning (T1557.002)**: This technique is more about network manipulation and does not relate to the wiper module.
4. **Service Exhaustion Flood (T1499.002)**: This technique is about overwhelming services and does not relate to the wiper module.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the wiper module used the Disk Wipe technique to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system.

**Final Answer: B: T1561-Disk Wipe**
