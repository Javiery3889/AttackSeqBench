### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) Poison Ivy variant. The sequence includes:
1. **DLL Sideloading** (T1574.002) to evade defenses.
2. **Preparation for malicious actions**.
3. **Communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers using modified configurations**.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves altering the way programs load or execute to run malicious code. While DLL sideloading is a form of hijacking execution flow, the question specifically mentions that the RAT has already used DLL sideloading to evade defenses. The next step in the sequence is communication with C2 servers, not further hijacking execution flow.

- **B: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - Steganography involves hiding data within other data to avoid detection. While this technique can be used to evade detection, it is not typically used for communication with C2 servers. It is more about concealing data rather than establishing a communication channel.

- **C: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**
  - This technique involves intercepting and using multi-factor authentication (MFA) credentials. It is not relevant to the communication with C2 servers, which is the focus of the question.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers. It is a common method for establishing and maintaining communication with C2 servers, especially when using modified configurations to evade detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **DLL Sideloading (T1574.002)**: The RAT uses this technique to evade defenses.
2. **Preparation for malicious actions**: The RAT prepares to perform its intended malicious activities.
3. **Communication with C2 servers using modified configurations**: The RAT needs to establish a communication channel with its C2 servers, which is best achieved using standard application layer protocols (T1071).

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible next step after evading defenses and preparing for malicious actions is to establish communication with the C2 servers using application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
