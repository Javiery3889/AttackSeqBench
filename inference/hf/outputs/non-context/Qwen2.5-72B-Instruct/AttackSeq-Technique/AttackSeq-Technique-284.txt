### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: Dropping Elephant used spear-phishing emails with exploit documents.
- **Final Step**: Employed encoded blobs to bypass detection for downloading additional malware.
- **Question**: What ATT&CK technique most likely occurred in between these two steps?

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1059.011-Lua**: This technique involves using Lua scripting for command and scripting interpretation. While it could be used in an attack, it is not typically a common step between initial access and bypassing detection.
- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This is a broader category that includes various scripting and command-line techniques. It is a common step in many attack sequences, often used to execute additional commands or scripts after gaining initial access.
- **C: T1087.001-Local Account**: This technique involves identifying local accounts on a system. While it can be useful for further reconnaissance, it is not typically a direct step in the sequence of bypassing detection and downloading additional malware.
- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**: This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While it can be useful for lateral movement, it is not typically a direct step in the sequence of bypassing detection and downloading additional malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access using spear-phishing emails with exploit documents.
2. **Next Step**: After gaining access, the attacker needs to execute commands or scripts to further their attack. This is where T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter comes into play.
3. **Final Step**: The attacker uses encoded blobs to bypass detection and download additional malware.

**Reasoning**:
- T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter is a logical next step after gaining initial access. It allows the attacker to execute commands and scripts necessary to maintain control and prepare for the next phase of the attack.
- The other techniques (T1059.011-Lua, T1087.001-Local Account, T1555-Credentials from Password Stores) are less likely to be the immediate next step in this sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
