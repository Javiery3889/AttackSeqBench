### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a victim is enticed to interact with a malicious link leading to trojanized files.
   - The trojanized files are presented under the guise of 'Know Your Customer' banking procedures.
   - After the initial interaction, a script named 'DeleteLeftovers' is used to remove attack artifacts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Interaction:** The victim is enticed to click on a malicious link.
   - **Trojanized Files:** The link leads to the download or execution of trojanized files.
   - **Script Execution:** A script named 'DeleteLeftovers' is used to remove attack artifacts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves the use of legitimate command shells or scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts.
     - It aligns with the use of the 'DeleteLeftovers' script to remove attack artifacts.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1585-Establish Accounts**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying accounts to maintain access.
     - It does not align with the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves sending data to an attacker-controlled system over a command and control (C2) channel.
     - It does not align with the removal of attack artifacts.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
     - This sub-technique is a specific type of command and scripting interpreter that uses the Windows command shell.
     - It aligns with the use of the 'DeleteLeftovers' script to remove attack artifacts, but it is more specific than T1059.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of a command and scripting interpreter to execute the 'DeleteLeftovers' script.
   - While T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell) is a specific sub-technique, T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) is a broader category that encompasses the use of any scripting interpreter, including the Windows command shell.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
