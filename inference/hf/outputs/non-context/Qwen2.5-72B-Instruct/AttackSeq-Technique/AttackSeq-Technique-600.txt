### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker:
1. Uses proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement.
2. Establishes legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
3. Compiles binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point.
4. Establishes contact with the C2 servers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys to make brute-force attacks more feasible. It does not align with the described sequence of compiling binary files and establishing C2 communication.

- **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication to avoid detection. While it could be used in C2 communication, it does not directly relate to compiling binary files from decoded snippets.

- **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, which can be used to transmit data between the attacker and the victim. It aligns well with the described sequence, as the attacker might encode the binary file snippets and then decode them to compile the binary files. This technique is also relevant to establishing C2 communication, as encoded data can be transmitted to and from the C2 server.

- **D: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
  - This technique involves modifying the authentication process to gain unauthorized access. It does not align with the described sequence of compiling binary files and establishing C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Proxy Tools and Lateral Movement**: The use of proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement is a common technique to move within a network.
2. **Establishing C2 Servers**: Using legitimate external websites as C2 servers is a method to avoid detection by blending in with normal traffic.
3. **Compiling Binary Files**: The attacker compiles binary files from decoded snippets, which suggests that the data was encoded and then decoded.
4. **Establishing C2 Communication**: The encoded data is likely used to establish and maintain communication with the C2 server.

Given the sequence of TTPs, the most plausible technique that aligns with compiling binary files from decoded snippets and establishing C2 communication is **T1132-Data Encoding**.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
