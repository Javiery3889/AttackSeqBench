### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses defense evasion methods such as redirecting victims to legitimate services and using domain shortening services. The goal is to access credentials through phishing pages that impersonate login portals.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1003.004-LSA Secrets**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets. While this is a method to obtain credentials, it is typically used post-compromise and not in the context of initial access through phishing.

- **B: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. While it can be used for various purposes, including obfuscation and evasion, it is not directly related to the initial access through phishing.

- **C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or acquiring custom capabilities, such as malware or tools. It is not directly related to the initial access through phishing.

- **D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to obtain credentials. This is directly related to the use of phishing pages to impersonate login portals and capture user credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker uses defense evasion methods to redirect victims to phishing pages.
2. The goal of these phishing pages is to capture user credentials.
3. Among the given choices, T1056-Input Capture is the most relevant technique because it directly involves capturing user input, such as credentials, through phishing pages.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
