### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker:
1. Establishing an HTTP POST request to connect with `updaterweb[.]com`.
2. Attempting to retrieve files from directories such as `C:\Program Files` using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`.
3. Encoding collected system information for transmission.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the encoding of collected system information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. While it is a common technique in the reconnaissance phase, it does not directly relate to the file retrieval and encoding steps described in the question.

- **B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying the system's owner or user. It is useful for understanding the environment but does not directly relate to the file retrieval and encoding steps.

- **C: T1484.001-Group Policy Modification**
  - This technique involves modifying Group Policy settings. It is typically used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges, but it does not directly relate to the file retrieval and encoding steps.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a remote system. The question mentions an HTTP POST request to establish a connection, which aligns with this technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence starts with an HTTP POST request to `updaterweb[.]com`, which is a clear indication of using an application layer protocol (T1071).
2. After establishing the connection, the attacker attempts to retrieve files from directories using `FindFirstFileW` and `FindNextFileW`, which is part of the file and directory discovery process.
3. Finally, the attacker encodes the collected system information for transmission.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before encoding the collected system information is the use of an application layer protocol to establish the initial connection.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
