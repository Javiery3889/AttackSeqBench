### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker:
1. Scanning for files with specific extensions.
2. Creating a file containing paths of all files to retrieve.
3. Hex-encoding and encrypting the data.
4. Transmitting the data to a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - **Description**: Fallback channels are used when the primary communication channel is not available. This fits the context of transmitting data to a fallback C&C server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is directly related to the final step of transmitting data to a fallback C&C server.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - **Description**: Screen capture involves capturing images of the screen to gather information.
  - **Relevance**: This technique does not align with the described sequence of actions, which focuses on file exfiltration and data transmission.

- **C: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying or bypassing multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the described sequence of actions, which does not mention any authentication mechanisms.

- **D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - **Description**: Protocol tunneling involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security measures.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be relevant to the transmission of data, but it is not specifically mentioned in the context of a fallback C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence of actions involves scanning for files, creating a file of paths, hex-encoding and encrypting the data, and transmitting it to a fallback C&C server.
2. The most relevant technique to the final step of transmitting data to a fallback C&C server is T1008-Fallback Channels.
3. The other techniques (T1113-Screen Capture, T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication, and T1572-Protocol Tunneling) do not align as closely with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
