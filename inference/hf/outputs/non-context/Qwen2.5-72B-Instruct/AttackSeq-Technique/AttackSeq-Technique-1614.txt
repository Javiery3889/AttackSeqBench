### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Lazarus group used lateral movement through SMB shares with hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
- **Objective**: Determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response to the heist.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves preventing the system from being restored or rebooted, which can disrupt operations and delay response.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the goal of disrupting operations and delaying the response to the heist.

- **Answer Choice B: T1553.005 - Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
  - **Description**: This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms that rely on the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) to execute files downloaded from the internet.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about evading detection and does not directly disrupt operations or delay response.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with remote systems.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about communication and does not directly disrupt operations or delay response.

- **Answer Choice D: T1496.001 - Compute Hijacking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hijacking compute resources to perform tasks, such as mining cryptocurrency.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about resource exploitation and does not directly disrupt operations or delay response.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Lateral Movement**: The Lazarus group used SMB shares with hardcoded FEIB user accounts to move laterally within the network.
2. **Disruption and Delay**: The goal is to disrupt the bank's operations and delay the response to the heist.
3. **Evaluating Techniques**:
   - **T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery**: This technique directly disrupts operations by preventing system recovery, which can significantly delay the response to the heist.
   - **T1553.005 - Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**: This technique is more about evading detection and does not directly disrupt operations.
   - **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**: This technique is about communication and does not directly disrupt operations.
   - **T1496.001 - Compute Hijacking**: This technique is about resource exploitation and does not directly disrupt operations.

### Final Answer: A: T1490 - Inhibit System Recovery
