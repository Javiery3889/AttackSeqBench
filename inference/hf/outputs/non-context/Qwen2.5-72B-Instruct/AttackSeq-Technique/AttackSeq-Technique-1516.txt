### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the malware Trojan.APT.Seinup:
1. **Google Docs** is used to evade callback detection through redirection.
2. **Encrypted communications via SSL** are used during malicious communications.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
  - This technique involves the use of one-way communication channels, such as dead drop resolvers or one-way messaging systems. While it can be used for evasion, it doesn't directly align with the use of Google Docs and SSL for encrypted communications.

- **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, making it harder to detect. While encoding can be used in conjunction with encrypted communications, it is not the most direct next step after using Google Docs and SSL.

- **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
  - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for command and control (C2) communications. While it can be used for C2, it doesn't directly follow the use of Google Docs and SSL for encrypted communications.

- **D: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves disguising malicious files, processes, or other system entities to make them appear benign. This can be a logical next step after establishing encrypted communications and evading detection, as the attacker might want to further hide their activities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Google Docs for Evasion**: The use of Google Docs to evade callback detection through redirection is a form of C2 evasion.
2. **Encrypted Communications via SSL**: Using SSL for encrypted communications ensures that the data is not easily intercepted.
3. **Next Logical Step**: After establishing a secure and evasive communication channel, the attacker might want to further hide their activities by masquerading malicious files or processes to avoid detection by security tools and users.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is **T1036-Masquerading**.

**Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading**
