### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The attack started with phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
- **Execution**: The malicious Word documents led to the execution of an encoded PowerShell script, which then downloaded and executed payloads.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
  - This technique involves encrypting data to prevent access, typically seen in ransomware attacks. It does not fit the sequence of initial access and execution of payloads.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution**
  - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which aligns with the initial access through phishing emails. However, it does not specifically address the execution of the PowerShell script and the subsequent payload download.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - This sub-technique involves the use of malicious files, such as the Word documents in the phishing emails, to gain initial access. It fits the initial access part of the sequence but does not cover the execution of the PowerShell script and payload download.

- **Answer Choice D: T1555.006-Cloud Secrets Management Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from cloud-based secret management stores. It does not fit the sequence of initial access and execution of payloads through a PowerShell script.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The attack starts with phishing emails containing malicious Word documents, which aligns with T1204.002-Malicious File.
- **Execution**: The malicious Word documents lead to the execution of an encoded PowerShell script, which then downloads and executes payloads. This part of the sequence is not directly covered by T1204.002 but is a common follow-up action after initial access.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible answer is the one that covers the initial access through the malicious Word documents, which is T1204.002-Malicious File.

**Final Answer: C: T1204.002-Malicious File**
