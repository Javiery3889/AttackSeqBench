### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. A vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited to install malware.
2. The malware (Taidoor) begins beaconing to a C2 server using an HTTP GET request pattern.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the beaconing to the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This is what happens after the malware is installed and begins beaconing. Therefore, this technique is not the one that occurs before the beaconing.

- **B: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
  - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to introduce malicious code. This is not typically related to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office. It is more relevant to supply chain attacks.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to deliver a payload, such as a malicious document that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office. Phishing is a common initial access vector that can lead to the exploitation of a vulnerability and the installation of malware.

- **D: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**
  - This technique involves accessing cloud instance metadata to gather information about the cloud environment. This is not relevant to the initial exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office or the subsequent beaconing to a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step in the attack sequence is the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to install the malware.
2. Phishing (T1566) is a common method used to deliver a malicious document that exploits such a vulnerability.
3. After the malware is installed, it begins beaconing to the C2 server using an HTTP GET request pattern, which is an application layer protocol (T1071).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that phishing (T1566) occurred before the beaconing to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
