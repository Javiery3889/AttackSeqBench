### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Tildeb, a malware, uses command-line arguments to establish a TCP socket connection and then secures communication with its C2 server using encrypted traffic and a pseudorandom key exchange.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Command-line arguments** for communication.
  - **TCP socket connection** establishment.
  - **Encrypted traffic** for securing communication.
  - **Pseudorandom key exchange** for encryption.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications from being intercepted and analyzed.
  - **Relevance**: This choice is highly relevant because it directly addresses the use of encrypted traffic and key exchange to secure communication with the C2 server.

- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is related to communication, it does not specifically address the use of encryption and key exchange.

- **Answer Choice C: T1199-Trusted Relationship**
  - **Description**: This technique involves leveraging existing trust relationships (e.g., between systems or users) to gain access to a network or system.
  - **Relevance**: This choice is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not involve encryption or key exchange.

- **Answer Choice D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of shared libraries or modules to perform malicious activities.
  - **Relevance**: This choice is not relevant to the described sequence of TTPs, as it does not involve encryption or key exchange.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions the use of encrypted traffic and a pseudorandom key exchange to secure communication with the C2 server.
  - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most appropriate choice because it directly addresses the use of encryption to protect C2 communications.
  - The other choices (T1071, T1199, and T1129) do not specifically address the encryption and key exchange aspects of the described TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
