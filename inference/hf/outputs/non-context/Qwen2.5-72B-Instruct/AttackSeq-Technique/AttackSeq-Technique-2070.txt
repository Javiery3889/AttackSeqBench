### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: Whitefly gained initial access via spear-phishing emails containing a disguised dropper.
- **Loader Trojan.Vcrodat**: This Trojan executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1608.004-Drive-by Target**
  - This technique involves an adversary delivering a payload to a victim through a web page or application. This does not align with the scenario where the initial access was via spear-phishing emails.

- **Answer Choice B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves an adversary identifying remote systems and their network configurations. This is typically a post-compromise activity and does not align with the execution of a loader Trojan to gain elevated privileges.

- **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves an adversary using shared libraries or modules to load and execute malicious code. This aligns well with the scenario where the loader Trojan.Vcrodat executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.

- **Answer Choice D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves an adversary using legitimate software deployment tools to distribute and execute malicious code. While this could be relevant in some scenarios, it does not specifically align with the execution of a loader Trojan to gain elevated privileges.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Whitefly used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
2. **Loader Trojan.Vcrodat**: This Trojan executed malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The execution of malicious DLLs to gain elevated privileges aligns with the use of shared modules (T1129).

**Final Answer: C: T1129-Shared Modules**
