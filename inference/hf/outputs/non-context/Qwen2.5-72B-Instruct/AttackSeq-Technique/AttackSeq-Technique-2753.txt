### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an initial attack sequence where attackers send spear phishing emails containing compressed executables or phishing links to senior executives. The goal of this initial phase is to gather initial information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1592.003-Firmware**
  - This technique involves collecting information from firmware. It is not typically a next step after a spear phishing campaign, as it is more specialized and usually occurs later in an attack lifecycle when the attacker has more control over the system.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2) server. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after a spear phishing campaign.

- **C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gather information. Given that the initial attack involved spear phishing to gather initial information, this technique is a logical next step. The attackers might continue to use phishing to gather more detailed information once they have initial access.

- **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forking to hide data. It is not a typical next step after a spear phishing campaign and is more related to data exfiltration or persistence techniques.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial attack involves spear phishing emails to gather initial information.
2. The next logical step would be to continue gathering more detailed information, which aligns with the technique **T1598-Phishing for Information**.
3. The other techniques (T1592.003-Firmware, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, and T1564.009-Resource Forking) are either too specialized or not immediate next steps in the context of the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
