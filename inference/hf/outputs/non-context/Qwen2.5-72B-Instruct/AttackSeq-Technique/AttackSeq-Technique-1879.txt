### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor group FIN13:
1. Conducted reconnaissance by mapping victim networks.
2. Captured credentials.
3. Executed commands locally using JSPRAT.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of commands locally using JSPRAT.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. While this could be a part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not directly align with the sequence of actions described, which already includes reconnaissance and credential capture.

- **B: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
  - This technique involves modifying a network provider DLL to capture credentials. While it is related to credential capture, it is a more specific and advanced technique that is not typically used in the initial stages of an attack. It is more likely to be used after gaining some level of access.

- **C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to systems. Given that FIN13 has already captured credentials, it is plausible that they would use these credentials to log into local accounts and execute commands locally.

- **D: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the victim's network, which is part of the reconnaissance phase. However, the question already states that reconnaissance has been conducted, so this technique would not be the next step before executing commands locally.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance and Credential Capture**: FIN13 has already mapped the victim network and captured credentials.
2. **Execution of Commands Locally**: The next logical step would be to use the captured credentials to log into local accounts and execute commands.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A** and **D** are not relevant as they are either initial access techniques or part of the reconnaissance phase, which has already been completed.
   - **B** is a more advanced technique for credential capture and is not the most likely next step.
   - **C** aligns with the sequence as it involves using the captured credentials to log into local accounts.

**Final Answer: C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
