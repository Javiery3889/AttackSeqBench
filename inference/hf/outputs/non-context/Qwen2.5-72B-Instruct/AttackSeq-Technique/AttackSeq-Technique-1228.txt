### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Inception attackers.
   - The sequence starts with **Reconnaissance** and **spear phishing with a remote template** to deliver a payload.
   - The payload leverages a year-old Office vulnerability, **CVE-2017-11882**, to gain access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. However, the question mentions a vulnerability in Office, which is not typically a public-facing application. This choice is less likely to be correct.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1598 - Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves phishing to gather information, but the question already mentions that the initial step was spear phishing with a remote template to deliver a payload. This choice does not align with the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1134.002 - Create Process with Token**
     - This technique involves creating a process with a token, which is more related to privilege escalation or maintaining access, not the initial exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1133 - External Remote Services**
     - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access, but the question specifically mentions leveraging a vulnerability in Office (CVE-2017-11882) to gain access, not using external remote services.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance** to gather information.
     2. **Spear Phishing with a Remote Template** to deliver a payload.
     3. **Exploiting the Office Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882)** to gain access.
   - The technique that best fits the exploitation of a specific vulnerability in Office is **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**, even though Office is not typically a public-facing application. However, in the context of the question, it is the closest match for the exploitation step.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
