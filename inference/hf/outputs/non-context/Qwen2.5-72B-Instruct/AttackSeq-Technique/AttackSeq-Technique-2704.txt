### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where:
1. The file-time of a dropped DLL is modified to evade detection.
2. A secondary payload is installed by targeting Internet Explorer 6 with a JavaScript-based exploit.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to spread malware. It does not fit the context of modifying file times or exploiting a web application.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, such as a web browser. Given that the question mentions targeting Internet Explorer 6 with a JavaScript-based exploit, this technique is highly relevant.

- **C: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It does not fit the context of modifying file times or exploiting a web application.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to evade detection. While it is related to the modification of file times, it does not fit the context of the initial exploitation of the web application.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where a DLL's file-time is modified to evade detection.
2. The next step involves installing a secondary payload by exploiting Internet Explorer 6 with a JavaScript-based exploit.
3. Among the answer choices, **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is the most relevant because it directly involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which in this case is Internet Explorer 6.

**Final Answer: B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
