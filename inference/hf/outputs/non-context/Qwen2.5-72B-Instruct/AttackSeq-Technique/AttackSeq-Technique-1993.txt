### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy encoded data and exfiltrated it to its C2 server via a structured HTTP POST request.
   - The key actions mentioned are:
     - Encoding data
     - Exfiltrating data via a structured HTTP POST request

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1036.009-Break Process Trees**
     - This technique involves manipulating process relationships to hide the presence of malicious processes. It is not directly related to data encoding or exfiltration.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to data encoding or exfiltration.
   - **C: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it appear benign or to avoid detection. This is directly related to the encoding of data before exfiltration.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection**
     - This technique involves using automated methods to collect data from the victim's system. While this could be a step before encoding and exfiltration, it is not as directly related to the specific action of encoding data.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that data would be collected (potentially through automated means), then encoded to avoid detection, and finally exfiltrated via a structured HTTP POST request.
   - Among the given choices, **T1132-Data Encoding** is the most directly relevant to the step that occurs before the exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding
