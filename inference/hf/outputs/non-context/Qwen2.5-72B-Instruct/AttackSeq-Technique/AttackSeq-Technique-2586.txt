### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where malware gains initial access to systems via an altered Polish Financial Supervision Authority website.
- The malware then manipulates service names and installs DLLs, but the focus is on the initial access method.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. This could be a web application, such as the altered Polish Financial Supervision Authority website.
- **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**: This technique involves discovering network connections and is typically used for reconnaissance after gaining access, not for initial access.
- **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**: This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to gain access, which is not typically used for initial access via a public-facing website.
- **T1078.002-Domain Accounts**: This technique involves using valid domain accounts to gain access, which is more about leveraging existing credentials rather than exploiting a public-facing application.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes gaining initial access via an altered website, which suggests an exploit of a public-facing application.
- T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application is the most plausible technique for this initial access method.
- The other techniques (T1049, T1207, T1078.002) are either used for different stages of the attack or do not fit the context of gaining initial access via a public-facing website.

**Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
