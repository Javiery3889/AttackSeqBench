### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question is about the sequence of TTPs used by the UNC2452 group after gaining initial access via a compromised software supply chain (SolarWinds Orion).
- **Initial Access**: The initial access was achieved through a compromised software supply chain, which means the attackers embedded malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software updates.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1569 - System Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries configuring or modifying system services to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be a technique used later in the attack, it is not the most immediate step after gaining initial access through a software supply chain.

- **Answer Choice B: T1583 - Acquire Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries acquiring infrastructure to support operations.
  - **Relevance**: This is typically a pre-attack activity and not a step that follows initial access.

- **Answer Choice C: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because the attackers used the SolarWinds Orion software deployment tools to distribute the malicious code. After gaining initial access, they would use these tools to execute their payload.

- **Answer Choice D: T1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries manipulating the search order for DLLs to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This is a technique that could be used to maintain persistence or execute code, but it is not the most immediate step after gaining initial access through a software supply chain.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access was achieved through a compromised software supply chain, meaning the attackers embedded malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion updates.
  - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to use the software deployment tools to execute the malicious code.
  - **T1072 - Software Deployment Tools** is the most plausible technique that follows the initial access via a compromised software supply chain.

**Final Answer: C: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**
