### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker, specifically the Gamaredon group, scans all drives (including network shares and removable drives) for sensitive documents and then exfiltrates the collected data to a C&C server. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not directly related to scanning drives for sensitive documents. It is more about capturing visual information rather than file content.

- **B: T1114.001-Local Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting emails from local email clients. While it is related to collecting sensitive information, it is specific to emails and not to scanning all drives for documents.

- **C: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. It is a broad technique that can be used for various purposes, including file operations. However, it is not specific to the act of scanning drives for sensitive documents.

- **D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the search order for executable files to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to scanning drives for sensitive documents.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifies that the attacker is scanning all drives for sensitive documents. This implies a file search or collection activity.
  - Among the given choices, **T1106-Native API** is the most plausible because it can be used to interact with the file system and perform the necessary file operations to scan and collect sensitive documents.
  - The other techniques (T1113, T1114.001, and T1574.008) are not directly related to the file scanning and collection process described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1106-Native API**
