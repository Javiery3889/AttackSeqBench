### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions where the InfoOS module gathers system information and the RemoteShell module lists installed applications and iPhone backups.
- **Objective**: Determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in the sequence after these discovery actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **InfoOS Module**: This module is likely used to gather detailed information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, and system configuration.
- **RemoteShell Module**: This module is used to execute commands remotely, which can be used to list installed applications and iPhone backups.

Given these actions, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to further explore the system or network to gather more detailed information or to prepare for further exploitation.

#### Evaluate Each Answer Choice:
- **A: T1090-Proxy**: This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not a direct next step after gathering system information and listing applications.
- **B: T1057-Process Discovery**: This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. Given that the RemoteShell module has already listed installed applications, the next logical step could be to discover running processes to understand the current state of the system.
- **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input from the graphical user interface. This is more related to credential harvesting and is not a direct next step after the described discovery actions.
- **D: T1040-Network Sniffing**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it is a valid next step, it is more focused on network-level information rather than system-level information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **InfoOS Module**: Gathered system information.
2. **RemoteShell Module**: Listed installed applications and iPhone backups.
3. **Next Logical Step**: After gathering system and application information, the attacker would likely want to understand the current state of the system, including running processes.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
