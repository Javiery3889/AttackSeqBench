### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where spear-phishing emails are used for initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers (Moafee and DragonOK) deploy custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs (Remote Access Trojans).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails (T1566)
   - **Deployment of Tools:** Custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1587.002 - Code Signing Certificates**
     - This technique involves using code signing certificates to sign malicious software, making it appear more trustworthy. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the primary focus of the described activity.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1588 - Obtain Capabilities**
     - This technique involves acquiring tools, such as custom-built backdoors and RATs, which aligns with the described activity of deploying these tools after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1491.001 - Internal Defacement**
     - This technique involves altering internal web pages or other information systems to display attacker-controlled content. This does not align with the described activity of deploying backdoors and RATs.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1566 - Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is the first step in the described attack sequence. However, the question specifically asks about the activity after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing emails (T1566).
   - After gaining access, the attackers deploy custom-built backdoors and publicly available RATs.
   - The technique that best describes the deployment of these tools is T1588 - Obtain Capabilities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
