### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used DLL side-loading to execute the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The next step in the attack sequence is to maintain the malware's presence on the system. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used for this purpose.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**
  - This technique involves modifying the Outlook Home Page to execute a malicious payload. While this can be used for persistence, it is less common and more specific to email clients. It is not the most likely choice for maintaining the presence of a RAT like PlugX.

- **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
  - This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials. While useful for credential theft, it is not directly related to maintaining the presence of the malware on the system.

- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common and effective method for maintaining persistence, making it a strong candidate.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the system. While useful for initial compromise, it is not relevant to maintaining the presence of the malware after it has already been executed.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Compromise**: The attacker uses DLL side-loading to execute the PlugX RAT.
2. **Persistence**: To maintain the presence of the RAT on the system, the attacker needs to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on.
3. **Evaluation of Techniques**:
   - **A: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page** - Not a common method for persistence.
   - **B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking** - Useful for credential theft, not persistence.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** - Common and effective for maintaining persistence.
   - **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** - Relevant for initial access, not persistence.

### Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
