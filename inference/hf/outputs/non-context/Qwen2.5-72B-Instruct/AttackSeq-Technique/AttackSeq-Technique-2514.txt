### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where GreyEnergy used tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement within a compromised network. The next step in the sequence is obtaining domain administrator privileges by collecting passwords. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this password collection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access a system. While it can be used for initial access, it is not typically used for lateral movement within a network after initial compromise.

- **B: T1027.007-Dynamic API Resolution**
  - This technique involves dynamically resolving API functions to evade detection. It is more related to malware obfuscation and not directly to lateral movement or credential collection.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using various remote services (e.g., RDP, SMB) to move laterally within a network. PsExec and WinExe are tools that use SMB (Server Message Block) to execute commands on remote systems, which aligns with this technique.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a network. While it can be used to obtain initial credentials, it is not typically used for lateral movement within a network after initial compromise.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Compromise**: The attacker has already gained access to the network.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker uses tools like PsExec and WinExe to move laterally within the network. These tools are part of the T1021-Remote Services technique.
3. **Credential Collection**: After gaining access to multiple systems, the attacker collects domain administrator passwords to escalate privileges.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the password collection is T1021-Remote Services.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
