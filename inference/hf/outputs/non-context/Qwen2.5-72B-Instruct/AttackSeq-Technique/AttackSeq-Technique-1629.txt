### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT28.
- The sequence starts with bots scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
- After identifying vulnerable systems, APT28 gains initial access via spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1564.003-Hidden Window**
  - This technique involves hiding windows to avoid detection. It is typically used during the execution or persistence phase, not during the initial reconnaissance or scanning phase.
- **Answer Choice B: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for information to identify potential targets. It aligns with the description of bots scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
- **Answer Choice C: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not relevant to the initial scanning phase.
- **Answer Choice D: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This is the same as Answer Choice B and also aligns with the description of bots scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question starts with scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems.
- The technique that best fits this initial phase is **T1595-Active Scanning**.
- Both Answer Choices B and D are the same and correct, but we will select one of them.

**Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning**
