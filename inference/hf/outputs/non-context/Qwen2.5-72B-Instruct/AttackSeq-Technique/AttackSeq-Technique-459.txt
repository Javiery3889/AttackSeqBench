### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware CEIDPageLock:
1. It uses a dropped driver to evade detection by endpoint security products.
2. The driver then connects to one of two hard-coded C&C (Command and Control) domains.
3. The driver downloads the homepage configuration from the C&C domain.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs:

- **A: T1216.002-SyncAppvPublishingServer**
  - This technique involves using a specific Windows feature to execute arbitrary code. It does not align with the described sequence of evading detection and connecting to a C&C server.

- **B: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature**
  - This technique involves using an invalid or no code signature to evade detection. While this could be part of the initial evasion, it does not describe the action of connecting to a C&C server and downloading configuration.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. This aligns well with the described action of the driver connecting to a C&C domain and downloading the homepage configuration.

- **D: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories, which is not relevant to the described sequence of evading detection and connecting to a C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Evasion**: The malware uses a dropped driver to evade detection by endpoint security products. This is a common technique to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
2. **C&C Communication**: The driver then connects to a C&C server using a standard application layer protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to download the homepage configuration. This is a typical behavior for malware to receive further instructions or data.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible technique that describes the communication with the C&C server is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
