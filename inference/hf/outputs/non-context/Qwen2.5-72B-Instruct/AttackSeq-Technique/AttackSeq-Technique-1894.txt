### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after FIN13 utilized lateral movement methods such as WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE to access additional systems within the network?
- **Key Points**:
  - FIN13 used lateral movement methods (WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE).
  - The question asks what technique likely followed this lateral movement.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after lateral movement.
  - **B: T1123-Audio Capture**: This technique involves capturing audio from a system. This is a very specific and less common technique and is not typically a direct follow-up to lateral movement.
  - **C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services. After gaining access to additional systems, exfiltrating data is a common and logical next step.
  - **D: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While this is a plausible next step, it is more about data collection rather than exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells to move laterally within the network, gaining access to additional systems.
  - **Next Logical Step**: After gaining access to these systems, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate any valuable data that has been collected or identified.
  - **Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)**: This technique is a common method for exfiltrating data, especially after lateral movement, as it can be stealthy and use existing web services to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
