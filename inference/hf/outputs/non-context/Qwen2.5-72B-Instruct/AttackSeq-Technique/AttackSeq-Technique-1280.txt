### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tropic Trooper malware:
1. The installer executed an MSI package to drop and configure files.
2. A malicious loader used DLL hijacking to inject a DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces to execute commands and scripts. While it is a common technique for initial access and execution, it is not directly related to the steps of dropping and configuring files or DLL hijacking.

- **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It is typically used for reconnaissance and data exfiltration, not for file manipulation or DLL injection.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, registry keys, or other artifacts to avoid detection. This could be relevant if the malware needs to hide the files it drops or the configuration changes it makes before proceeding to the next step.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute code. This is closely related to DLL hijacking, as it involves manipulating the loading of DLLs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Step**: The installer executes an MSI package to drop and configure files.
2. **Intermediate Step**: The malware needs to ensure that the files and configurations are in place and possibly hidden to avoid detection.
3. **Final Step**: The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking to inject a DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.

Given the sequence, the most plausible intermediate step is to hide the artifacts (files and configurations) to avoid detection before proceeding with the DLL hijacking. This aligns with the technique **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
