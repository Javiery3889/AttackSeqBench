### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Mules are recruited to create fraudulent accounts.
2. The attackers gain unauthorized access to the bank's systems.
3. The attackers install the 'Mipko' monitoring tool on the processor's network.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the attackers in gaining unauthorized access to the bank's systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute code or scripts. While it can be used to deploy malware, it is not typically used to gain initial access to a system.

- **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. Given that mules are creating fraudulent accounts, it is plausible that these accounts are used to gain initial access to the bank's systems.

- **C: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious content into web pages or applications. While it can be used to spread malware, it is not typically used to gain initial access to a system.

- **D: T1543.005-Container Service**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating container services to maintain persistence. It is not typically used to gain initial access to a system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Recruitment of Mules**: The attackers recruit mules to create fraudulent accounts.
2. **Gaining Access**: The mules use these fraudulent accounts to gain access to the bank's systems.
3. **Installing Malware**: Once access is gained, the attackers install the 'Mipko' monitoring tool.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique for gaining unauthorized access is using valid accounts (T1078). The fraudulent accounts created by the mules would provide the necessary credentials for the attackers to log in and gain access to the bank's systems.

**Final Answer: B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
