### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Stuxnet.
   - Stuxnet exploited the MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities for privilege escalation.
   - After privilege escalation, Stuxnet needed to ensure that a kernel-mode driver was loaded early during the OS boot process to maintain control over infected systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1542.001-System Firmware**
     - This technique involves modifying system firmware to maintain persistence. While this could be a method to ensure early loading of a driver, it is not typically the immediate next step after privilege escalation.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
     - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. This is not directly related to ensuring early driver loading or maintaining control over the system.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code when certain events occur. This could be used to ensure that the kernel-mode driver is loaded early during the boot process, but it is not the most specific technique for this context.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
     - This technique involves modifying the boot process to ensure that malicious code is executed before the operating system loads. This is the most relevant technique for ensuring that a kernel-mode driver is loaded early during the boot process to maintain control over the system.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1:** Stuxnet exploited vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to gain higher privileges.
   - **Step 2:** After gaining higher privileges, the next logical step would be to ensure that the malicious code (kernel-mode driver) is loaded early in the boot process to maintain control over the system.
   - **Step 3:** The technique that best fits this requirement is T1542-Pre-OS Boot, as it involves modifying the boot process to ensure early execution of malicious code.

**Final Answer: D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
