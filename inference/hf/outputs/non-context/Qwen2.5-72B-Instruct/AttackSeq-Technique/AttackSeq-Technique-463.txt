### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra gained initial access to Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
   - The key elements are:
     - Initial access method: Spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     - The sequence of events: What happened before the initial access?

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587 - Develop Capabilities:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying tools, malware, or other capabilities to support operations.
     - While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs well before the initial access and is not directly related to the method of gaining initial access.
   - **B: T1133 - External Remote Services:**
     - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., SSH, RDP) to gain access to a network.
     - This is not relevant to the initial access method described in the question, which is spear phishing.
   - **C: T1082 - System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and network configuration.
     - This typically occurs after gaining initial access, not before.
   - **D: T1566 - Phishing:**
     - This technique involves sending spear phishing emails to gain initial access to a network.
     - This is directly related to the method described in the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Hidden Cobra used T1566 (Phishing) to gain initial access to the Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
