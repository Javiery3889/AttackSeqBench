### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Shuckworm initially gains access through a malicious document. After gaining access, they execute VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and operate their backdoor.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Initial Access: Malicious document
  - Post-Access: Execution of VBS scripts and HTA files

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1078.003 - Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of local accounts to gain access to systems. While it is a valid technique, it is typically used for lateral movement or maintaining access, not for the initial execution of scripts and files.
- **Answer Choice B: T1027.002 - Software Packing**
  - This technique involves obfuscating or packing malicious code to evade detection. While it is relevant to the initial malicious document, it does not directly relate to the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files.
- **Answer Choice C: T1566 - Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it is a common method for delivering malicious documents, it is not the next step after gaining access.
- **Answer Choice D: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code runs automatically at boot or logon. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and aligns well with the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain the attacker's presence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access is gained through a malicious document, which is likely delivered via phishing (T1566).
  - After gaining access, the attacker needs to maintain their presence and ensure that their backdoor remains active.
  - Setting up autostart execution (T1547) is a logical next step to ensure that the VBS scripts and HTA files are executed automatically, maintaining the attacker's presence and backdoor.
- **Conclusion**:
  - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through a malicious document, the attacker sets up boot or logon autostart execution to maintain their presence and operate their backdoor.

**Final Answer: D: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
