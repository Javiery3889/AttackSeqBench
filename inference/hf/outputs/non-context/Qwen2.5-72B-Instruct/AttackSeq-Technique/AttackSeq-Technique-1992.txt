### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before SkinnyBoy established C2 (Command and Control) communication with `updaterweb[.]com` by sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - Data Obfuscation involves altering data to make it less recognizable or understandable. This technique is often used to hide the true nature of the data being exfiltrated. However, it is not a necessary step before establishing C2 communication. It can be used to protect the data during exfiltration but is not a prerequisite for C2 communication.

- **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
  - Socket Filters are a type of network filtering technique that can be used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This technique is more about intercepting and modifying traffic rather than establishing C2 communication. It is not a typical step before C2 communication.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - Application Layer Protocol involves using standard protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a crucial step in establishing C2 communication, as it defines the method by which the malware will send and receive data. Establishing C2 communication using a structured POST request is a clear example of using an application layer protocol.

- **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - System Owner/User Discovery involves identifying the user or system owner. This technique is typically used early in the attack to gather information about the target environment. While it is a useful technique, it is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Obfuscation (T1001)**: While useful for protecting exfiltrated data, it is not a necessary step before establishing C2 communication.
2. **Socket Filters (T1205.002)**: This technique is more about intercepting and modifying traffic, not establishing C2 communication.
3. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**: This is the most relevant technique, as it directly involves using a standard protocol to communicate with the C2 server, which is necessary for sending exfiltrated data in a structured POST request.
4. **System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)**: This technique is useful for gathering information but is not directly related to establishing C2 communication.

### Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
