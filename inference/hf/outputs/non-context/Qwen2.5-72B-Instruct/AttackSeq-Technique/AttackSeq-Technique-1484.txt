### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Babar implant.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Reducing forensic artifacts by executing a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from the disk.
     2. Actively stealing data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1559 - Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves using mechanisms to communicate between processes, which could be relevant if the implant is using IPC to coordinate its activities. However, it doesn't directly fit the context of reducing forensic artifacts or stealing data.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1021.004 - SSH**
     - This technique involves using SSH for remote access. It is not relevant to the described sequence of reducing forensic artifacts or stealing data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. This could be relevant if the implant is trying to hide its activities, but it doesn't directly fit the context of the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1578.005 - Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**
     - This technique involves modifying cloud compute configurations, which is not relevant to the described sequence of reducing forensic artifacts or stealing data.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves:
     1. **Reducing Forensic Artifacts:** The implant executes a `cmd.exe` process to delete the dropper binary from the disk. This is an example of **T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host**.
     2. **Stealing Data:** The implant uses global Windows hooks and a keylogger module to steal data from applications. This is an example of **T1056 - Input Capture**.
   - The question asks for the technique that occurred between these two steps.
   - Given the context, the most plausible technique that fits between these two steps is **T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**. This is because the implant might obfuscate its activities to avoid detection while it is preparing to steal data.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information
