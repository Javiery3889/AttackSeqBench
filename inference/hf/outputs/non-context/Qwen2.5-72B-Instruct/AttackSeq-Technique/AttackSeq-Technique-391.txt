### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Vyveva's backdoor uses Discovery capabilities to gather information about running processes, system information, and the local IP address.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine the system time and time zone.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active network connections on the system. It is not related to determining the system time and time zone.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1124-System Time Discovery**
     - This technique specifically involves determining the system time and time zone, which aligns perfectly with the next step in the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
     - This technique involves finding and using unsecured credentials, which is not related to determining the system time and time zone.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1569-System Services**
     - This technique involves manipulating system services, which is not related to determining the system time and time zone.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the backdoor has already gathered information about running processes, system information, and the local IP address.
   - The next logical step in the sequence is to determine the system time and time zone.
   - Among the given answer choices, only T1124-System Time Discovery directly addresses this requirement.

**Final Answer: B: T1124-System Time Discovery**
