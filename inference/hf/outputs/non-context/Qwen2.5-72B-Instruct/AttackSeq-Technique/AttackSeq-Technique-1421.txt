### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving ChromeLoader and Gimmick. Specifically:
1. ChromeLoader used a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic for C2 (Command and Control).
2. Gimmick leveraged cloud hosting services like Google Drive for C2 communication.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services for C2. While Gimmick leveraged cloud hosting services like Google Drive, this technique is more about using web services in general. It doesn't specifically align with the sequence described.

- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supply chain to gain access to the target. This does not fit the sequence of intercepting browser traffic and using cloud hosting services for C2.

- **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate C2 communications. This could be a plausible next step after establishing C2 communication, as the attacker might want to hide the traffic from detection.

- **D: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file. This does not fit the sequence of intercepting browser traffic and using cloud hosting services for C2.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Intercepting Browser Traffic (ChromeLoader)**: This is the initial step where ChromeLoader sets up a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic for C2.
2. **Using Cloud Hosting Services (Gimmick)**: Gimmick then leverages cloud hosting services like Google Drive for C2 communication.
3. **Next Step**: After establishing C2 communication, the attacker might want to obfuscate the traffic to avoid detection. This aligns with the technique **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**.

**Final Answer: C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
