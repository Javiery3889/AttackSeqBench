### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the GreyEnergy group:
1. Development of modular espionage tools for tasks like keylogging and file extraction.
2. Employment of distinct infection vectors such as spearphishing and compromised web servers for initial access.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two stages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1590.005-IP Addresses**
  - This technique involves collecting IP addresses from the victim's network. This is typically done after gaining initial access to understand the network topology. It doesn't fit well between the development of tools and the initial access stage.

- **B: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - This technique involves modifying authentication mechanisms to use reversible encryption. This is more relevant to maintaining persistence and is not typically a step taken before initial access.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This is a common step taken after gaining initial access to maintain stealth. However, it doesn't fit well between the development of tools and the initial access stage.

- **D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the victim organization, such as network structure, employee details, and other relevant data. This is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase, which typically occurs before initial access. It fits well between the development of tools and the initial access stage.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Development of Tools**: GreyEnergy develops modular espionage tools for keylogging and file extraction.
2. **Gather Victim Org Information (T1591)**: Before employing infection vectors, the group gathers information about the target organization to tailor their attack.
3. **Initial Access**: The group uses spearphishing and compromised web servers to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: D: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
