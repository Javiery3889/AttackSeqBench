### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where malware evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker using InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, and then executes its payload via proxy execution. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this sequence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain initial access. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about what happens after the malware has already evaded detection and executed its payload.

- **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique involves reducing the number of possible keys in a cryptographic attack, which is not relevant to the context of the question. The question is about the execution of malware after it has evaded detection, not about cryptographic attacks.

- **C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - Non-Standard Encoding is a technique used to obfuscate data or commands to evade detection. While this could be used in the initial stages of an attack to evade detection, the question specifically asks about what happens after the malware has already evaded detection and executed its payload. This technique is not the most likely to occur after the described sequence.

- **D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**
  - Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution involves using trusted utilities, such as InstallUtil.exe, to execute malicious code. This technique aligns perfectly with the described sequence where the malware uses InstallUtil.exe to execute its payload. Since the question asks about what happens after the malware has already evaded detection and executed its payload, this technique is the most plausible.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware evades detection by SmartScreen and AppLocker.
2. It uses InstallUtil.exe, a trusted .NET utility, to execute its payload.
3. The question asks what technique most likely occurred after this sequence.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that occurred after the malware evaded detection and executed its payload using InstallUtil.exe is **T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution**.

Final Answer: D: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution
