### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by Hidden Cobra, a known threat actor, involving the use of the Bankshot implant in a spear phishing campaign.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Spear Phishing**: The use of a malicious Word document in targeted emails.
  - **Exploitation**: The Bankshot implant exploits CVE-2018-4878 using an embedded Flash script.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1588.005-Exploits**
  - This technique involves the acquisition of exploits, which is a step that would typically occur before the actual exploitation. However, the question is asking about the technique that occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2018-4878, not the acquisition of the exploit itself.

- **Answer Choice B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves setting up the necessary infrastructure for an attack, such as registering domains, setting up servers, etc. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question, which focuses on the spear phishing and exploitation phases.

- **Answer Choice C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the target organization, which is often a precursor to a spear phishing campaign. This information can be used to craft more convincing and targeted phishing emails. This aligns well with the context of the question, as it would be logical for the attackers to gather information about the target before sending the spear phishing emails.

- **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. While this can be a part of the attack, it is not typically a step that occurs before the initial spear phishing and exploitation phases.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Spear Phishing**: The attackers send a malicious Word document via targeted emails.
2. **Exploitation**: The Bankshot implant exploits CVE-2018-4878 using an embedded Flash script.
3. **Preparation**: Before sending the spear phishing emails, the attackers would need to gather information about the target organization to make the emails more convincing.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred before the Bankshot implant exploited CVE-2018-4878 is the gathering of victim organization information.

**Final Answer: C: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**
