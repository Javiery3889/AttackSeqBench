### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the BlackSoul malware:
1. It exfiltrated data using a C2 channel over RESTful Strapi protocol with JSON encoding.
2. Before exfiltration, it searched victim machines for specific browser data.
3. The gathered information was returned in JSON format.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which could include browser data. This aligns well with the step where BlackSoul searches for specific browser data on the victim machine.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. While this could be a part of the malware's overall strategy, it does not specifically describe the act of searching for and collecting browser data.

- **C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
  - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to communicate with a C2 server. While it is related to C2 communication, it does not describe the act of searching for and collecting browser data.

- **D: T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule**
  - This technique involves creating email forwarding rules to exfiltrate data. This is not relevant to the act of searching for and collecting browser data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question specifies that BlackSoul searched for specific browser data on the victim machine.
2. The technique that best describes this action is T1005-Data from Local System, as it involves collecting data from the local system.
3. The other techniques (T1027, T1102.001, and T1114.003) do not directly relate to the act of searching for and collecting browser data.

**Final Answer: A: T1005-Data from Local System**
