### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has achieved lateral movement by exploiting vulnerabilities such as MS08-067 and MS10-061. The next step in the attack sequence involves sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1608.002-Upload Tool**
  - This technique involves uploading a tool to a remote system. While this could be part of the attack, it does not specifically describe the act of sending data or receiving commands from predefined URLs.

- **B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as modifying security settings or bypassing security mechanisms. This does not align with the act of sending data or receiving commands from predefined URLs.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. This aligns well with the act of sending data and receiving commands or updates from predefined URLs, as these protocols are commonly used for such communications.

- **D: T1001.003-Protocol or Service Impersonation**
  - This technique involves impersonating a protocol or service to avoid detection. While this could be used to mask the communication, it does not directly describe the act of sending data or receiving commands from predefined URLs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already achieved lateral movement and is now communicating with a remote server to send data and receive commands or updates.
- The most relevant technique for this communication is the use of standard application layer protocols, which is described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
- T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible choice because it directly addresses the communication aspect of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
