### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence where CosmicDuke, after using Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives, gathers information from removable drives while skipping certain file types.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Discovery techniques to identify targeted files.
  - Gathering information from removable drives.
  - Skipping certain file types.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1127.002-ClickOnce**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using ClickOnce, a deployment technology for publishing Windows-based applications to a web server or network file share.
  - **Relevance**: This does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.

- **Answer Choice B: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials.
  - **Relevance**: This does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.

- **Answer Choice C: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
  - **Description**: This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Relevance**: This does not align with the described sequence of gathering information from removable drives.

- **Answer Choice D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - **Description**: This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other removable storage devices.
  - **Relevance**: This aligns perfectly with the described sequence where CosmicDuke gathers information from removable drives while skipping certain file types.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Techniques**: CosmicDuke uses Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives.
2. **Gathering Information from Removable Drives**: After identifying the files, CosmicDuke gathers information from removable drives.
3. **Skipping Certain File Types**: While gathering information, CosmicDuke skips certain file types.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible ATT&CK technique is T1025, which involves collecting data from removable media.

**Final Answer: D: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
