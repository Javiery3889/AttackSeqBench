### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tortoiseshell group:
1. They used malware to confirm that Google was reachable, which suggests they were checking for internet connectivity and possibly ensuring they could bypass network-based defenses.
2. They then used a reconnaissance tool called 'bird.exe' to collect detailed system information for further attacks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one fits best in the sequence described:

- **A: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - Internal spearphishing involves sending targeted phishing messages to individuals within an organization to gain access or information. This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain a foothold. It does not fit well between confirming internet connectivity and collecting system information.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Like internal spearphishing, this technique is used in the initial stages of an attack. It does not fit well between confirming internet connectivity and collecting system information.

- **C: T1134-Access Token Manipulation**
  - Access token manipulation involves altering or using access tokens to gain higher privileges or access to resources. This technique is often used after gaining initial access to a system to escalate privileges. It could fit between confirming internet connectivity and collecting system information, as the attackers might need higher privileges to gather detailed system information.

- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - Virtualization/sandbox evasion involves techniques to detect and avoid virtualized environments or sandboxes, which are often used by security researchers to analyze malware. This technique is typically used to ensure that the malware can run undetected. It fits well between confirming internet connectivity and collecting system information, as the attackers would want to ensure their tools are not being analyzed in a controlled environment.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence described involves confirming internet connectivity and then collecting system information.
2. Between these two actions, the attackers would likely want to ensure their tools are not being detected or analyzed in a controlled environment.
3. T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion fits this requirement, as it helps the attackers avoid detection and ensures their tools can run effectively.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
