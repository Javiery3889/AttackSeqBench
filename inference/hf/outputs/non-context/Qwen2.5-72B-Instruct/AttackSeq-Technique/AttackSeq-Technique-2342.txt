### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerPoint add-in document containing an auto-open VBA macro is delivered.
- The next step in the sequence involves the use of `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the use of `mshta.exe`.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing involves tricking users into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links. This could be the initial step where the user is tricked into opening the PowerPoint add-in document.
- **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves the use of legitimate command shells and scripting languages to execute commands. While this could be relevant, it is more likely to be used after the initial delivery and execution of the VBA macro.
- **Answer Choice C: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL. This is not directly related to the initial delivery of the PowerPoint add-in or the use of `mshta.exe`.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This is the same as Answer Choice B and is not the most likely initial step in the sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step in the attack sequence is likely the delivery of the malicious PowerPoint add-in document to the user.
2. The user is tricked into opening the document, which contains an auto-open VBA macro.
3. The VBA macro is executed, which then uses `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
4. The technique that most likely occurred before the use of `mshta.exe` is the initial delivery and tricking of the user, which is a phishing attack (T1566).

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
