### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an APT group uses DLL side-loading for defense evasion. DLL side-loading involves loading malicious DLLs through renamed clean loaders, which are legitimate Windows executables. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during the execution phase to allow the APT group to execute malicious code via these legitimate executables.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1204.002-Malicious File**
  - This technique involves tricking users into opening a malicious file, typically through social engineering. It does not align with the scenario of using legitimate executables to load malicious DLLs.

- **B: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared libraries (DLLs) to execute code. It is directly related to the scenario of loading malicious DLLs through legitimate executables, which is a form of DLL side-loading.

- **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to distribute malicious code. While it can be a method to deliver malicious DLLs, it does not specifically describe the execution phase where the DLLs are loaded by legitimate executables.

- **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. It is not relevant to the execution of malicious code via legitimate executables.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes the use of DLL side-loading, which involves loading malicious DLLs through legitimate Windows executables.
- The technique that best aligns with this scenario is **T1129-Shared Modules**, as it specifically involves using shared libraries (DLLs) to execute code.
- The other answer choices do not directly address the execution phase of loading malicious DLLs via legitimate executables.

**Final Answer: B: T1129-Shared Modules**
