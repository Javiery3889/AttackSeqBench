### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where BlueBravo's malware gathers system information, including network connections and running processes.
- The next step in the sequence involves bidirectional communication with C2 servers using HTTPS protocol, encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the true destination of the C2 traffic. While it can be used for communication, it is not specifically about the protocol or encryption used.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (like HTTPS) to communicate with C2 servers. The use of HTTPS, RC4, and Base64 encoding aligns well with this technique.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1546.009-AppCert DLLs**
  - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL during the system boot process to maintain persistence. It is not related to communication with C2 servers.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about communication protocols or encryption.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware gathers system information, which is a common initial step in many attacks.
- The next step involves communication with C2 servers using HTTPS, which is a standard application layer protocol.
- The use of RC4 and Base64 encoding for encryption and encoding is a common method to obfuscate the communication.
- Among the given choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the use of standard protocols like HTTPS for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
