### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Hacking Team's spyware gained initial access by disguising an executable file as a PDF document and delivered via a spearphishing email.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Initial Access**: Spearphishing email with a disguised executable file.
  - **Next Step**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after gaining initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1036-Masquerading**
  - **Description**: Masquerading involves renaming or modifying the attributes of a file or service to make it appear legitimate or benign.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be used to disguise the executable file as a PDF document, which aligns with the initial access method described.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: Phishing involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions through deceptive emails or messages.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to deliver the initial payload (the disguised executable file) via a spearphishing email. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **after** gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - **Description**: Process hollowing involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process, which could be a plausible next step after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice D: T1647-Plist File Modification**
  - **Description**: Plist file modification involves altering property list files to change the behavior of applications or services.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining initial access, as it is more specific to modifying application settings on macOS.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a spearphishing email containing a disguised executable file.
2. **Next Step**: After the user executes the disguised file, the malware needs to establish a foothold and execute its payload.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique is used to disguise the file initially, but the question asks for the next step after gaining access.
   - **T1566-Phishing**: This is the initial access method, not the next step.
   - **T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This is a plausible next step to execute the malware in a stealthy manner.
   - **T1647-Plist File Modification**: This is less likely to be the immediate next step.

**Final Answer: C: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
