### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where adversaries have already discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials to enable legitimate access within the target network. The next step in the attack sequence is to move across the network to further their objectives. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique best fits this stage of the attack.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control (C2) capabilities. While this is a valid technique, it is more about maintaining access and communication rather than moving laterally across the network.

- **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**
  - This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies to gain or maintain access. This is more about altering the environment to facilitate further attacks rather than moving laterally.

- **C: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network. While it is a valid lateral movement technique, it is specific to cloud environments and may not be the most general answer.

- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network. This is a common method for lateral movement and aligns well with the scenario of moving across the network to further objectives.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery and Initial Access**: The adversaries have already discovered critical systems and gained valid credentials.
2. **Legitimate Access**: They are using these credentials to access the network.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The next logical step is to move laterally across the network to further their objectives.
4. **Evaluation of Techniques**:
   - **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**: Not the best fit for lateral movement.
   - **T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**: Not directly related to lateral movement.
   - **T1021.007-Cloud Services**: Specific to cloud environments.
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**: Best fits the scenario of moving laterally across the network.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
