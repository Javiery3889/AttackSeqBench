### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Trojan) disguises its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger.
- The goal is to hinder detection, and the question specifically asks about encryption manipulation.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1600-Weaken Encryption**
  - This technique involves reducing the strength of encryption to make it easier to intercept or decrypt. However, the question does not mention weakening encryption, but rather disguising traffic to look like legitimate protocols.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1053.003-Cron**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the cron utility, which is not related to network traffic or encryption manipulation.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. The question specifically mentions that the FAKEM RAT disguises its traffic to look like legitimate protocols, which aligns with this technique.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1562.007-Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall**
  - This technique involves altering or disabling cloud firewalls to allow malicious traffic. While this could help in evading detection, it does not directly relate to the manipulation of network traffic to look like legitimate protocols.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the FAKEM RAT disguising its network traffic to look like legitimate protocols such as Windows Messenger or Yahoo! Messenger.
- The goal is to hinder detection, and the technique that best fits this description is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
- T1071 involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server, which aligns with the described behavior of the FAKEM RAT.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
