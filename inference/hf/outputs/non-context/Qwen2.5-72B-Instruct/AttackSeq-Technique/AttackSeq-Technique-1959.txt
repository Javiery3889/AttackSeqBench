### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a threat actor uses stolen credentials to persist via VPN access and then configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the threat actor achieved persistence by configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1036-Masquerading**
  - Masquerading involves renaming or modifying the attributes of files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate or to hide their true nature. This technique is often used to avoid detection but is not typically a prerequisite for achieving persistence via WMI.

- **B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
  - Scanning IP blocks is a reconnaissance technique used to identify potential targets. While this is a common initial step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the sequence of using stolen credentials and configuring WMI persistence.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - External Remote Services involves using legitimate remote access services, such as a VPN, to gain access to a network. This aligns well with the scenario where the threat actor uses stolen credentials to persist via VPN access.

- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - Valid Accounts involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. This is a crucial step before configuring WMI persistence, as the threat actor needs to have valid credentials to perform actions on the system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actor uses stolen credentials to gain access to the network via a VPN.
2. Once inside the network, the threat actor configures TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
3. The use of stolen credentials (T1078-Valid Accounts) is a necessary step before the threat actor can configure WMI persistence.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor used valid accounts (T1078) before configuring WMI persistence.

**Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
