### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group named APT-TOCS. The sequence includes:
1. Downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell.
2. Maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion.
3. Establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1654-Log Enumeration**
  - This technique involves adversaries enumerating log files to find information that might be useful for follow-on objectives. This does not align with the described sequence of establishing secure communication.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves adversaries using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While PowerShell is mentioned in the question, this technique is more about the initial execution rather than the secure communication.

- **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
  - This sub-technique involves the use of symmetric cryptography to protect data in transit. While it is related to secure communication, it is a specific method of encryption and not the broader technique of establishing an encrypted channel.

- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves adversaries using encrypted channels to protect their C2 (Command and Control) communications. This aligns well with the described sequence of establishing secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence of TTPs involves downloading Shellcode script functionalities via PowerShell and maintaining multi-beacon communication for evasion.
2. The next step is to establish secure communication using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.
3. Among the answer choices, T1573-Encrypted Channel is the most relevant because it directly addresses the establishment of secure communication, which is a critical step in maintaining C2 communications.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
