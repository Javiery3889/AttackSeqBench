### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial compromise is achieved through spear-phishing campaigns using RAR-compressed executables or Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to install NetTraveler.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the actor's ability to direct communications to their C&C infrastructure, which mimics news and military sites.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Spear-phishing with RAR-compressed executables or Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - **Malware Installation:** Installation of NetTraveler.
   - **C&C Communication:** Directing communications to C&C infrastructure that mimics news and military sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**

   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves the use of dynamic DNS (DDNS) or other dynamic resolution methods to resolve C&C server addresses. This can help in maintaining a persistent and flexible C&C infrastructure.
     - **Relevance:** This technique is highly relevant because it can be used to dynamically resolve the C&C server addresses, making it difficult for defenders to block or track the C&C communication. It aligns well with the need to mimic news and military sites, as it can dynamically change the C&C server's address to avoid detection.

   - **B: T1092-Communication Through Removable Media:**
     - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to exfiltrate data or communicate with the C&C server.
     - **Relevance:** This technique is less relevant to the scenario described, as it does not involve network communication and does not align with the need to mimic news and military sites.

   - **C: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access to a victim's system.
     - **Relevance:** While phishing is part of the initial compromise, it does not directly facilitate the C&C communication. The question is specifically asking about the technique used to direct communications to the C&C infrastructure.

   - **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates:**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access to systems or services.
     - **Relevance:** This technique is not directly related to C&C communication. It is more about gaining access or maintaining persistence, not about directing communications to a C&C infrastructure.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible technique that facilitates the actor's ability to direct communications to their C&C infrastructure, which mimics news and military sites, is **T1568-Dynamic Resolution**. This technique allows for dynamic and flexible resolution of C&C server addresses, making it difficult for defenders to block or track the communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
