### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained via a spear-phishing email with a trojanized legitimate software installer.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware performed discovery activities like collecting system, network, and task information on the victim host.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing email with a trojanized legitimate software installer.
   - Discovery Activities: Collecting system, network, and task information on the victim host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active network connections on the victim host. While this is a discovery activity, it is more specific to network connections and might occur after initial discovery activities.

   - **B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
     - This technique involves collecting a broad range of information about the victim host, including system, network, and task information. This aligns well with the described discovery activities.

   - **C: T1595.002-Vulnerability Scanning**
     - This technique involves scanning the victim host for vulnerabilities. While this is a common post-compromise activity, it is more focused on identifying weaknesses rather than general information gathering.

   - **D: T1136.002-Domain Account**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying domain accounts. This is more related to persistence and lateral movement rather than initial discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained via a spear-phishing email with a trojanized legitimate software installer.
   - After gaining access, the malware would likely perform broad discovery activities to understand the environment it has compromised.
   - The most comprehensive and relevant technique for this initial discovery phase is T1592-Gather Victim Host Information, as it covers a wide range of information collection activities.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information
