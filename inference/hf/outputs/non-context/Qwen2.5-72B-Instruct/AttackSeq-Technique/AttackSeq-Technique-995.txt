### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the FIN7 group. The sequence includes:
1. Deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
2. Conducting data exfiltration using the SmartFTP Client during the Collection stage.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike but before the data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497.001-System Checks**
  - This technique involves checking the system for specific conditions or configurations. While it can be part of reconnaissance, it is more specific and less likely to be the next step after deploying Cobalt Strike for broader network reconnaissance and data discovery.

- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network. After deploying Cobalt Strike, it is logical to perform remote system discovery to understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

- **C: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions to gain unauthorized access. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is not a typical next step after deploying Cobalt Strike for network reconnaissance and data discovery.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically tied to the reconnaissance and data discovery phase that follows deploying Cobalt Strike.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Deploying Cobalt Strike**: This is the initial step for network reconnaissance and data discovery.
2. **Remote System Discovery (T1018)**: After deploying Cobalt Strike, the next logical step is to discover remote systems on the network to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
3. **Data Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client**: Once the targets are identified, the attacker can proceed with data exfiltration.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred after deploying Cobalt Strike and before data exfiltration is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
