### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using 'versioninfo.bat' for discovering and collecting system information.
     - Using 'unactivate.vbs' for data exfiltration through a POST request.
     - Initiating communication with the C2 server via HTTP using 'activate.vbs'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1654 - Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves adversaries enumerating and searching for log files to gather information.
     - While log enumeration can be part of an attack, it is not typically a prerequisite for initiating C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server.
     - This is a plausible choice because the question mentions communication with the C2 server via HTTP.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**
     - This technique involves adversaries creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute their tools or malware at specific times.
     - This could be a plausible choice if the communication with the C2 server is scheduled, but the question does not provide evidence of scheduling.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1219 - Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate remote access software to maintain persistence and command and control.
     - This is less likely to be the immediate step before C2 communication, as it is more about maintaining access rather than initiating communication.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves collecting system information, exfiltrating data, and then communicating with the C2 server.
   - The most logical step before initiating C2 communication via HTTP would be to use an application layer protocol to establish the connection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
