### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where "mic.exe" is executed to load and decrypt associated files.
- After this, the "mic.ver" configuration file is decoded.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the communication with the C&C server after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves altering data to make it harder to understand. While it can be used to obfuscate data sent to a C&C server, it is not specifically about communication protocols.
- **T1027.013-Encrypted/Encoded File**: This technique involves encrypting or encoding files to hide their content. It is more about protecting the data at rest or in transit, but not specifically about the communication method.
- **T1071.001-Web Protocols**: This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS) to communicate with a C&C server. This is directly related to the communication method.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This is a broader category that includes various methods of obfuscation, but it does not specifically address communication protocols.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution and Decryption**: "mic.exe" is executed to load and decrypt associated files.
2. **Decoding Configuration File**: The "mic.ver" configuration file is decoded, which likely contains information about the C&C server.
3. **Communication with C&C Server**: After decoding the configuration file, the next logical step is to establish communication with the C&C server.

Given the context, the most plausible technique for facilitating communication with the C&C server is using web protocols, as this is a common method for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
