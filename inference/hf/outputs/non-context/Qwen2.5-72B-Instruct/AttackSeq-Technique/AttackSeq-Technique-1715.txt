### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Mustang Panda uses spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files and the double extension trick for initial access and defense evasion.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Initial Access**: Spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files.
  - **Defense Evasion**: Double extension trick.
  - **Next Step**: Communication with compromised systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. Common protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.
  - **Relevance**: After gaining initial access and evading defenses, an attacker would need to establish communication with the compromised system. Using standard application layer protocols is a common method for this.

- **Answer Choice B: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate command and control (C2) communications.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used for C2 communication, it is more about obfuscation rather than the initial establishment of communication.

- **Answer Choice C: T1010-Application Window Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering open application windows on a system to gather information.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about reconnaissance and does not directly relate to establishing communication with a compromised system.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial access phase and is not relevant to the next step of communication with the compromised system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Mustang Panda uses spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files to gain initial access.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The double extension trick is used to evade defenses.
3. **Next Step**: The attacker needs to establish communication with the compromised system.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique for establishing communication with the compromised system.
   - **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding** is about obfuscation, not initial communication.
   - **T1010-Application Window Discovery** is about reconnaissance, not communication.
   - **T1566-Phishing** is already part of the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
