### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has:
1. Staged data collected from network shared drives.
2. Archived the data using specific utilities.
3. Needs to enable the transfer of tools and communication within the network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1090-Proxy**
  - **Description**: T1090 involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
  - **Relevance**: While proxies can be used to hide the origin of traffic, they are not typically used for transferring tools and communication within a network. This technique is more about routing and obfuscation.

- **B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition**
  - **Description**: T1546.006 involves modifying the load commands of a Mach-O binary to load a malicious dynamic library (dylib) at runtime.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to macOS and is used for persistence and execution of malicious code. It does not directly relate to transferring tools or communication within a network.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - **Description**: T1021 involves using legitimate remote services such as SSH, RDP, or SMB to move laterally within a network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the scenario. After staging and archiving data, the attacker would need a way to transfer the tools and communicate within the network. Remote services like RDP or SMB are commonly used for this purpose.

- **D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: T1665 involves techniques to hide the infrastructure used in an attack, such as using domain fronting or other methods to mask the true origin of traffic.
  - **Relevance**: While hiding infrastructure is important for maintaining stealth, it does not directly address the need to transfer tools and communicate within the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has staged and archived data from network shared drives.
2. The next logical step is to transfer the tools and communicate within the network.
3. Among the given options, T1021-Remote Services is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves using legitimate remote services to move laterally and transfer files.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
