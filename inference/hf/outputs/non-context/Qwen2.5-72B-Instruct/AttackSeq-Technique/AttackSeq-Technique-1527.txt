### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus Group:
1. **Initial Access**: Spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents masquerading as job opportunities.
2. **Persistence**: Dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process. It is typically used for process manipulation and evasion, but it is not a common next step after initial access and before achieving persistence.

- **B: T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft**
  - This technique involves stealing and using access tokens to gain higher privileges. While it can be used after initial access, it is more commonly used for privilege escalation rather than directly leading to persistence.

- **C: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. It is often used to gather information about the environment and can be a logical step after gaining initial access to understand the system before taking further actions.

- **D: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs to run malicious code. It can be used to achieve persistence, but it is more of a persistence technique itself rather than a step leading to persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access**: The Lazarus Group gains initial access through a spear-phishing campaign with macro-embedded documents.
2. **Process Discovery**: After gaining access, the attackers need to understand the environment and identify running processes to plan their next steps.
3. **Persistence**: The attackers then achieve persistence by dropping a malicious LNK file into the startup folder.

Given this sequence, the most logical step between initial access and persistence is **Process Discovery** (T1057).

### Final Answer: C: T1057-Process Discovery
