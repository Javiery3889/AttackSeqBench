### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in the FHAPPI campaign:
1. A VBScript is used to create an object in the shell.
2. The VBScript executes a PowerShell command.
3. The PowerShell command runs base64 encoded infection code.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1059.011-Lua**
  - This technique involves the use of Lua scripting language for command and scripting interpretation. The question does not mention the use of Lua, so this is not a plausible choice.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves the use of various command shells and scripting languages to execute commands and scripts. The question mentions the use of VBScript and PowerShell, which are both command and scripting interpreters. This is a strong candidate.

- **C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or information. The question mentions the use of base64 encoded infection code, which is a form of obfuscation. This is also a strong candidate.

- **D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
  - This technique involves the use of ROMMONkit, which is a type of firmware-level malware. The question does not mention any firmware-level activities, so this is not a plausible choice.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the use of VBScript and PowerShell to execute base64 encoded infection code.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** (B) is a broad technique that covers the use of VBScript and PowerShell, which are both scripting interpreters.
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information** (C) is also relevant because the base64 encoded infection code is a form of obfuscation.
- However, the question specifically asks for the technique that most likely occurred **after** the VBScript and PowerShell execution. The use of base64 encoding (obfuscation) is a logical next step in the attack sequence to hide the malicious payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
