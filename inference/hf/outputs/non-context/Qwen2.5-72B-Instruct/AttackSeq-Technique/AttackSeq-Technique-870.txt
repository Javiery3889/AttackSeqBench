### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - Key points:
     - GreyEnergy deployed selected modules to selected targets.
     - These modules were partially encrypted using AES-256 for Defense Evasion.
     - After this, they used internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to the external C&C server for Lateral Movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is not directly related to the deployment of modules or the use of C&C proxies.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1564.002-Hidden Users**
     - This technique involves creating hidden users to maintain persistence, which is not directly related to the deployment of modules or the use of C&C proxies.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection, which aligns with the partial encryption of modules using AES-256 for Defense Evasion.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1584.008-Network Devices**
     - This technique involves targeting network devices, which is not directly related to the deployment of modules or the use of C&C proxies.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Deploying selected modules to selected targets.
     2. Partially encrypting these modules using AES-256 for Defense Evasion.
     3. Using internal C&C proxies to redirect requests for Lateral Movement.
   - The technique that best fits the step of partially encrypting modules for Defense Evasion is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information occurred after the deployment of modules and before the use of internal C&C proxies for Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
