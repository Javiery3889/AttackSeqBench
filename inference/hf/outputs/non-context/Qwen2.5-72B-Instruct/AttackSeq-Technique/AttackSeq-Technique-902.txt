### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack:
1. Successful execution of macros from a malicious Office document.
2. Evading defenses with in-memory payload decryption.
3. Establishing communication to download a payload.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred when KerrDown established communication to download its payload.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. This is a plausible technique for establishing communication to download a payload.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with a remote server. While this can be used to download a payload, it is more specific to using web services, which may not be the most general term for the communication described.

- **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
  - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is typically used to reveal the actual payload or commands. This is not directly related to establishing communication to download a payload.

- **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
  - This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which is not relevant to the communication and payload download described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence involves executing macros, evading defenses, and then establishing communication to download a payload.
2. The most relevant technique for establishing communication to download a payload is using application layer protocols, which is described by T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
3. The other techniques (T1102, T1140, and T1591.001) do not align as closely with the described sequence of events.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
