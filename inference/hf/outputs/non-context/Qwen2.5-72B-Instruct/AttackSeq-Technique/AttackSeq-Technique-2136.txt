### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where scripts like 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' are used to schedule tasks or manage file deletions as part of Persistence.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique likely occurred after these Persistence activities but before collecting system information for Exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. This is a Persistence technique and is mentioned in the question as part of the initial activities.
- **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**: This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection. This is more related to Defense Evasion and Execution, not typically a step between Persistence and Exfiltration.
- **C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory paths on a system. This is a common step before collecting system information for Exfiltration, as it helps identify what files and directories are available and relevant.
- **D: T1654-Log Enumeration**: This technique involves adversaries enumerating log files to understand the system's activity and potentially cover their tracks. While this can be part of Exfiltration, it is more focused on post-Exfiltration activities to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence Activities**: The scripts 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' are used to schedule tasks or manage file deletions, which align with T1053-Scheduled Task/Job.
2. **Next Step**: After establishing Persistence, the next logical step is to discover what files and directories are available on the system to determine what information to collect for Exfiltration.
3. **Exfiltration**: The final step involves collecting and exfiltrating the discovered information.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurs after Persistence and before Exfiltration is **T1083-File and Directory Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
