### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where Gamaredon's modules use HTTP and HTTPS for command and control (C&C) and then automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **HTTP and HTTPS for C&C**: This indicates the use of standard web protocols for communication with the C&C server.
  - **Automatic Upload of Harvested Documents**: This suggests that the malware is exfiltrating data to the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits**
  - **Description**: This technique involves limiting the size of data transferred to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be a technique used to avoid detection, it does not directly describe the act of exfiltrating data.

- **Answer Choice B: T1137.006-Add-ins**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves using add-ins to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the exfiltration of data over a C&C channel.

- **Answer Choice C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
  - **Relevance**: This directly describes the scenario where harvested documents are uploaded to the C&C server using the same HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

- **Answer Choice D: T1106-Native API**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system.
  - **Relevance**: This is not directly related to the exfiltration of data over a C&C channel.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the use of HTTP and HTTPS for C&C and the automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server.
  - The most relevant technique that describes this behavior is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, as it specifically involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control.
  - The other answer choices do not directly address the exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
