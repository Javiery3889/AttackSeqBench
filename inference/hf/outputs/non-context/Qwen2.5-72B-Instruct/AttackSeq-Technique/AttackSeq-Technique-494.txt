### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign. The sequence is:
1. Creating remote tunnels via SSH tools for redirecting traffic.
2. Executing payload stagers with scheduled tasks.
3. Gaining initial access to victims' environments.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled the initial access to the victims' environments.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This technique involves manipulating or compromising hybrid identity services to gain access. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities rather than initial access.

- **B: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for initial access, it typically requires prior knowledge or compromise of credentials, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering running processes on a system. It is a post-compromise activity used to understand the environment and is not related to initial access.

- **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails through a service (e.g., email, social media) to trick victims into providing credentials or executing malicious content. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a victim's environment.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question asks for the technique that enabled initial access to the victims' environments.
2. **Sequence Analysis**: The sequence described involves creating remote tunnels and executing payload stagers, which are post-compromise activities.
3. **Technique Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity** is not suitable for initial access.
   - **B: T1078-Valid Accounts** could be used for initial access but is less likely without prior compromise.
   - **C: T1057-Process Discovery** is a post-compromise activity.
   - **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** is a common method for gaining initial access through social engineering.

Given the context and the sequence of activities, the most plausible technique for gaining initial access is **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**.

**Final Answer: D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
