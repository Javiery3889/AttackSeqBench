### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware "Infamous Chisel."
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Collecting predefined files of interest from the local system.
     2. Enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
     3. Exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1606.001-Web Cookies**
     - This technique involves collecting web cookies, which are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by websites. This is not relevant to enumerating data directories or gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-layer communication, such as raw sockets or custom protocols. This is more related to the exfiltration phase rather than the enumeration and information gathering phase.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
     - This technique involves gathering information from cloud accounts, which is not relevant to enumerating local data directories or gathering system information.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
     - This technique involves adversaries discovering file and directory information on a system, which is directly relevant to the step of enumerating data directories and gathering system information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question asks for the technique that enables the malware to enumerate data directories and gather system information.
   - Among the given choices, T1083-File and Directory Discovery is the most relevant and aligns best with the described attack sequence.
   - The other choices (T1606.001, T1095, and T1087.004) do not fit the context of the enumeration and information gathering phase.

**Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
