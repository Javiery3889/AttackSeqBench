### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor group Volatile Cedar:
1. Conducting vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
2. Using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.
3. Spreading further into the target network.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after the initial exploitation.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems. This could be a plausible next step after identifying exploitable web servers, as it allows the attacker to move laterally within the network.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. While this is a common initial access technique, the question already mentions that the initial access has been gained through vulnerability scans and the use of the Explosive Trojan. Therefore, this is less likely to be the next step.

- **C: T1480.001-Environmental Keying**
  - This technique involves ensuring that malware only executes in a specific environment. This is more about ensuring the malware runs correctly and is less about spreading further into the network.

- **D: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves spreading malware through removable media. While this can be a method of lateral movement, it is less common in modern network environments and less likely to be the primary method used by a sophisticated group like Volatile Cedar.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access**: Volatile Cedar conducted vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers and used the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.
2. **Lateral Movement**: After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to spread further into the network.
3. **Technique Evaluation**:
   - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** is the most plausible technique for lateral movement, as it directly involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems within the network.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is less likely because the initial access has already been achieved.
   - **T1480.001-Environmental Keying** is more about ensuring the malware runs correctly, not spreading.
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media** is less common and less likely in a modern network environment.

### Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
