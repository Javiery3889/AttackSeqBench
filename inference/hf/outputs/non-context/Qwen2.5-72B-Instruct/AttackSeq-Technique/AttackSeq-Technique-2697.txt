### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Elfin malware. The key points are:
- Elfin ensured persistence by creating a scheduled task.
- The scheduled task executes a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
- PowerShell commands are used to bypass logging on the infected machine.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - Active scanning involves probing for information or vulnerabilities on a network. This technique is typically used in the reconnaissance phase, not after ensuring persistence.
  - **Not a good fit.**

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. While it is a form of persistence, the question specifically mentions a scheduled task, which is a different technique.
  - **Not the best fit.**

- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating a scheduled task to execute a payload at specific intervals. The question explicitly states that Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
  - **This is a strong fit.**

- **D: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising a software supply chain to deliver malware. This is not related to the persistence mechanism described in the question.
  - **Not a good fit.**

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes Elfin ensuring persistence by creating a scheduled task.
2. The scheduled task executes a malicious VBE file multiple times a day.
3. PowerShell commands are used to bypass logging.
4. Among the answer choices, T1053-Scheduled Task/Job is the most relevant because it directly matches the described technique of creating a scheduled task to execute a payload.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
