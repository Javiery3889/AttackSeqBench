### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the context of the 'Red October' campaign. Specifically, it mentions:
- Communication with C&C servers through the main component set up during the execution phase.
- The need to hide the 'mothership' control server's location.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it is a common technique for executing malicious code, it does not directly address the need to hide the location of the C&C server.

- **B: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the search order for DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one. This is more about subverting the loading of legitimate software and does not directly relate to hiding the C&C server's location.

- **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves using dynamic resolution methods to hide the true location of C&C servers. This can include techniques like domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or using multiple layers of proxy servers to obfuscate the final destination. This aligns well with the need to hide the 'mothership' control server's location.

- **D: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
  - This technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. While it can be used for C&C communication, it does not specifically address the need to hide the location of the C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically mentions the need to hide the 'mothership' control server's location.
  - **T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the need to obfuscate the true location of the C&C server.
  - The other techniques (T1059, T1574.001, and T1071.005) do not directly address the need to hide the C&C server's location.

**Final Answer: C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
