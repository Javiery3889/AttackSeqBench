### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where malware has already collected basic information during the Discovery phase.
- The next phase mentioned is the Collection phase, where the malware is gathering screen recording files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1036.006-Space after Filename**
  - This technique involves adding a space after the filename to hide malicious files. It is more related to Persistence and Defense Evasion, not Collection.

- **Answer Choice D: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
  - This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data. It is more related to the Exfiltration phase, not Collection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifies that the malware is in the Collection phase and is gathering screen recording files.
- Among the given choices, T1113-Screen Capture is the only technique that directly involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is consistent with the Collection phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture**
