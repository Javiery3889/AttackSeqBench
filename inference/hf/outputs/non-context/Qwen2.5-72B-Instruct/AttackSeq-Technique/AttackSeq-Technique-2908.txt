### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated APT15's remote access to the network before deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor. The RoyalDNS backdoor is known for its use of DNS for persistent communication, but the question is specifically about the initial remote access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - This technique involves using local accounts on a system to gain access. While this can be used for initial access, it is less likely for a sophisticated APT group like APT15 to rely solely on local accounts for remote access, especially when they have more advanced methods available.

- **B: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to gain access to a network. This is a common method for initial access and is often used by APT groups to establish a foothold in the network.

- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid accounts (e.g., stolen credentials) to gain access. This is a highly plausible method for APT15, as they are known for using stolen credentials to gain initial access to networks.

- **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves using valid cloud accounts to gain access. While this is a valid method, it is less likely in the context of APT15's known tactics, which typically involve more traditional network access methods.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - APT15 is known for using stolen credentials to gain initial access to networks. This aligns with the T1078-Valid Accounts technique.
  - While external remote services (T1133) are also a common method, the use of valid accounts is more specific and aligns better with the sophisticated nature of APT15's operations.
  - Local accounts (T1078.003) and cloud accounts (T1078.004) are less likely to be the primary method for initial access in this context.

**Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
