### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used coordinated command and control to facilitate ATM withdrawals with physical mules. The final step in this sequence involves the manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains:

- **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. While this could be part of the initial stages of the attack, it is not directly related to the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.

- **B: T1490-Inhibit System Recovery**
  - This technique involves preventing the system from being restored to a previous state, which could be used to cover tracks or prevent detection. However, it does not directly relate to the manipulation of financial systems to enable unauthorized gains.

- **C: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - This technique involves the theft of financial information or funds. This aligns well with the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains, as it directly involves the act of stealing money.

- **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain unauthorized access to systems. While this could be used to gain access to the bank’s internal systems, it is more of a means to an end rather than the final manipulation itself.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks about the final manipulation of the bank’s internal systems to enable unauthorized financial gains.
- **T1657-Financial Theft** directly involves the act of stealing financial information or funds, which is the most plausible technique for the final step in this attack sequence.
- The other techniques (T1072, T1490, and T1558) are more related to initial access, persistence, or covering tracks, but not directly to the final financial manipulation.

**Final Answer: C: T1657-Financial Theft**
