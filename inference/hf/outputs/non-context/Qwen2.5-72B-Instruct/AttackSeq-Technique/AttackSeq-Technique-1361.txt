### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events:
     - Exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute "%Temp%/Rdws.exe".
     - The executed file retrieves a second-stage PlugX file.
     - The PlugX file communicates with C2 domains such as inocnation[.]com.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** CVE-2015-5119 is used to gain initial access.
   - **File Execution:** "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" is saved and executed.
   - **Second-Stage Payload:** A second-stage PlugX file is retrieved.
   - **C2 Communication:** The PlugX file communicates with C2 domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1001.002-Steganography:**
     - Steganography involves hiding data within other files or protocols. This technique is not typically used for C2 communication but rather for data exfiltration or hiding malicious content.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers. This is a common method for C2 communication, especially for malware like PlugX.
   - **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malware to visitors. It is not relevant to the communication phase but rather the initial infection vector.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System:**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is not related to C2 communication but rather to data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial exploit (CVE-2015-5119) and file execution ("%Temp%/Rdws.exe") are part of the initial access and execution phases.
   - The retrieval of the second-stage PlugX file is part of the execution and command and control (C2) phases.
   - The communication with C2 domains (inocnation[.]com) is a critical part of the C2 phase.
   - Among the given options, T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique for C2 communication, as it describes the use of standard protocols to communicate with C2 servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
