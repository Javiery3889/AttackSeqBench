### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack:
1. WinDealer discovers data about the infected PC and network configuration.
2. Data is processed and categorized.
3. Staged data is exfiltrated as ".a" files from the %TEMP% directory to a C2 server.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the data discovery and before the exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. It is typically used to maintain persistence or to bypass network restrictions. It does not directly relate to the processing and categorization of data.

- **B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique involves collecting data from removable media. It is not relevant to the scenario where data is being processed and categorized from the infected PC and network configuration.

- **C: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard. While it could be used to gather sensitive information, it is not directly related to the processing and categorization of data from the infected PC and network configuration.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. After discovering and processing data, an attacker might use this technique to hide the data or the tools used to process it before exfiltration. This aligns well with the scenario described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Discovery and Processing**: WinDealer discovers data about the infected PC and network configuration.
2. **Data Categorization**: The data is processed and categorized.
3. **Hiding Artifacts**: To avoid detection, the attacker might hide the processed data or the tools used to process it.
4. **Exfiltration**: The staged data is exfiltrated as ".a" files from the %TEMP% directory to a C2 server.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that would occur after data discovery and processing is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
