### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The HTTPChannel module enabled continuous communication with the C&C server.
   - After this, screenshots, passwords, and files were encrypted with RC4 and sent in a POST request.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** HTTPChannel module enabled continuous communication with the C&C server.
   - **Final Event:** Screenshots, passwords, and files were encrypted with RC4 and sent in a POST request.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves automated methods to exfiltrate data. However, the question specifies that the data is being encrypted and sent in a POST request, which is more specific than just automated exfiltration.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel. This fits well with the scenario where data is being sent to the C&C server after being encrypted.
   - **C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
     - This technique involves intercepting paths due to unquoted service paths, which is not relevant to the exfiltration process described in the question.
   - **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
     - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which could be a step before exfiltration but is not the most immediate step before the described exfiltration process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The HTTPChannel module establishes a C2 channel.
   - The next logical step is to exfiltrate the data over this established channel.
   - The data (screenshots, passwords, and files) is encrypted and sent in a POST request, which aligns with the technique of exfiltration over the C2 channel.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
