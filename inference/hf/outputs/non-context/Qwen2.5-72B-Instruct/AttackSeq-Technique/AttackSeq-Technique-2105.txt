### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses a backdoor to collect data and establish communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server. The focus is on ensuring that the data transmission with the C&C server is secure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. It is commonly used to secure communications between a compromised system and a C&C server to prevent eavesdropping and data interception.

- **B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves concealing the infrastructure used in an attack, such as using domain fronting or other methods to mask the true location of C&C servers. While this can be used to avoid detection, it does not directly secure the data transmission.

- **C: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a step that occurs before the data is transmitted. It does not address the security of the data transmission itself.

- **D: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
  - This technique involves modifying firmware to maintain persistence on a device. It is not related to securing data transmission.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question specifies that the data transmission with the C&C server needs to be secure.
2. Among the given choices, only T1573-Encrypted Channel directly addresses the security of data in transit.
3. The other techniques (T1665, T1005, and T1542.004) do not focus on securing the data transmission.

**Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
