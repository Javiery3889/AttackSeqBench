### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a threat actor has established persistence by setting a specific registry key to ensure the backdoor execution during user logon. The registry key mentioned is `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load`.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves modifying the system to execute a program when the system boots or a user logs on. The registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load` is a known location for autostart execution, which aligns perfectly with the described scenario.

- **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - This technique involves modifying shared content to spread malware. It does not align with the described scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.

- **C: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying cloud logs to avoid detection. It does not align with the described scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.

- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to avoid detection. It does not align with the described scenario of setting a registry key for persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actor set the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load` registry key to ensure the backdoor execution during user logon.
2. This action is a form of persistence, specifically a logon autostart execution.
3. The ATT&CK technique that best describes this action is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
