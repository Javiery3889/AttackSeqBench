### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: BlackSoul has established communication with a C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **C2 Communication**: Using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
  - **Data Transfer**: The question asks about the technique used to transfer data over the C2 channel.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating and using Kerberos golden tickets to maintain access to a network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not related to data transfer over a C2 channel. It is more about maintaining long-term access and privilege escalation.

- **Answer Choice B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not the primary C2 channel.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant because the question specifies that the data transfer is over the C2 channel, not a non-C2 protocol.

- **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using automated methods to exfiltrate data from a network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is relevant because it involves the automated transfer of data, which could be over the C2 channel.

- **Answer Choice D: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compressing and archiving data before exfiltration.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the transfer of data over the C2 channel. It is more about preparing the data for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifies that BlackSoul has established communication with a C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
  - The focus is on the technique used to transfer data over this C2 channel.
  - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is the most relevant technique because it involves the automated transfer of data, which aligns with the use of a C2 channel for data exfiltration.
  - The other techniques (T1558.001, T1048.001, and T1560) do not directly address the transfer of data over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
