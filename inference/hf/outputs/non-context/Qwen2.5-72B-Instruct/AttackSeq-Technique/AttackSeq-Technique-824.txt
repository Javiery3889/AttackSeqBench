### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat group FIN4:
1. They stole credentials through spearphishing emails.
2. They transmitted the stolen credentials to their C2 (Command and Control) servers.
3. They used a technique to facilitate anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, which is not relevant to the communication with C2 infrastructure. It is more about the initial reconnaissance phase.

- **B: T1590.002-DNS**
  - This technique involves using DNS for communication, which can be used for C2 but is not specifically about anonymous communication. It is more about the method of communication rather than the anonymity aspect.

- **C: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. Proxies can be used to anonymize communication, making it harder to trace the origin of the traffic. This aligns well with the need for anonymous communication with the C2 infrastructure.

- **D: T1205.001-Port Knocking**
  - This technique involves using a sequence of connection attempts to open a port on a target system. It is more about gaining access to a system rather than maintaining anonymous communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Action**: FIN4 steals credentials through spearphishing emails.
2. **Transmission**: The stolen credentials are transmitted to the C2 servers.
3. **Anonymous Communication**: To maintain anonymity while communicating with the C2 infrastructure, a technique that can route traffic through a proxy is most appropriate.

**Reasoning**:
- **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is not relevant to the communication phase.
- **T1590.002-DNS** is a method of communication but does not inherently provide anonymity.
- **T1090-Proxy** is a technique that can be used to route traffic through a proxy, which helps in maintaining anonymity.
- **T1205.001-Port Knocking** is more about gaining access rather than maintaining anonymous communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy**
