### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary:
1. The adversary established C2 (Command and Control) communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike.
2. The adversary then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves maintaining a bidirectional communication channel with the C2 server. While this is related to C2 communication, it is more about the nature of the communication rather than the next step in the sequence.

- **B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials**
  - This technique involves obtaining additional cloud credentials, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data using custom-built malware to cloud storage services.

- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While this could be part of the initial stages of the attack, it does not align with the exfiltration of data using custom-built malware.

- **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C2 communications. While this is related to the HTTPS encapsulation mentioned, it does not describe the exfiltration of data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Establishing C2 Communication**:
   - The adversary used a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike to establish C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation. This aligns with the use of an encrypted channel (T1573).

2. **Exfiltrating Data**:
   - After establishing C2 communication, the adversary exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services. This step involves the actual exfiltration of data, which is not directly covered by any of the given techniques.

3. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication** is about maintaining a communication channel but does not describe the exfiltration.
   - **B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials** is about obtaining credentials, not exfiltration.
   - **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is about executing commands, not exfiltration.
   - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel** is about the C2 communication, not the exfiltration.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 communication would be the exfiltration of data. However, none of the provided choices directly describe data exfiltration. The closest match to the initial C2 communication is **T1573-Encrypted Channel**.

### Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
