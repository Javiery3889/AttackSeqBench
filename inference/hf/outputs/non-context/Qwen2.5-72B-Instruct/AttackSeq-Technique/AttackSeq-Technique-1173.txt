### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where spear-phishing is used to gather authentication credentials. The next step in the sequence is to achieve persistent access by dropping further tooling or obtaining legitimate credentials. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between the initial spear-phishing and the establishment of persistent access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gather information or credentials. However, the question already states that spear-phishing has been used to gather authentication credentials. Therefore, this technique is not the next step in the sequence.

- **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. While this can be a method to gain initial access, it does not align with the sequence described, which involves using credentials obtained through spear-phishing.

- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain or maintain access to systems. Given that the initial step involved gathering authentication credentials through spear-phishing, the next logical step would be to use those credentials to gain access to the target system. This aligns well with the sequence described.

- **D: T1218.009-Regsvcs/Regasm**
  - This technique involves using the `regsvcs` or `regasm` utilities to load and register .NET assemblies, which can be used to execute malicious code. While this can be used to drop further tooling, it is not the immediate next step after obtaining credentials through spear-phishing.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step in the attack sequence is spear-phishing to gather authentication credentials.
2. The next logical step is to use those credentials to gain access to the target system.
3. The technique that best fits this step is T1078-Valid Accounts, as it involves using legitimate credentials to gain or maintain access.

**Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
