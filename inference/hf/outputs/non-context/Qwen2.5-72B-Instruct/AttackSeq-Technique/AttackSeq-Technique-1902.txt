### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where a coin miner is executed on a host, and then a script uses iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the tracking and data collection step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1542.004-ROMMONkit**
  - This technique involves modifying firmware to persist across reboots. It is not directly related to the execution of a coin miner or the tracking of infected hosts.

- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network connections and open ports on the system. This could be relevant if the attacker needed to understand the network environment before executing the coin miner or tracking the infected hosts.

- **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities or open ports on the network. While this could be part of the initial reconnaissance phase, it is not directly related to the execution of the coin miner or the tracking of infected hosts.

- **D: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering account details on the system. This could be relevant if the attacker needed to understand the user accounts and permissions before executing the coin miner or tracking the infected hosts.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution of Coin Miner**: The coin miner is executed on the host, which suggests that the attacker already has some level of access to the system.
2. **Tracking Infected Hosts**: The script uses iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details. This implies that the attacker needs to gather information about the system and its network environment.
3. **Relevant Technique**: Among the given choices, **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** is the most relevant because it involves discovering network connections and open ports, which is necessary for the attacker to understand the network environment and track the infected hosts.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
