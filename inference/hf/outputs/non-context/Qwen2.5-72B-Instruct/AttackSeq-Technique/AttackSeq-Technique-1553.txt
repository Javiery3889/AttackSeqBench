### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42. The sequence includes:
1. Using custom malware to log keystrokes and steal logins for privilege escalation.
2. Conducting internal reconnaissance to browse compromised user contacts and access collaborative spaces like Sharepoint.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the internal reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**
  - This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens or codes. While it can be used for privilege escalation, it is not typically used to log keystrokes or steal logins directly. It is more relevant in scenarios where MFA is in place.

- **B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials (e.g., passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets) from the operating system. It is a common method for privilege escalation and can be used to steal logins. This aligns well with the described sequence of using custom malware to log keystrokes and steal logins.

- **C: T1221-Template Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious code into templates used by applications. It is more relevant to web application attacks and does not align with the described sequence of logging keystrokes and stealing logins.

- **D: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**
  - This sub-technique is a specific method of OS Credential Dumping that targets Unix-like systems. It involves extracting credentials from the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. While it is a form of credential dumping, it is specific to Unix-like systems and may not be the most general technique used in the described scenario.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Custom Malware for Keystroke Logging and Stealing Logins**:
   - This suggests that the attacker is using a method to capture user credentials, which is a form of credential theft.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - After stealing the logins, the attacker uses them to gain higher privileges, which is a common step in the attack chain.

3. **Internal Reconnaissance**:
   - Once the attacker has elevated privileges, they conduct internal reconnaissance to gather more information, such as browsing user contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurred before the internal reconnaissance is **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**. This technique aligns with the use of custom malware to log keystrokes and steal logins, which are then used for privilege escalation.

**Final Answer: B: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
