### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where `libchrome.exe` was used to support credential access by decrypting stored passwords from Local State and Login Data files. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this credential access step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the clipboard. While it can be used to gather sensitive information, it is not typically a next step after decrypting stored passwords. It is more of a separate data collection method.

- **B: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending a spearphishing email with an attachment to gain initial access. This is an initial access technique and would not logically follow the decryption of stored passwords.

- **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**
  - This technique involves compressing and archiving data to exfiltrate it. After decrypting stored passwords, an attacker might want to archive the data to prepare for exfiltration, making this a plausible next step.

- **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. While this can be used for persistence or to run follow-up actions, it is not as directly related to the immediate next step after decrypting stored passwords as archiving the data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Access (libchrome.exe decrypting stored passwords)**: The attacker has already gained access to the credentials.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After obtaining the credentials, the attacker would likely want to exfiltrate the data. Archiving the data (T1560.003) is a common method to prepare for exfiltration.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1115-Clipboard Data** - Not a logical next step.
   - **B: T1598.002-Spearphishing Attachment** - Not a logical next step.
   - **C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method** - Logical next step for exfiltration.
   - **D: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** - Possible but less directly related to immediate exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method
