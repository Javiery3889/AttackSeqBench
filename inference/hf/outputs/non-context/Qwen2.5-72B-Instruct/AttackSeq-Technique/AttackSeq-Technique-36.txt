### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where arbitrary code was executed on an infected host, and then KONNI achieved persistence through a Windows shortcut named `adobe distillist.lnk`.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1070.008-Clear Mailbox Data**
  - This technique involves clearing mailbox data, which is typically used to remove evidence of the attack. It does not directly relate to achieving persistence or executing arbitrary code.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms that allow the attacker's code to execute automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common method for achieving persistence, and creating a Windows shortcut (like `adobe distillist.lnk`) is a specific example of this technique.

- **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is useful for gaining further access but does not directly relate to achieving persistence or executing arbitrary code.

- **D: T1098.004-SSH Authorized Keys**
  - This technique involves adding the attacker's SSH key to the authorized keys file, which is used to maintain access to a system. It is not typically used for achieving persistence on Windows systems and does not align with the creation of a Windows shortcut.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Arbitrary Code Execution**: The attacker has already executed arbitrary code on the infected host.
2. **Persistence Mechanism**: The next step is to achieve persistence, which is done by creating a Windows shortcut named `adobe distillist.lnk`.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that best fits the creation of a Windows shortcut for persistence is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
