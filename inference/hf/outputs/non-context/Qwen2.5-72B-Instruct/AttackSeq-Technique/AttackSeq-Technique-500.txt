### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign. The sequence includes:
1. Defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation.
2. The SombRAT backdoor collecting system information as part of the Discovery phase.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the SombRAT backdoor collected system information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**
  - This technique involves downgrading the security settings or protocols to a less secure version. It is typically used to bypass security mechanisms but is not directly related to the discovery of system information.

- **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. It is a common step in the Discovery phase, where an attacker gathers information about the system to understand its environment and identify potential targets for further actions.

- **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to evade detection. It is more related to network communication and exfiltration rather than the initial discovery of system information.

- **D: T1087.002-Domain Account**
  - This technique involves identifying domain accounts, which is also part of the Discovery phase. However, it is more specific to network and domain information rather than the general system information that the SombRAT backdoor would collect.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion**: The CostaRicto Campaign used techniques like process injection and deobfuscation to evade detection.
2. **Discovery Phase**: The SombRAT backdoor then collected system information.
3. **Preceding Technique**: Before collecting system information, the attacker would need to identify the processes running on the system to understand the environment and plan further actions.

Given the context, the most logical preceding technique is **T1057-Process Discovery**. This technique helps the attacker understand the system's current state and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

### Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
