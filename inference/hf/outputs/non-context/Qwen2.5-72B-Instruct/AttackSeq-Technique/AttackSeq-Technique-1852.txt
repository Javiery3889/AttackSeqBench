### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the VERMIN malware uses WMI queries to gather system information such as the OS name and anti-virus information.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting sensitive information like keystrokes and clipboard data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system, such as IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables. This does not align with collecting keystrokes and clipboard data.
- **T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**: This technique involves collecting data from cloud storage services. This is not relevant to collecting keystrokes and clipboard data.
- **T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about collecting keystrokes and clipboard data.
- **T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, clipboard data, and other forms of input. This aligns perfectly with the described action of collecting sensitive information like keystrokes and clipboard data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The VERMIN malware has already gathered system information using WMI queries.
- The next logical step in the attack sequence is to collect sensitive information like keystrokes and clipboard data.
- Among the given choices, T1056-Input Capture is the technique that directly involves capturing user input, which matches the described action.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
