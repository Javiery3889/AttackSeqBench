### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of the encrypted Korplug malware using a custom loader, followed by collecting metadata and content from mapped drives.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Execution of encrypted malware using a custom loader.
  - Collection of metadata and content from mapped drives.
  - The need to collect system-specific temporal information before the latter step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1087.001 - Local Account**
  - This technique involves identifying local system accounts. While useful for gaining initial access or privilege escalation, it does not directly relate to collecting temporal information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1543 - Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes, which can be used for persistence or to maintain access. It does not directly relate to collecting temporal information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.003 - Bash History**
  - This technique involves accessing the bash history to gather information about commands previously executed by the user. While it can provide useful information, it is not specifically related to collecting temporal information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1124 - System Time Discovery**
  - This technique involves collecting the current system time, which is a form of temporal information. This is directly relevant to the question, as it is a logical step to gather system-specific temporal information before collecting metadata and content from mapped drives.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifies the need to collect system-specific temporal information before collecting metadata and content from mapped drives.
  - Among the given choices, T1124 (System Time Discovery) is the only technique that directly involves collecting temporal information.
  - The other techniques (T1087.001, T1543, and T1552.003) do not align with the specific requirement of collecting temporal information.

**Final Answer: D: T1124 - System Time Discovery**
