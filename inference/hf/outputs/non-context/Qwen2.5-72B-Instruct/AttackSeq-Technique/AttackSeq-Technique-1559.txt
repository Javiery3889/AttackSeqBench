### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT42 to gain initial access. The sequence includes:
1. Engaging targets via spear phishing.
2. Bypassing MFA.
3. Using lightweight tools and custom backdoors for credential harvesting.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before these steps to complement their credential harvesting efforts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**
  - This technique involves installing a root certificate to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it can be useful for intercepting and decrypting traffic, it is not typically a pre-requisite for spear phishing or MFA bypass.

- **B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or acquiring tools, capabilities, or resources to support the attack. This could include creating custom backdoors or lightweight tools, which aligns well with the question's mention of "lightweight tools and custom backdoors."

- **C: T1586.001-Social Media Accounts**
  - This technique involves using social media accounts to gather information or engage with targets. While it can be useful for reconnaissance, it is not directly related to the credential harvesting efforts described.

- **D: T1534-Internal Spearphishing**
  - This technique involves conducting spear phishing within an organization to gain access to internal resources. While it is a form of spear phishing, it is more about internal lateral movement rather than initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access via Spear Phishing**: APT42 uses spear phishing to engage targets.
2. **Bypassing MFA**: They bypass MFA to gain access.
3. **Credential Harvesting**: They use lightweight tools and custom backdoors to harvest credentials.

To complement these efforts, the attackers likely needed to develop or acquire the necessary tools and capabilities. This aligns with the technique **T1587-Develop Capabilities**.

**Final Answer: B: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
