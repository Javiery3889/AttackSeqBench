### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where ProjectM conducted reconnaissance by targeting Indian government and military personnel using spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites such as 'India News Tribe'.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**: 
  - Reconnaissance
  - Spear-phishing emails
  - Watering hole sites

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1543.005-Container Service**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying container services to achieve persistence.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used after gaining initial access to a system and is not directly related to the initial stages of reconnaissance or developing capabilities.

- **Answer Choice B: T1584.008-Network Devices**
  - **Description**: This technique involves targeting network devices to gain access or to move laterally within a network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to the exploitation phase and not to the initial reconnaissance or capability development phase.

- **Answer Choice C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - **Description**: This technique involves developing or enhancing tools, malware, or other capabilities to support the attack.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the question, as it suggests that after conducting reconnaissance and gaining initial access, the attackers would likely develop or enhance their capabilities to further their objectives.

- **Answer Choice D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim, such as usernames, passwords, and other identity-related data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to the reconnaissance phase and is typically used to gather information to support the initial attack, but it does not directly describe the development of capabilities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: ProjectM conducted reconnaissance by targeting Indian government and military personnel.
2. **Initial Access**: They used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to gain initial access.
3. **Next Steps**: After gaining initial access, the logical next step would be to develop or enhance their capabilities to further their attack.

**Final Answer: C: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
