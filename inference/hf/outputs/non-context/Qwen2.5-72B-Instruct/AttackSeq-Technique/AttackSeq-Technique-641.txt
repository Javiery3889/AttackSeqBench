### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers. The key points are:
- The attackers used a 'CPU core check' to evade detection in virtualized environments.
- They achieved persistence through registry modifications tailored to different OS versions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1550.001-Application Access Token**
  - This technique involves using application access tokens to gain access to resources. It is not directly related to evasion or persistence, so it is less likely to be the next step after the described TTPs.

- **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves evading virtualization and sandbox environments. The question already mentions that the attackers used a 'CPU core check' for evasion, so this technique is already part of the sequence and not a subsequent step.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a system. The question does not mention any initial access methods, and the focus is on evasion and persistence, so this is not a likely next step.

- **D: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering network shares to gain further access to the network. After achieving persistence and evading detection, the next logical step for attackers would be to explore the network to find additional targets and resources.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. The attackers used a 'CPU core check' to evade detection in virtualized environments.
2. They achieved persistence through registry modifications tailored to different OS versions.
3. The next logical step after evading detection and achieving persistence would be to explore the network to find additional targets and resources.
4. Among the given choices, T1135-Network Share Discovery is the most plausible next step.

**Final Answer: D: T1135-Network Share Discovery**
