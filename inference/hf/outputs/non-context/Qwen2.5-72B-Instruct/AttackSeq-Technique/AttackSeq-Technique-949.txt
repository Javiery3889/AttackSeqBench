### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Sednit's downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses or domain names to avoid detection. It is often used in the initial stages of an attack to establish a connection to the C&C server. However, it is not specifically about the communication itself but rather the method of resolving the C&C server's address.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the screen of the victim's machine. It is typically used after gaining access to the system to gather information. It does not relate to establishing communication with a C&C server.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the C&C server. It directly relates to the communication method described in the question, where the data is encrypted and hex-encoded.

- **D: T1547.012-Print Processors**
  - This technique involves modifying print processors to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to establishing communication with a C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The question describes a scenario where Sednit's downloaders and backdoors are establishing communication with a C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.
   - The focus is on the communication method, specifically the encryption and encoding of data.

2. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is about resolving the C&C server's address, not the communication itself.
   - **B: T1113-Screen Capture** is about capturing the screen, which is not related to communication with the C&C server.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel** directly addresses the use of encrypted channels for communication, which matches the description in the question.
   - **D: T1547.012-Print Processors** is about modifying print processors, which is not related to communication with the C&C server.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used an encrypted channel (T1573) to establish communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
