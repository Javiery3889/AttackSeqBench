### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence initiated by Patchwork using CVE-2017-8750 through malicious RTF documents.
   - The focus is on the Reconnaissance phase, specifically identifying the technique used to identify targeted recipients who interacted with the spear phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**
     - This technique involves using scripting languages to execute arbitrary code. It is more relevant to the Execution phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
     - This technique involves searching public databases for information. While it can be part of Reconnaissance, it is not specifically about identifying recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information from targets. It is directly related to the Reconnaissance phase and aligns with the goal of identifying recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code. It is more relevant to the Execution phase rather than the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks about the Reconnaissance phase and the technique used to identify targeted recipients who interacted with spear phishing emails.
   - **T1598-Phishing for Information** is the most appropriate choice because it directly involves using phishing to gather information, which is a key part of the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The other choices are either more relevant to different phases of the attack (Execution) or do not specifically address the interaction with spear phishing emails.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
