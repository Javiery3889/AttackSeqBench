### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a trojanized Celas Trade Pro application initiates communication with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers used a legitimate-looking application and valid digital signature to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** The trojanized application initiates communication with the C2 server.
   - **Subsequent Step:** The attackers use a legitimate-looking application and valid digital signature to avoid detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**
     - This technique involves bypassing the macOS Gatekeeper security feature, which is not directly related to the described sequence of events.
   - **B: T1074.001-Local Data Staging**
     - This technique involves collecting and staging data on the victim's system before exfiltration, which is not relevant to the initial communication with the C2 server or the use of a legitimate-looking application.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with the initial step of the trojanized application initiating communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1036-Masquerading**
     - This technique involves making a malicious file or program appear legitimate to avoid detection, which aligns with the subsequent step of using a legitimate-looking application and valid digital signature.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the trojanized application first communicating with the C2 server using HTTP (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) and then using a legitimate-looking application and valid digital signature to avoid detection (T1036-Masquerading).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1036-Masquerading
