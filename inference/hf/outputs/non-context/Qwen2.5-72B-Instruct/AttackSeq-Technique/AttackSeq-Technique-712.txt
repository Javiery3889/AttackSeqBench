### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a malicious XLS document is delivered through a spear phishing email.
   - The focus is on the sequence of TTPs leading up to the execution of the macro code within the document to drop the first payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** The malicious XLS document is delivered via a spear phishing email.
   - **Subsequent Step:** The user opens the document and the macro code within the document is executed to drop the first payload.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1542.001-System Firmware:**
     - This technique involves modifying system firmware to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It is not relevant to the initial delivery and execution of a macro in a document.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to deliver a malicious payload. While it is part of the initial delivery, it does not directly lead to the execution of the macro.
   - **C: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This technique involves the user being tricked into executing a malicious file or script. In this case, the user opens the XLS document and enables the macro, leading to the execution of the payload.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution:**
     - This is the same as choice C and is also relevant to the user opening the document and enabling the macro.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. The malicious XLS document is delivered via a spear phishing email (T1566-Phishing).
     2. The user opens the document and enables the macro, leading to the execution of the payload (T1204-User Execution).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution
