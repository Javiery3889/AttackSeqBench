### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Gallmaker used malicious Office documents exploiting the DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol to gain initial access.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Initial Access**: Malicious Office documents exploiting the DDE protocol.
  - **Execution Phase**: Running commands in memory.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566 - Phishing**
  - **Description**: Phishing involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email, to steal sensitive data or install malware.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is related to the initial access phase but does not specifically address the execution phase of running commands in memory.

- **Answer Choice B: T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or Office application) to execute arbitrary code.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is relevant to the initial access phase where the malicious Office document exploits the DDE protocol. However, it does not specifically address the execution phase of running commands in memory.

- **Answer Choice C: T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands and scripts.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is relevant to the execution phase, as it can be used to run commands in memory. It aligns well with the scenario where commands are executed after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice D: T1574.007 - Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**
  - **Description**: This technique involves manipulating the PATH environment variable to execute malicious code when a user or system process attempts to run a legitimate program.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is more about persistence and does not directly relate to the execution phase of running commands in memory.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a malicious Office document exploiting the DDE protocol, which aligns with T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).
2. **Execution Phase**: After gaining initial access, the next step is to execute commands in memory. The most relevant technique for this phase is T1047 (Windows Management Instrumentation), as it can be used to run commands and scripts in memory.

**Final Answer: C: T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation**
