### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via a hidden object in an Excel document.
   - The next step involves credential access techniques, specifically searching for stored passwords in registry keys.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to evade detection by concealing malicious activities between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1110.003-Password Spraying**
     - This technique involves attempting to log in to many accounts with a few commonly used passwords. It is a credential access technique, not an evasion technique.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common network protocols to communicate with a remote system. While it can be used to evade detection, it is more about communication rather than concealing activities on the local system.
   - **C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
     - This technique involves hiding files or directories to evade detection. It is a specific sub-technique of T1564 (Hide Artifacts) and is directly related to concealing malicious activities.
   - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
     - This is the broader category that includes T1564.005. It involves various methods to hide artifacts, such as files, directories, or processes, to evade detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks for a technique to evade detection by concealing malicious activities.
   - Both C (T1564.005-Hidden File System) and D (T1564-Hide Artifacts) are relevant, but T1564.005 is a more specific sub-technique that directly addresses hiding files or directories.
   - T1564.005 is a more precise match for the context of concealing malicious activities on the local system.

**Final Answer: C: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
