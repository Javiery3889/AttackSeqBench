### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Hi-Zor RAT.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing persistence by creating a copy of itself with a '.dat' extension.
     - Modifying the registry run key using 'regsvr32.exe'.
     - Avoiding detection through string-stacking and double XOR encoding.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute in the context of that process.
     - It is not directly related to avoiding detection through string-stacking and double XOR encoding.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1559-Inter-Process Communication**
     - This technique involves using mechanisms to communicate between processes.
     - It is not directly related to obfuscation or encoding to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to make them more difficult to detect or analyze.
     - String-stacking and double XOR encoding are methods of obfuscation.
     - This choice aligns well with the described technique of avoiding detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
     - This technique involves techniques to bypass network address translation (NAT) to maintain communication with a command and control server.
     - It is not directly related to obfuscation or encoding to avoid detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the use of string-stacking and double XOR encoding to avoid detection.
   - These methods are forms of obfuscation.
   - The ATT&CK technique that best matches this description is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.

**Final Answer: C: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
