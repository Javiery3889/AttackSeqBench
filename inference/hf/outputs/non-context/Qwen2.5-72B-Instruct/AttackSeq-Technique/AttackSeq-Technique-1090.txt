### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Lazarus Group used malicious macros for initial access to a pharmaceutical company's network.
- **Objective**: Determine the next ATT&CK technique that would logically follow to gather information about the network for further exploitation.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection by blending in with normal network activity.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about communication and maintaining access rather than gathering information about the network.

- **Answer Choice B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network topology, to aid in further exploitation.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the objective of equipping themselves with knowledge about the network for further exploitation.

- **Answer Choice C: T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may use a password filter DLL to capture and manipulate user credentials.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more focused on credential harvesting rather than gathering network information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
  - **Description**: Adversaries may search for and use publicly available technical databases to gather information about the victim's network.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique involves gathering information, it is more about using external sources rather than directly exploring the network after gaining initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The Lazarus Group used malicious macros to gain initial access to the network.
2. **Next Step**: After gaining access, the most logical next step would be to gather information about the network to understand its structure and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**: Not directly relevant to gathering network information.
   - **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**: Directly relevant to the objective of understanding the network.
   - **T1556.002-Password Filter DLL**: More focused on credential harvesting.
   - **T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**: Involves external sources, not direct network exploration.

**Final Answer: B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
