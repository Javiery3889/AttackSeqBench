### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an exploit for the CVE-2015-5119 vulnerability in Flash is used to execute a payload.
   - The payload is embedded in an image file ('b.gif') and is executed subsequently.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** The exploit 'show.swf' uses ActionScript to trigger the CVE-2015-5119 vulnerability.
   - **Payload Embedding:** The payload is embedded in the 'b.gif' image.
   - **Subsequent Execution:** The payload is executed after being embedded in the image.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1543.001-Launch Agent:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system startup files or registry keys to automatically execute code when the system is booted or when a user logs in.
     - This does not align with the described sequence of embedding a payload in an image and executing it.

   - **B: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass security mechanisms.
     - While this is related to the initial exploit, it does not specifically address the embedding and execution of the payload in an image.

   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser, email client, or other software) to execute code on the victim's system.
     - This aligns well with the initial exploit using the Flash vulnerability and the subsequent execution of the payload embedded in the image.

   - **D: T1562.001-Disable or Modify Tools:**
     - This technique involves disabling or modifying security tools to prevent detection or analysis.
     - This does not align with the described sequence of embedding a payload in an image and executing it.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the initial exploitation of a client application (Flash) to execute code, followed by the embedding and subsequent execution of the payload in an image.
- The technique that best fits this sequence is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution
