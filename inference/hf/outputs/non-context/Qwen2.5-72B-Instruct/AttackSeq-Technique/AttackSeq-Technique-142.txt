### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an initial exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious HWP files. It then asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to simplify malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1114-Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's email client or server. It is not related to simplifying malicious code or evasion.

- **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves manipulating the system's path environment to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to simplifying malicious code or evasion.

- **C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness**
  - This technique involves exploiting weak permissions in the Windows Services registry to modify or create services. It is not directly related to simplifying malicious code or evasion.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to evade detection. Simplifying malicious EPS file code to better evade detection aligns with this technique, as it involves making the code less detectable by security systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Exploitation**: The attack starts with exploiting a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious HWP files.
2. **Simplification for Evasion**: The next step is to simplify the malicious EPS file code to better evade detection.
3. **Evasion Techniques**: Among the given choices, T1070-Indicator Removal is the most relevant technique for simplifying and obfuscating malicious code to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
