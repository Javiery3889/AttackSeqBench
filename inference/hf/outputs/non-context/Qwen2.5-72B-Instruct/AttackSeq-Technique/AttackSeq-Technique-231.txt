### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has deployed backdoors as services and obfuscated their presence using encrypted configuration files.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish secure communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
     - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and resilience. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically focus on encryption.
   - **B: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation**
     - This technique involves manipulating the Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) database to gain access to protected resources. It is not related to establishing secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality of data in transit, which is directly related to establishing secure communication with C2 servers.
   - **D: T1055-Process Injection**
     - This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process to execute arbitrary code. It is not related to establishing secure communication with C2 servers.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the deployment of backdoors and the use of encrypted configuration files to obfuscate their presence.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence is to establish secure communication with C2 servers.
   - Among the given choices, **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the need to protect the communication between the compromised system and the C2 server using encryption.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
