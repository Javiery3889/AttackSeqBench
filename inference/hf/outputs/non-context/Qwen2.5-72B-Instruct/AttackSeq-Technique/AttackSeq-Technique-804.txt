### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Higaisa group first employs defense evasion by renaming `certutil.exe` to `gosia.exe`.
- After this, the group executes commands via `cmd /c ipconfig` for discovery purposes.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1124 - System Time Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary querying the system for the current date and time. While this can be useful for various purposes, it is not directly related to network configuration discovery.
- **T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system's network configuration, which is exactly what `ipconfig` is used for. This aligns well with the described action of executing `cmd /c ipconfig`.
- **T1556.005 - Reversible Encryption**: This technique involves modifying authentication mechanisms to use reversible encryption, which is not related to network configuration discovery.
- **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the adversary using command-line interfaces or scripting interpreters to execute commands. While this is a broader category that includes the use of `cmd`, it does not specifically address the discovery of network configuration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion**: The group renames `certutil.exe` to `gosia.exe` to avoid detection.
2. **Command Execution**: The group then uses `cmd /c ipconfig` to gather information about the system's network configuration.
3. **Relevance of TTPs**:
   - **T1124** is not directly related to network configuration.
   - **T1016** is directly related to network configuration discovery, which matches the use of `ipconfig`.
   - **T1556.005** is not related to network configuration.
   - **T1059** is a broader category that includes command execution but does not specifically address network configuration discovery.

### Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
