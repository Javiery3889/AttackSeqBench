### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where APT10 conducted internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and later stages using open-source pentesting tools to map out the network.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Internal reconnaissance
  - Use of common Windows tools
  - Use of open-source pentesting tools
  - Mapping out the network

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials or other methods to authenticate to systems. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to network mapping or reconnaissance.
- **Answer Choice B: T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering Wi-Fi networks, which is not relevant to the internal network mapping described in the question.
- **Answer Choice C: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying remote systems on a network, which aligns well with the described activity of mapping out the network using reconnaissance tools.
- **Answer Choice D: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - This technique involves manipulating or bypassing multi-factor authentication, which is not directly related to network mapping or reconnaissance.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes APT10 conducting internal reconnaissance and mapping out the network.
  - The use of common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools suggests that the attackers are gathering information about the network topology and identifying remote systems.
  - Among the given choices, T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most relevant technique as it directly involves identifying remote systems on the network, which is a key part of network mapping and reconnaissance.
- **Final Answer**: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery
