### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where lightSpy:
1. Established execution to install a modular backdoor for remote command capabilities.
2. Maintained evasion by exploiting a Safari bug.
3. Used a signed Apple developer certificate.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While this could be part of the initial execution, it does not directly address the evasion techniques mentioned (exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate).

- **B: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**
  - This technique involves manipulating DHCP responses to redirect network traffic. This is not relevant to the described evasion techniques (exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate).

- **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as code signing, to gain execution and persistence. Using a signed Apple developer certificate to evade detection aligns well with this technique. Additionally, exploiting a Safari bug to maintain evasion can be seen as subverting the browser's trust controls.

- **D: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique involves reducing the key space in cryptographic attacks, which is not relevant to the described evasion techniques (exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate).

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: lightSpy established execution to install a modular backdoor for remote command capabilities.
2. **Evasion Techniques**:
   - **Exploiting a Safari Bug**: This involves subverting the browser's trust controls to maintain evasion.
   - **Using a Signed Apple Developer Certificate**: This involves subverting the code signing trust controls to gain execution and persistence.

Given the described evasion techniques, the most plausible answer is **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
