### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - The focus is on the technique that likely follows the use of these proxy tools to establish communication with malicious external websites.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Leveraging Proxy Tools (Ngrok):** This is used for tunneling traffic, often to bypass network restrictions or to establish a secure connection to a remote server.
   - **Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration:** These actions involve moving within the network and stealing data.
   - **Establish Communication with Malicious External Websites:** This suggests that the attacker is setting up a persistent communication channel with external servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1205-Traffic Signaling:** This technique involves using legitimate services to signal or communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While it can be used for communication, it is not the most direct fit for the scenario described.
   - **B: T1571-Non-Standard Port:** This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it can be used to evade detection, it is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure. This aligns well with the scenario of establishing communication with malicious external websites.
   - **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:** This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While it is a common technique, it is not the most relevant for establishing communication with external websites.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Proxy Tools (Ngrok):** These tools are used to create a tunnel to a remote server, often for bypassing network restrictions.
2. **Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration:** These actions are performed within the network to move laterally and steal data.
3. **Establish Communication with Malicious External Websites:** The next logical step is to set up a persistent communication channel with external servers to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that follows the use of proxy tools to establish communication with external websites is **T1102-Web Service**. This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure, which aligns well with the described scenario.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
