### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the obfuscated VBS script executed using 'wscript.exe' yet ensured detection was evaded by deleting itself post-execution?
- **Key Points**:
  - The VBS script was executed using `wscript.exe`.
  - The script deleted itself after execution to evade detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with malicious content. It does not directly relate to the self-deletion of a script.
  - **B: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**: This technique involves using hybrid identity to gain access to cloud resources. It is not relevant to the self-deletion of a script.
  - **C: T1547.007-Re-opened Applications**: This technique involves re-opening applications to maintain persistence. It does not relate to the self-deletion of a script.
  - **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. This could include deleting files or logs to avoid leaving traces of the attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The VBS script was executed using `wscript.exe`, which is a common method for running scripts.
  - After execution, the script deleted itself to avoid detection. This is a common tactic to hide artifacts and evade detection.
  - The technique that best fits this behavior is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique includes various methods to hide the presence of malicious activities, such as deleting files or logs.
  - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the self-deletion of a script to evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
