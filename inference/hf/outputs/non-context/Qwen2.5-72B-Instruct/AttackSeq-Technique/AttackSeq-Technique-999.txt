### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events leading to the deployment of RYUK ransomware.
   - Key points:
     - Command-and-Control (C2) communications with `170.130.55[.]85:443` and `hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate`.
     - RYUK ransomware deployment.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     - Establishing C2 communications.
     - Deploying RYUK ransomware.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it could be relevant to the C2 communication, it doesn't directly precede the deployment of RYUK ransomware.
   - **B: T1593.003-Code Repositories**
     - This technique involves using code repositories to host malicious code. It is not typically a step that occurs immediately before deploying ransomware.
   - **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. While it could be part of the attack, it is not a necessary step before deploying RYUK ransomware.
   - **D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using webhooks. Similar to T1048, it is not a necessary step before deploying RYUK ransomware.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible sequence involves establishing C2 communications before deploying RYUK ransomware. The C2 communication is crucial for the attacker to control the compromised system and deploy the ransomware.
   - Among the given choices, **T1571-Non-Standard Port** is the most relevant to the C2 communication step.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port
