### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where KiraV2, a malware, periodically receives commands from a C&C (Command and Control) server to execute DDoS attacks. It mentions that KiraV2 uses hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers for communication with the C&C server.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Periodic command reception from C&C server.
  - Use of hard-coded IP addresses.
  - Use of encoded port numbers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate to services or systems.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server or the encoding of data. It is more related to lateral movement and authentication within a network.

- **Answer Choice B: T1102.003-One-Way Communication**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using one-way communication channels to send data from the compromised system to the C&C server without expecting a response.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be a method of communication, the question specifically mentions periodic command reception, which implies two-way communication. Therefore, this is not the most likely technique.

- **Answer Choice C: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable during exfiltration or communication with a C&C server.
  - **Relevance**: The question mentions the use of encoded port numbers, which aligns with the concept of data encoding. This technique is highly relevant to the scenario described.

- **Answer Choice D: T1499-Endpoint Denial of Service**
  - **Description**: This technique involves causing a denial of service on an endpoint, which is a result of the DDoS attacks mentioned in the question.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is related to the DDoS attacks, it does not describe the communication method with the C&C server. It is a result of the commands received, not a prerequisite for the communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a scenario where KiraV2 uses hard-coded IP addresses and encoded port numbers to communicate with the C&C server.
  - The use of encoded port numbers is a clear indication of data encoding, which is a technique used to obfuscate communication and make it less detectable.
  - Among the given choices, T1132-Data Encoding is the most relevant and aligns best with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: C: T1132-Data Encoding**
