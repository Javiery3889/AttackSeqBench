### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the Welcome Chat app targeting Arabic-speaking Android users through a dedicated website. The sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. The app targets users through a dedicated website.
2. The app ensures its functionality is activated every time the device starts.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two events.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1614 - System Location Discovery**
  - This technique involves the adversary determining the physical or logical location of the system. It is not directly related to the initial targeting of users through a website or ensuring the app's functionality is activated at startup.

- **B: T1593.001 - Social Media**
  - This technique involves the adversary using social media to gather information or spread malware. While it could be used to target users, it does not fit the context of a dedicated website and ensuring app functionality at startup.

- **C: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves the adversary exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. This could be a plausible step after targeting users through a dedicated website, as the website itself could be used to deliver a malicious payload that exploits a vulnerability in the user's browser or the app.

- **D: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This is the same as option C, so it is also a plausible step.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The app targets Arabic-speaking Android users through a dedicated website.
2. The app exploits a vulnerability in the user's browser or the app itself to gain initial access (T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application).
3. The app ensures its functionality is activated every time the device starts.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred between targeting users through a dedicated website and ensuring the app's functionality is activated at startup is **T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**.

### Final Answer: C: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application
