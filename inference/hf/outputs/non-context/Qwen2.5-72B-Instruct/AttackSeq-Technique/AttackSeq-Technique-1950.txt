### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The attacker used spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachments to implant the PlugX RAT.
- **Persistence**: The attacker achieved persistence using Service + Run Key.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. While this could be part of the attack, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately before achieving persistence.
- **T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data in a non-standard way to evade detection. This is more related to data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication, not directly related to achieving persistence.
- **T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**: This technique involves using container orchestration jobs to execute malicious code. This is more relevant to cloud environments and is not typically used in the context of achieving persistence on a Windows system.
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute malicious code at system boot or user logon. This is directly related to achieving persistence, and the specific methods mentioned (Service + Run Key) are sub-techniques of T1547.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains initial access through spear-phishing emails with exploit-laden Microsoft Word attachments.
2. **Implantation**: The PlugX RAT is implanted on the victim's system.
3. **Persistence**: To ensure the RAT remains on the system, the attacker sets up persistence mechanisms. The most likely technique for this is T1547, which includes sub-techniques like Service and Run Key.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
