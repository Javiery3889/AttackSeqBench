### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious Excel file prompts the victim to enable macros, which then executes a payload using `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware established mechanisms to hide from debuggers such as Ollydbg and IDA.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick victims into opening attachments or clicking on links. While this could be the initial vector for delivering the malicious Excel file, it is not the next step in the sequence after the macro execution.
- **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller**: This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials. This is not relevant to the sequence described, which focuses on macro execution and debugger evasion.
- **T1622-Debugger Evasion**: This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers. The question specifically mentions that the malware establishes mechanisms to hide from debuggers, so this is a plausible next step.
- **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves identifying the system's owner or user. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of macro execution and debugger evasion.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step is the victim being prompted to enable macros in a malicious Excel file.
2. The macros then execute a payload using `ShellExecute` under `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
3. The next logical step in the sequence is for the malware to establish mechanisms to hide from debuggers such as Ollydbg and IDA, which is described by T1622-Debugger Evasion.
4. The other techniques (T1566, T1207, and T1033) do not fit as well into the sequence described.

**Final Answer: C: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
