### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT28:
1. Ensured persistence.
2. Altered the timestamps of files downloaded by the second stage dropper to conceal them from victims.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. While this is a common technique used by APTs, it does not directly relate to altering file timestamps or concealing files.

- **B: T1218.013-Mavinject**
  - This technique involves using the `mavinject` utility to inject code into processes. This is a method for maintaining persistence and executing code, but it does not involve altering file timestamps or concealing files.

- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to avoid detection. Altering file timestamps to conceal files is a specific form of indicator removal. This aligns well with the described action of altering timestamps to hide files.

- **D: T1546.017-Udev Rules**
  - This technique involves using Udev rules to maintain persistence by automatically running malicious code when certain devices are connected. While this is a method for persistence, it does not involve altering file timestamps or concealing files.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: APT28 ensured persistence, which could involve various techniques like T1546 (Event Triggered Execution) or T1218 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution).
2. **Timestamp Alteration**: After ensuring persistence, APT28 altered the timestamps of files to conceal them from victims. This is a form of indicator removal.
3. **Indicator Removal**: The technique T1070 (Indicator Removal) specifically includes actions like altering file timestamps to hide malicious activity.

Given the sequence of actions described, the most plausible technique that occurred after ensuring persistence and altering file timestamps is T1070 (Indicator Removal).

**Final Answer: C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
