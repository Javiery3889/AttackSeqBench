### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers:
1. Used scanning tools.
2. Stole credentials for discovery.
3. Achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the lateral movement using RDP.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting emails from a remote system. While it could be part of an attack, it is not typically a prerequisite for lateral movement using RDP.

- **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. It is often used to automate tasks and can be a step in the attack sequence, but it is not specifically tied to the use of RDP for lateral movement.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using various remote services to access and control systems. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a specific sub-technique under T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol). Therefore, T1021 is a broader category that includes RDP.

- **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This sub-technique involves using cloud services for remote access. While it is a valid method for lateral movement, it is not the specific technique used in this scenario, which involves RDP.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers used scanning tools and stole credentials for discovery.
2. They then achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers.
3. The technique that most likely occurred before the lateral movement using RDP is a broader category that includes RDP, which is T1021 (Remote Services).

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
