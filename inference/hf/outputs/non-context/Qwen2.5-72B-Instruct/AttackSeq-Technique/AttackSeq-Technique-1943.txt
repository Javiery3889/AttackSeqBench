### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Smooth Operator malware collects system details, including the OS version, hostname, and account-related data.
   - Specifically, it mentions that the malware extracts domain and account name values from the `config.json` file of 3CX during the collection process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This technique involves adversaries degrading or disabling security tools and services to avoid detection. It does not align with the collection of data from a configuration file.
   - **B: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
     - This technique involves using multiple proxies to obfuscate the origin of network traffic. It is not related to the collection of data from a configuration file.
   - **C: T1114.002-Remote Email Collection**
     - This technique involves collecting email data from remote email accounts. It is not relevant to the collection of data from a configuration file.
   - **D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
     - This technique involves collecting data from configuration repositories, which can include configuration files. This aligns well with the scenario where the malware extracts domain and account name values from the `config.json` file.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware is collecting system details and specifically extracting domain and account name values from the `config.json` file of 3CX.
   - The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this action is T1602, which involves collecting data from configuration repositories.
   - The other techniques (T1562, T1090.003, and T1114.002) do not align with the described collection process.

**Final Answer: D: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
