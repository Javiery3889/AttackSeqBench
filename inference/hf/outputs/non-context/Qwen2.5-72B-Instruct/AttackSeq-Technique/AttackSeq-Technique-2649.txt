### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where Dridex malware achieves initial access by using spambots to deliver malicious documents with embedded macros. These macros then download the malware payload. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves adversaries using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While this can be part of the attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after initial access via a macro.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves adversaries obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This is a common technique used to hide the presence of malware, but it is not necessarily the immediate next step after initial access.

- **C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate software deployment tools to execute their payloads. This is a plausible next step after initial access, as the malware might use such tools to deploy additional components or spread further.

- **D: T1027.012-LNK Icon Smuggling**
  - This technique involves adversaries using LNK files to smuggle icons and execute malicious code. While this can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after initial access via a macro.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Dridex achieves initial access by using spambots to deliver malicious documents with embedded macros.
2. **Macro Execution**: The macros in the documents download the malware payload.
3. **Next Step**: After the malware payload is downloaded, the next logical step is to deploy and execute additional components or spread further within the network.

Given the options, the most plausible next step is the use of **Software Deployment Tools (T1072)** to deploy additional components of the malware or to spread further within the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
