### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CEIDPageLock rootkit:
1. The rootkit gathers browsing data on victims to monitor websites visited and time spent.
2. The rootkit needs to establish communication with its hard-coded C&C (Command and Control) domains.
3. The rootkit downloads the homepage configuration from the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
  - This technique involves the use of customer relationship management (CRM) software to gather information. It is not relevant to the rootkit establishing communication with a C&C server.

- **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves manipulating network traffic to blend in with normal traffic or to avoid detection. While it could be used to obfuscate communication, it is not the primary method for establishing communication with a C&C server.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C&C server. This is a common method for establishing communication and downloading configurations or commands.

- **D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a victim's system through a web browser when they visit a malicious website. It is not relevant to the rootkit establishing communication with a C&C server after it has already gathered data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The rootkit has already gathered browsing data.
2. It needs to establish communication with a C&C server.
3. The most logical method for this communication is using a standard application layer protocol (T1071).

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
