### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has discovered MSSQL Server processes using the Inner-Loader component. The next step in the attack sequence involves bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1548.001-Setuid and Setgid**
  - This technique involves setting the setuid and setgid bits on files to change the user or group ID of a process. This is more relevant to Unix-like systems and is not typically used to bypass authentication in MSSQL Server processes.

- **B: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs to execute malicious code. While this can be used to maintain persistence, it is not specifically about bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms.

- **C: T1556-Modify Authentication Process**
  - This technique involves modifying the authentication process to allow the attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms. This is highly relevant to the scenario where the attacker needs to bypass authentication for MSSQL Server processes.

- **D: T1127.001-MSBuild**
  - This technique involves using MSBuild to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically about bypassing authentication or maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Context**: The attacker has discovered MSSQL Server processes and needs to bypass authentication and maintain stealth.
2. **Evaluate Techniques**:
   - **Setuid and Setgid**: Not relevant to MSSQL Server authentication.
   - **Hijack Execution Flow**: Not specifically about authentication or logging.
   - **Modify Authentication Process**: Directly relevant to bypassing authentication.
   - **MSBuild**: Not specifically about authentication or logging.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for bypassing authentication and maintaining stealth against logging mechanisms in the context of MSSQL Server processes is **T1556-Modify Authentication Process**.

Final Answer: C: T1556-Modify Authentication Process
