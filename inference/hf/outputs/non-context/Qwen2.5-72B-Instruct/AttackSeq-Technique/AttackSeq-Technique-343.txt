### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution as a Command and Control (C2) technique during the SolarWinds Orion platform compromise.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves using various methods to hide the infrastructure used for C2. While it is relevant to C2, it is more about concealing the infrastructure rather than facilitating the initial communication.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with C2 servers. This is a common method for establishing and maintaining communication with compromised systems, making it a strong candidate.

- **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization. While this is a critical part of the SolarWinds compromise, it is more about the initial infection vector rather than the communication method used after the compromise.

- **D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature**
  - This sub-technique involves using invalid code signatures to bypass security checks. It is more about evading detection rather than facilitating communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The SolarWinds compromise began with a supply chain attack (T1195), where the attackers injected malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software updates.
2. **Establishing Communication**: Once the malicious code was installed on the target systems, the attackers needed a way to communicate with these compromised systems. This is where the use of standard application layer protocols (T1071) comes into play.
3. **Dynamic Resolution**: After establishing initial communication, the attackers could then use dynamic resolution as a more sophisticated C2 technique.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that facilitated communication with compromised systems before using dynamic resolution is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
