### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass AppLocker for defense evasion. After this, the backdoor collects the machine's IP address information by querying external services as part of its registration process with the C&C server.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Obfuscated PowerShell Scripts**: Used for defense evasion.
  - **Collecting Machine IP Address Information**: Part of the backdoor's registration process with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and IP address.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because collecting the machine's IP address is a form of system information discovery.

- **Answer Choice B: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary identifying the system's owner or user.
  - **Relevance**: This is less relevant because the question specifically mentions collecting IP address information, not user or owner information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.003-Bash History**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary accessing the Bash history to gather information.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant because the question does not mention any use of Bash or shell history.

- **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary using obfuscation to hide the nature of the files or information.
  - **Relevance**: This is relevant to the initial part of the attack (bypassing AppLocker), but not to the step of collecting IP address information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Step**: The attacker uses obfuscated PowerShell scripts to bypass AppLocker for defense evasion (T1027).
2. **Subsequent Step**: The backdoor collects the machine's IP address information by querying external services as part of its registration process with the C&C server.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The collection of IP address information is a form of system information discovery (T1082).

**Final Answer: A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
