### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs performed by the DRAGONFISH threat group. The sequence includes:
1. System information collection
2. Retrieval of installed software
3. Retrieval of proxy details

These activities are part of the reconnaissance phase of the attack. The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the next logical step in the attack sequence:

- **A: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves adversaries using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While this can be part of various stages of an attack, it is not typically the next step after reconnaissance. It is more likely to be used for execution or persistence.

- **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves adversaries gathering information about running processes on a system. This is a logical next step after collecting system information and software details, as it helps the adversary understand the current state of the system and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

- **C: T1069.002-Domain Groups**
  - This technique involves adversaries enumerating domain groups to identify users and permissions. While this can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more specific to domain environments and might not be the immediate next step after collecting system and software information.

- **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves adversaries using non-standard ports for communication. This is more relevant to the command and control (C2) phase of the attack, which typically occurs after the reconnaissance and initial foothold stages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: DRAGONFISH has already performed system information collection, retrieved installed software, and proxy details.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to gather more detailed information about the system, such as running processes, to understand the system's current state and identify potential targets.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **T1106-Native API**: Not the immediate next step.
   - **T1057-Process Discovery**: Logical next step for further reconnaissance.
   - **T1069.002-Domain Groups**: More specific to domain environments.
   - **T1571-Non-Standard Port**: More relevant to C2 phase.

### Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
