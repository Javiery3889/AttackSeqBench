### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is achieved through aviation-related spear-phishing emails.
   - The malware used is Elirks, which establishes contact with a C2 server by accessing pre-determined encoded addresses on microblog or social networking services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails (T1566.002)
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Elirks malware uses microblog or social networking services to communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1556.001-Domain Controller Authentication**
     - This technique involves modifying domain controller authentication to maintain access. It is not directly related to the initial access or C2 communication described in the question.
   - **B: T1087.003-Email Account**
     - This technique involves gathering information from email accounts. While it could be used post-compromise, it does not align with the C2 communication described.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves using web services for C2 communication. Given that Elirks uses microblog or social networking services, which are web-based, this is a strong candidate.
   - **D: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
     - This technique involves using algorithms to generate domain names for C2 communication. While it is a method for C2, the question specifically mentions pre-determined encoded addresses, not dynamically generated ones.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails (T1566.002)
     2. Command and Control: Using web services (T1102) to communicate with the C2 server via microblog or social networking services.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
