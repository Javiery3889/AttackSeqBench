### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy group.
- The focus is on the technique used to harvest credentials by targeting access to Kavach, an MFA app.
- The sequence of TTPs includes modular plugins for keylogging and file enumeration, but the question is specifically about the technique used before these plugins were utilized.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up programs to automatically execute at boot or logon. While this can be used to maintain persistence, it is not directly related to harvesting credentials or targeting an MFA app.

- **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which is a common method for harvesting credentials. This aligns well with the goal of targeting an MFA app to capture credentials.

- **Answer Choice C: T1213.001-Confluence**
  - This technique is related to exploiting web application vulnerabilities, specifically in Atlassian Confluence. It is not relevant to the context of harvesting credentials from an MFA app.

- **Answer Choice D: T1115-Clipboard Data**
  - This technique involves capturing data from the clipboard, which can be used to steal sensitive information. However, it is not as directly related to capturing credentials from an MFA app as input capture.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The goal of the SideCopy group was to harvest credentials by targeting access to Kavach, an MFA app.
  - Capturing user input, such as keystrokes, is a common and effective method for harvesting credentials.
  - T1056-Input Capture is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it directly involves capturing user input, which can include credentials entered into the MFA app.

- **Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
