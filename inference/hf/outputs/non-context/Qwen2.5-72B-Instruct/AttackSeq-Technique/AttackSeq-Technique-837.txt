### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where WinDealer processes and encrypts data before exfiltration and maintains communication with a C2 server using specific ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556).
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Data processing and encryption before exfiltration.
  - Communication with a C2 server using non-standard ports.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using a non-standard port for communication, which is often used to avoid detection by network security systems.
  - **Relevance**: The question mentions communication using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556, which are non-standard ports. This aligns well with the technique.

- **Answer Choice B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality of data in transit.
  - **Relevance**: The question mentions that the data is encrypted before exfiltration, which aligns with this technique. However, the question specifically asks about maintaining communication with the C2 server using specific ports, which is more directly related to T1571.

- **Answer Choice C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering software installed on a system, which is not relevant to the communication or exfiltration process described in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using digital certificates for various purposes, such as establishing secure connections. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the use of digital certificates is not specifically indicated.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the use of non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) for communication with the C2 server.
  - While encryption is mentioned, the primary focus of the question is on the communication method using these specific ports.
  - T1571-Non-Standard Port directly addresses the use of non-standard ports for communication, which is the most relevant technique in this context.

**Final Answer: A: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
