### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Before attackers gained Initial Access via phishing emails, which ATT&CK technique most likely involved targeting specific details about potential victims during the Reconnaissance phase?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1137.001-Office Template Macros
  - B: T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning
  - C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information
  - D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1137.001-Office Template Macros**: This technique involves using macros in Office templates to execute malicious code. This is typically used during the Execution phase, not the Reconnaissance phase.
- **T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning**: This technique involves scanning for valid credentials using wordlists. While this can be part of the Reconnaissance phase, it is more focused on credential gathering rather than gathering specific details about potential victims.
- **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about potential victims, such as names, job titles, and contact information. This is a key part of the Reconnaissance phase and is often used to tailor phishing emails to specific individuals.
- **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is typically used during the Exfiltration phase, not the Reconnaissance phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question asks about the Reconnaissance phase, which is the initial stage where attackers gather information about potential victims.
  - **T1137.001-Office Template Macros** and **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel** are not relevant to the Reconnaissance phase.
  - **T1595.003-Wordlist Scanning** is more about credential gathering, which is not the primary focus of the question.
  - **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the most relevant technique, as it involves collecting specific details about potential victims, which is crucial for tailoring phishing emails.

**Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
