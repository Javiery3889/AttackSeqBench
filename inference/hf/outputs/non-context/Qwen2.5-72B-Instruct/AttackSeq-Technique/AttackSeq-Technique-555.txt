### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries stripped the SNOWYAMBER binary to evade detection, but inadvertently revealed exported function details.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely preceded the defense evasion activity during the initial delivery of malicious payloads like SNOWYAMBER ZIP and ISO files hosted on various domains.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and deliver malicious content. While it could be used for initial delivery, it is more about using web services for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration.
- **T1078.003-Local Accounts**: This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to systems. It is typically used after initial access has been gained, not for the initial delivery of payloads.
- **T1558.003-Kerberoasting**: This technique involves requesting and cracking Kerberos service tickets to gain access to service accounts. It is used for credential access and is not related to the initial delivery of payloads.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves tricking users into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links, which can lead to the initial delivery of payloads. This is a common method for delivering ZIP and ISO files containing malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Delivery**: The question specifies that the adversaries delivered malicious payloads like SNOWYAMBER ZIP and ISO files hosted on various domains. This suggests that the initial delivery method involved tricking users into downloading or opening these files.
2. **Phishing (T1566)**: Phishing is a common method for delivering malicious payloads. It involves sending emails or creating web pages that trick users into downloading or opening malicious files.
3. **Defense Evasion**: After the initial delivery, the adversaries stripped the SNOWYAMBER binary to evade detection. This is a common follow-up step after gaining initial access to the system.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversaries used phishing to deliver the malicious payloads, which was then followed by defense evasion techniques.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
