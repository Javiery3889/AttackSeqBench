### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services (specifically Pastebin or Google+) to evade detection and communicate with C2 servers. We need to identify the ATT&CK technique that best fits this behavior.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
  - This technique involves adversaries obtaining credentials from files on a system. It does not relate to communication with C2 servers or the use of third-party services.

- **B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves adversaries obfuscating files or information to evade detection. While it can be used to hide the presence of malware, it does not specifically address the communication with C2 servers through third-party services.

- **C: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other files or data streams. While it can be used to evade detection, it is not typically used for communication with C2 servers through third-party services.

- **D: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 servers. This aligns well with the scenario where Scote malware uses Pastebin or Google+ to communicate with C2 servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Key Behavior**: The malware uses legitimate third-party online services (Pastebin or Google+) to communicate with C2 servers.
2. **Evaluate Each Technique**:
   - **T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: Not relevant to communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: Not specific to communication with C2 servers.
   - **T1001.002-Steganography**: Not typically used for C2 communication.
   - **T1102-Web Service**: Directly relevant to using legitimate web services for C2 communication.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique that fits the described behavior is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
