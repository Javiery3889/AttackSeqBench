### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where SkinnyBoy collects system information (using `systeminfo` and `tasklist` commands) and targeted directory contents.
   - The next step in the sequence is the communication with a C2 server (`updaterweb[.]com`) to exfiltrate the collected data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Data Collection:** `systeminfo` and `tasklist` commands are used to gather system information.
   - **Data Collection:** Targeted directory contents are collected.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The collected data is sent to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1546.011-Application Shimming:**
     - This technique involves modifying the behavior of legitimate applications by using shims. It is not directly related to data exfiltration or the collection of system information.
   - **B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which aligns perfectly with the described sequence where data is sent to the C2 server.
   - **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts:**
     - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it could be used in conjunction with other techniques, it does not directly describe the exfiltration of data.
   - **D: T1011.001-Exfiltration Over Bluetooth:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over Bluetooth, which is not mentioned in the question. The question specifically states that the data is exfiltrated over a C2 server.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after collecting the system information and directory contents, the malware exfiltrates the data over the C2 channel.
- The technique that best describes this step is **T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel
