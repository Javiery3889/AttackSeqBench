### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TeamTNT. The sequence includes:
1. Leveraging exposed Weave Scope services for initial access.
2. Executing a coin miner saved as `/usr/sbin/docker-update`.
3. Scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
4. Employing iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering containers and resources within a network. Scanning for open Docker API endpoints fits well with this technique, as it is a way to discover and potentially exploit Docker resources.

- **B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**
  - This technique involves impairing command history logging to hide the attacker's actions. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.

- **C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. While the execution of the coin miner could involve this technique, it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.

- **D: T1007-System Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system services. While this could be relevant, it is not as specific to the described sequence as scanning for Docker API endpoints.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access**: TeamTNT leverages exposed Weave Scope services to gain initial access.
2. **Execution of Coin Miner**: They execute a coin miner saved as `/usr/sbin/docker-update`.
3. **Scanning for Docker API Endpoints**: They scan for open Docker API endpoints, which is a form of container and resource discovery.
4. **Tracking Infected Hosts**: They use iplogger.org to track infected hosts.

The most relevant technique in this sequence is the scanning for open Docker API endpoints, which aligns with **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**.

### Final Answer: A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery
