### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the malware "ChChes" uses a code signing certificate to evade detection. After this, the malware communicates with its C&C (Command and Control) servers to receive commands and modules.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Code Signing Certificate**: Used to evade detection.
  - **C&C Communication**: The malware communicates with its C&C servers to receive commands and modules.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1659 - Content Injection**
  - **Description**: Content Injection involves inserting malicious content into legitimate traffic or files.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to C&C communication or evading detection through code signing.

- **Answer Choice B: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: Encrypted Channel involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of C&C communications.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the scenario. After evading detection, the malware would likely use an encrypted channel to communicate with its C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure the integrity of the commands and modules.

- **Answer Choice C: T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls**
  - **Description**: Subvert Trust Controls involves manipulating or bypassing security mechanisms that enforce trust, such as code signing.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is related to the initial use of a code signing certificate, it does not directly address the C&C communication aspect of the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1205.001 - Port Knocking**
  - **Description**: Port Knocking involves sending a sequence of connection attempts to specific ports to trigger an action, such as opening a port for communication.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used for C&C communication and is more about establishing initial access or triggering actions.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Evasion**: ChChes uses a code signing certificate to evade detection.
2. **C&C Communication**: After evading detection, the malware needs to communicate with its C&C servers to receive commands and modules.
3. **Relevance of Techniques**:
   - **T1659 (Content Injection)**: Not relevant to C&C communication.
   - **T1573 (Encrypted Channel)**: Highly relevant for secure C&C communication.
   - **T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls)**: Relevant to initial evasion but not to C&C communication.
   - **T1205.001 (Port Knocking)**: Not relevant to C&C communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
