### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware uses process hollowing to inject malicious code and then obfuscates its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Process Hollowing**: A technique where a legitimate process is created in a suspended state, and its memory is replaced with malicious code.
  - **Obfuscation of Second-Stage Payload**: The malware disguises its second-stage payload as an image file to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of various methods to obfuscate or encrypt files or information to avoid detection by security tools.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the obfuscation of the second-stage payload. The malware is likely using this technique to disguise the payload as an image file.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of resource forks, which are a legacy feature of macOS, to store additional data in a file.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to macOS and is not commonly used in the context of obfuscating payloads in a general sense. It is less likely to be the correct answer.

- **Answer Choice C: T1561-Disk Wipe**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the deletion of data from a disk to prevent recovery.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not related to the obfuscation of a payload or the injection of malicious code. It is not relevant to the described attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the discovery of network connections to understand the network environment.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used for reconnaissance and is not directly related to the obfuscation of a payload or the injection of malicious code. It is not relevant to the described attack sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a sequence where the malware uses process hollowing to inject malicious code and then obfuscates its second-stage payload by disguising it as an image file.
  - The technique that best fits the obfuscation of the second-stage payload is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.
  - The other techniques (T1564.009, T1561, and T1049) do not align with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
