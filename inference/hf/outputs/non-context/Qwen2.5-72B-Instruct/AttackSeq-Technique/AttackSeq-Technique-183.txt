### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor "Infamous Chisel." The sequence includes:
1. Scraping files containing sensitive data.
2. Deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces.
3. Using the `netd` component to enumerate directories and perform IP scanning for system discovery.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. The question mentions deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces, which aligns with this technique.

- **B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions. While this could be part of the attack, it is not specifically mentioned in the sequence described.

- **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**
  - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to discover potential targets. The question mentions using the `netd` component to perform IP scanning, which aligns with this technique. However, this is part of the system discovery phase, which occurs after the initial data scraping and network sniffing.

- **D: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from the keychain. The question does not mention any credential theft or keychain-related activities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Scraping files containing sensitive data**:
   - This is not directly an ATT&CK technique but is part of the data exfiltration process.

2. **Deploying `tcpdump` to sniff network interfaces**:
   - This aligns with **T1040-Network Sniffing**.

3. **Using the `netd` component to enumerate directories and perform IP scanning**:
   - This aligns with **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**.

Given the sequence described, the most plausible initial technique that aligns with the activities of scraping files and deploying `tcpdump` is **T1040-Network Sniffing**.

### Final Answer: A: T1040-Network Sniffing
