### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After Infamous Chisel automatically collects files from the local system and application directories, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to exfiltrate these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections?
- **Key Points**:
  - Files are collected from local system and application directories.
  - Exfiltration is done using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - **B: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - **C: T1614-System Location Discovery**
  - **D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Evaluate T1020-Automated Exfiltration**:
   - **Description**: This technique involves the automatic transfer of collected data from a victim's system to an attacker-controlled system.
   - **Relevance**: The question mentions that files are collected and then exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. This aligns perfectly with the concept of automated exfiltration.

2. **Evaluate T1614-System Location Discovery**:
   - **Description**: This technique involves identifying the physical or logical location of a system.
   - **Relevance**: The question does not mention any activity related to discovering the location of the system. It focuses on the collection and exfiltration of files.

3. **Evaluate T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**:
   - **Description**: This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with requests to cause a denial of service.
   - **Relevance**: The question does not mention any denial of service or resource exhaustion activities. It is focused on data exfiltration.

### Conclusion
- **Final Answer**: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
