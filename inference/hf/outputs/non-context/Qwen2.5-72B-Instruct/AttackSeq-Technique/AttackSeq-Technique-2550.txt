### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Milestone backdoor has already communicated with a C2 (Command and Control) server to send information about current sessions. The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure data exfiltration over the same communication channel.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - Network Sniffing involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. This technique is typically used to gather information about network activity, but it does not directly relate to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.

- **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - System Information Discovery involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, installed software, and user accounts. This technique is useful for reconnaissance but does not directly relate to exfiltrating data over a C2 channel.

- **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel involves using the same communication channel that was established for command and control to exfiltrate data. This technique directly aligns with the scenario described in the question, where data is being exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communication.

- **D: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook**
  - Exfiltration Over Webhook involves using webhooks to exfiltrate data. While this is a valid exfiltration technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the context of the C2 channel used by the Milestone backdoor.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the Milestone backdoor has already communicated with a C2 server to send information about current sessions.
- The next logical step in the attack sequence is to exfiltrate data over the same communication channel.
- Among the given choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most relevant and directly aligns with the described scenario.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
