### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Welcome Chat app. The sequence is as follows:
1. The app ensured its functionality was activated at every device startup.
2. The app exfiltrated sent and received SMS messages, call logs, and other sensitive user data.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1114-Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email messages from a victim's email client. It is not directly related to ensuring the app's functionality at startup or exfiltrating SMS messages and call logs.

- **B: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems. It is not relevant to the app's functionality at startup or data exfiltration.

- **C: T1007-System Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying system services and their configurations. It could be relevant if the app needed to understand the system's services to ensure its functionality at startup.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other details. This information could be useful for the app to ensure it is properly configured to run at startup and to identify the data it needs to exfiltrate.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1114-Email Collection** and **T1078.001-Default Accounts** are not relevant to the described sequence of ensuring the app's functionality at startup and exfiltrating data.
2. **T1007-System Service Discovery** could be relevant, but it is more specific to understanding system services, which might not be necessary for the app's primary goal of ensuring startup and exfiltration.
3. **T1082-System Information Discovery** is the most plausible choice because it involves gathering information about the system, which is essential for the app to ensure it is properly configured to run at startup and to identify the data it needs to exfiltrate.

### Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery
