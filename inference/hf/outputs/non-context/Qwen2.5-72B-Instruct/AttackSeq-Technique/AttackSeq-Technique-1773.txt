### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Sayad malware is collecting data such as keystrokes, clipboard contents, and VPN-related account information. Before this data collection, the malware needs to gather details about the applications installed in the compromised environment. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique was most likely used for this initial reconnaissance.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it can be used to gather information, it is more general and not specifically focused on discovering software.

- **B: T1087.002-Domain Account**
  - This technique involves the use of domain accounts to gather information. It is more related to identity and access management and not specifically about discovering software.

- **C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying installed software and applications on a system. This is directly relevant to the scenario where the malware needs to gather details about the applications installed in the compromised environment.

- **D: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect credentials. It is not related to discovering software or applications.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Goal**: The malware needs to gather details about the applications installed in the compromised environment.
2. **Evaluate Techniques**:
   - **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: General technique, not specific to software discovery.
   - **T1087.002-Domain Account**: Related to identity and access, not software discovery.
   - **T1518-Software Discovery**: Directly relevant to discovering installed software.
   - **T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**: Not related to software discovery.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for gathering details about the applications installed in the compromised environment is T1518-Software Discovery.

Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery
