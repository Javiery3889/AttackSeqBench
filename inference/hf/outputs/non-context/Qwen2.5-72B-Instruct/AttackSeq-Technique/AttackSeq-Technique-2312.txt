### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The adversary used discovery commands (PsLogList) to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log. After this, the adversary exfiltrated data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Discovery**: Extracting contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
  - **Exfiltration**: Using a custom-built tool to send data to cloud storage web services.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
  - **Description**: Capturing credentials from web portals.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the extraction of event logs or the exfiltration of data. It is more focused on credential harvesting from web portals.

- **Answer Choice B: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - **Description**: Collecting data from the local system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns with the extraction of contents from the Windows Security Event Log. It is a logical step between discovery and exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice C: T1218.014-MMC**
  - **Description**: Using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about executing code using MMC, which is not directly related to the extraction of event logs or the exfiltration of data.

- **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - **Description**: Exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about exfiltrating data, which is the final step in the sequence described. However, the question asks for the technique that occurred **after** the extraction of event logs and **before** exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery**: The adversary used PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log.
2. **Collection**: The next logical step would be to collect the data from the local system, which is what T1005 (Data from Local System) describes.
3. **Exfiltration**: Finally, the data is exfiltrated using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
