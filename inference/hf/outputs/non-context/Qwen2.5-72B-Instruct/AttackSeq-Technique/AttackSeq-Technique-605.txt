### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack. The sequence is as follows:
1. Adversaries deployed public domains like teamtnt[.]red to build their cyber infrastructure for resource development.
2. Attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
  - This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, such as making the data appear normal or to hide malicious activity. This does not fit well between building cyber infrastructure and exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.

- **B: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities and open ports to identify potential targets. This fits well between building cyber infrastructure and exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports, as the attackers would need to scan for misconfigured Docker API ports to exploit them.

- **C: T1590.002-DNS**
  - This sub-technique involves using DNS for various purposes, such as domain generation algorithms or DNS tunneling. While this could be part of the attack, it does not specifically fit the sequence of building infrastructure and then exploiting Docker API ports.

- **D: T1548.003-Sudo and Sudo Caching**
  - This technique involves using sudo to gain elevated privileges. This is more likely to occur after gaining initial access, not before.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Building Cyber Infrastructure**: Adversaries set up public domains like teamtnt[.]red to build their cyber infrastructure.
2. **Active Scanning**: Attackers use active scanning to identify misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
3. **Exploiting Misconfigured Docker API Ports**: Once the misconfigured ports are identified, attackers exploit them for initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning**
