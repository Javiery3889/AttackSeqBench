### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware has already staged data by scanning for files with specific extensions and creating a file containing paths of all files to exfiltrate during the Collection phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is that the malware communicated with the C&C server over ports 80 or 443.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1543.001-Launch Agent**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system startup configuration to achieve persistence. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data, which is the next logical step after communication with the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is typically used for reconnaissance or to gather additional information. It does not align with the exfiltration of previously staged data.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1567.002-Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data to cloud storage services. While this is a form of exfiltration, it is more specific and less common than the general exfiltration techniques.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
     - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the victim's network to an external location. This aligns well with the scenario where the malware has already staged the data and is now communicating with the C&C server to exfiltrate the data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the malware staging data and then communicating with the C&C server. The next logical step would be to exfiltrate the data.
   - Among the given choices, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most plausible technique that would follow the communication with the C&C server, as it directly involves the transfer of the staged data.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
