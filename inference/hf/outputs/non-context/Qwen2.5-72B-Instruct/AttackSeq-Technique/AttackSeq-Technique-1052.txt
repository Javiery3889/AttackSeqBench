### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT. Specifically, it mentions:
1. The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors for bypassing defenses.
2. Encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574.001-DLL Search Order Hijacking**
  - This technique involves manipulating the search order that the operating system uses to locate and load DLLs. It is typically used to execute malicious code when a legitimate application is run. This does not directly relate to the encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

- **B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, such as web browsers, email clients, and other applications. While this could be a part of the attack, it does not directly follow the encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

- **C: T1195.002-Compromise Software Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the software supply chain to deliver malicious code. This is a method of initial access and does not directly relate to the encryption and storage of gathered data in log files.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. This could include encrypting and storing gathered data in log files to make it less detectable. This aligns well with the described sequence of TTPs.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Darkhotel APT used digital certificates to sign backdoors, which helps in bypassing defenses.
2. After gaining access and establishing a foothold, the APT group would likely want to exfiltrate data.
3. To avoid detection, they would encrypt and store the gathered data in log files.
4. The technique that best fits the step of hiding artifacts to avoid detection is T1564-Hide Artifacts.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
