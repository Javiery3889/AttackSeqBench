### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The malware first gathers network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` function API.
   - It then attempts to evade defenses by detecting runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gathering network information using `GetAdaptersInfo()`.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Evading defenses through detection of runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique involves detecting and evading debuggers, which aligns with the described action of detecting debugger presence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**
     - This technique involves disguising files to appear as legitimate, which does not directly relate to gathering network information or evading debuggers.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up persistence at boot or logon, which is not directly related to the described actions.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1597.001-Threat Intel Vendors**
     - This technique involves targeting threat intelligence vendors, which is not relevant to the described actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware first gathers network information, which is a reconnaissance activity.
   - After gathering network information, the malware attempts to evade defenses by detecting runtime checksum changes and debugger presence.
   - The technique that most closely aligns with detecting debugger presence is T1622-Debugger Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1622-Debugger Evasion
