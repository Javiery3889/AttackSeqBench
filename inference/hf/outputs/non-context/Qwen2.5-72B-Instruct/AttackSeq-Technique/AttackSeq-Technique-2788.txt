### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where Iron Tiger deployed malicious JavaScript code into the MiMi chat application's installers for Defense Evasion. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely preceded this by enabling Iron Tiger to compromise MiMi's servers and inject backdoors during the application build process.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Deployment of malicious JavaScript code** for Defense Evasion.
  - **Compromise of MiMi's servers**.
  - **Injection of backdoors** during the application build process.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: This technique involves an adversary compromising a third-party supply chain to deliver malicious content to the target.
  - **Relevance**: This fits well with the scenario because it involves compromising the MiMi chat application's build process, which is a part of the supply chain.

- **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection**
  - **Description**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into existing files or applications.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be part of the process, it is more about the injection itself rather than the initial compromise of the servers.

- **Answer Choice C: T1546.007-Netsh Helper DLL**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying the Netsh helper DLL to execute arbitrary code.
  - **Relevance**: This is a specific technique for persistence and does not directly relate to the initial compromise of the servers or the injection of backdoors during the build process.

- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system.
  - **Relevance**: This is more about communication and does not directly relate to the initial compromise or the injection of backdoors.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Compromise**: The first step in the attack sequence is the compromise of MiMi's servers. This is necessary to gain access to the build process.
2. **Supply Chain Compromise**: Once the servers are compromised, the attackers can inject backdoors into the application during the build process. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack.
3. **Deployment of Malicious Code**: The final step is deploying the malicious JavaScript code into the installers for Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
