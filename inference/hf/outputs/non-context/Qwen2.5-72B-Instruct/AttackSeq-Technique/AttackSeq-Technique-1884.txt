### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor group FIN13:
1. Dumped LSASS process memory.
2. Employed network sniffing to obtain credentials.
3. Leveraged native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between the second and third steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - This technique involves modifying or subverting multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms. It is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining credentials and then using them for internal reconnaissance.

- **B: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates, which is more relevant to initial access or maintaining persistence rather than the sequence described.

- **C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials**
  - This technique involves obtaining credentials from unsecured sources, such as memory, files, or network traffic. This aligns well with the sequence where credentials are obtained through LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing.

- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves gathering information about victim identities, which is more relevant to the reconnaissance phase but does not fit the specific sequence of obtaining credentials and then using them.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **LSASS Memory Dumping**: FIN13 dumped the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
2. **Network Sniffing**: FIN13 employed network sniffing to obtain additional credentials.
3. **Unsecured Credentials**: The credentials obtained from both LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing are unsecured and can be used for further actions.
4. **Internal Reconnaissance**: FIN13 leveraged native OS binaries and custom malware to perform internal reconnaissance using the obtained credentials.

The most plausible technique that fits between obtaining credentials and using them for internal reconnaissance is **T1552-Unsecured Credentials**.

### Final Answer: C: T1552-Unsecured Credentials
