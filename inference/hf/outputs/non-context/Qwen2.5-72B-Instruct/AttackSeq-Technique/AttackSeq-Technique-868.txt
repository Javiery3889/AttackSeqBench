### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where GreyEnergy's operators used spearphishing and the compromise of servers as initial infection vectors.
- **Objective**: Determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers attempted lateral movement.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. However, the question already states that the initial infection vectors were spearphishing and server compromise, so this technique is less likely to be the next step.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to maintain stealth. While this is a common post-compromise technique, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for lateral movement. It can occur at various stages of the attack.

- **Answer Choice C: T1217-Browser Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information from the browser, which is more relevant to reconnaissance and information gathering. While it can be useful, it is not a direct precursor to lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice D: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising the supply chain to gain access to the target. However, the question already states that the initial infection vectors were spearphishing and server compromise, so this technique is not relevant to the next step in the sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial infection vectors were spearphishing and server compromise.
  - After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to establish a foothold and gather information about the network to plan their next steps.
  - The most logical next step before attempting lateral movement would be to hide their presence to avoid detection, which aligns with the technique T1564-Hide Artifacts.
  - While other techniques like T1217-Browser Information Discovery can be useful, they are not as critical for the immediate next step of lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
