### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the CostaRicto Campaign:
1. Payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
2. A PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection was used to inject the final payload DLL into memory.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the PowerShell loader was used to inject the final payload DLL.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1587.003-Digital Certificates**
  - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malware or tools. While it can be part of a campaign, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately before payload injection.

- **B: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. It is more related to network communication and evasion, not directly to the execution of a payload.

- **C: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves using scheduled tasks to execute payloads. The question already mentions that scheduled tasks were used to download the backdoor, so this is a step that has already occurred.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves loading and executing shared modules, such as DLLs, which aligns with the use of a PowerShell loader to inject a DLL into memory.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Scheduled Task/Job (T1053)**: The question states that scheduled tasks were used to download the backdoor. This is a step that has already occurred and is not the technique we are looking for.
2. **Digital Certificates (T1587.003)**: This technique is not directly related to the injection of a payload DLL.
3. **Proxy (T1090)**: This technique is more about network communication and evasion, not the execution of a payload.
4. **Shared Modules (T1129)**: This technique involves loading and executing shared modules, which is exactly what the PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection does to inject the final payload DLL into memory.

Given the sequence described in the question, the most plausible technique that occurred before the PowerShell loader injected the final payload DLL is **T1129-Shared Modules**.

### Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules
