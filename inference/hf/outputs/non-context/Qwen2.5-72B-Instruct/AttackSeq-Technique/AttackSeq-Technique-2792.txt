### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has gathered information from a compromised iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and Wi-Fi status.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server using POST and GET requests.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique used to manipulate the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache on a network device to redirect traffic to an attacker-controlled system. This is typically used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and does not directly facilitate communication with a C2 server using HTTP requests.

- **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
  - Web Service is a technique where an adversary uses legitimate web services to communicate with a C2 server. This can include using HTTP/HTTPS requests (POST and GET) to send and receive data. This aligns well with the described scenario of using POST and GET requests to communicate with a C2 server.

- **Answer Choice C: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - Software Discovery involves identifying installed software and applications on a system. This technique is used to gather information about the environment but does not directly facilitate communication with a C2 server.

- **Answer Choice D: T1001.001-Junk Data**
  - Junk Data is a technique used to obfuscate or add noise to data to make it harder to analyze. This is typically used to evade detection but does not directly facilitate communication with a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes the use of HTTP requests (POST and GET) to communicate with a C2 server. Among the given choices, **T1102-Web Service** is the most appropriate technique that fits this description.
- **T1102-Web Service** involves using legitimate web services to communicate with a C2 server, which aligns with the use of HTTP requests to send and receive data.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
