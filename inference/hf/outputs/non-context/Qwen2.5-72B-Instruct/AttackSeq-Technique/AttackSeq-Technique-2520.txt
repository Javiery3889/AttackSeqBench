### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where BlueDelta exploited Roundcube vulnerabilities to perform discovery activities on system and network information. After this, the attackers secured sensitive victim credentials such as the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Exploitation of Roundcube vulnerabilities** (initial access)
  - **Discovery activities** (system and network information)
  - **Securing sensitive victim credentials** (credential access)

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - **Description**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which aligns with the step of securing sensitive victim credentials.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible technique, but it occurs after the discovery activities.

- **Answer Choice B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves gathering information about the system and network configuration, which aligns with the discovery activities.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible technique and fits the sequence described in the question.

- **Answer Choice C: T1547.014-Active Setup**
  - **Description**: This technique involves persistence through the Active Setup registry key, which is typically used to maintain access over time.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is not directly related to the discovery or credential access phases and is more about persistence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1187-Forced Authentication**
  - **Description**: This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate, which can be used to gain access to credentials.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is more about gaining initial access or forcing a user to authenticate, which is not the focus of the discovery phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: BlueDelta exploited Roundcube vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. **Discovery Activities**: The attackers performed discovery activities to gather system and network information.
3. **Credential Access**: The attackers secured sensitive victim credentials such as the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred after the initial access and before securing credentials is the discovery of system and network configuration information.

**Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
