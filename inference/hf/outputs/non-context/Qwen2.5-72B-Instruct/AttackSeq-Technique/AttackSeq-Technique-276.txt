### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Bandook campaign. The sequence involves:
1. Using URL shortening services to redirect to a domain controlled by the attacker.
2. Executing PowerShell scripts to drop additional files like 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs before the execution of PowerShell scripts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1659-Content Injection**
  - Content Injection involves modifying or adding content to a website or application to manipulate user behavior or gain unauthorized access. This technique is not typically used to redirect URLs or execute PowerShell scripts.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - Encrypted Channel involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality of data in transit. While this technique can be used to secure communication between the attacker and the compromised system, it is not a prerequisite for URL redirection or PowerShell script execution.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - External Remote Services involves using legitimate external remote services to maintain access to a network. This technique is more about maintaining persistence and remote access, not about initial URL redirection or script execution.

- **D: T1584.005-Botnet**
  - Botnet involves using a network of compromised devices to perform various malicious activities. While botnets can be used to distribute malware, they are not typically involved in the initial stages of URL redirection or script execution.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **URL Redirection**: The attacker uses URL shortening services to redirect to a domain they control. This is a common technique to obfuscate the true destination of the URL.
2. **PowerShell Script Execution**: After the redirection, the attacker executes PowerShell scripts to drop additional files. This is a common method for delivering and executing malware.

Given the sequence described, the most likely technique that occurs before the execution of PowerShell scripts is the initial redirection to the attacker-controlled domain. However, none of the provided answer choices directly describe URL redirection. 

The closest technique that aligns with the initial steps of the attack, particularly in the context of maintaining and establishing a connection to the attacker's infrastructure, is **T1133-External Remote Services**. This technique can be used to establish a connection to the attacker's server, which is a necessary step before executing the PowerShell scripts.

### Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services
