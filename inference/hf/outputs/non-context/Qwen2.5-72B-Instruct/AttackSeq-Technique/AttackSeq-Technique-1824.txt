### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where Earth Wendigo's Service Worker script intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API to steal username and password pairs. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP) to communicate with a remote system. While this could be used to exfiltrate the stolen credentials, it is not the most immediate next step after intercepting the credentials.

- **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks. This is not directly related to the interception of credentials or the immediate next step in the attack sequence.

- **C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
  - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to maintain access to a web application. After intercepting the username and password, the attacker might use these credentials to log in and then steal the session cookie to maintain persistent access.

- **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources. This is more relevant to network-level authentication and is not directly related to the webmail login scenario described.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Interception of Credentials**: The Service Worker script intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API to steal username and password pairs.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After obtaining the credentials, the attacker would likely use them to log into the webmail service.
3. **Maintaining Access**: To maintain persistent access, the attacker would likely steal the web session cookie, which is a common technique in web-based attacks.

**Final Answer: C: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
