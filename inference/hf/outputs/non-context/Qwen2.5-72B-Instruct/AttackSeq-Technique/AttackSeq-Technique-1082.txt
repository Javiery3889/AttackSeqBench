### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Lazarus Group used tools like `SMBMap` and system commands (`net user`, `tasklist.exe`) for discovery within the network.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves moving laterally by leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021.006-Windows Remote Management**
  - This technique involves using Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for remote command execution. While it can be used for lateral movement, it does not specifically involve leveraging compromised privileged accounts.

- **Answer Choice B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials (e.g., passwords, hashes, or tokens) to authenticate and move laterally. This aligns well with the scenario where the attacker has already discovered and compromised privileged accounts.

- **Answer Choice C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
  - This technique involves modifying account settings to maintain access or escalate privileges. While it can be part of the attack, it is more about setting up for future access rather than immediate lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice D: T1137.001-Office Template Macros**
  - This technique involves using macros in Office templates to execute code. It is typically used for initial access or persistence, not for lateral movement.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves discovery using `SMBMap` and system commands, followed by lateral movement using compromised privileged accounts.
- The most relevant technique for leveraging compromised privileged accounts for lateral movement is **T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**.
- This technique aligns with the scenario where the attacker has already discovered and compromised accounts and is using them to move laterally.

**Final Answer: B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
