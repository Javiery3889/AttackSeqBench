### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. Malicious scripts are injected into store checkout pages to intercept transaction data.
2. The intercepted data is sent to a collection server.
3. HIDDEN COBRA funnels the stolen assets through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the exfiltration step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used to maintain persistence or evade detection, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials. While it can be used to gain initial access to a system, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of intercepted transaction data.

- **C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**
  - This technique involves setting up a scheduled transfer of data. It could be used to automate the exfiltration process, but it is not the most likely technique to occur immediately before the exfiltration step described in the question.

- **D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols, such as DNS, ICMP, or other non-standard protocols. This is the most relevant technique to the exfiltration step described in the question, where the stolen assets are funneled through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. The question describes the exfiltration of intercepted transaction data.
2. The most relevant technique for exfiltrating data using alternative methods is T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol.
3. The other techniques (T1055.001, T1566, and T1029) are not as directly related to the exfiltration step.

**Final Answer: D: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
