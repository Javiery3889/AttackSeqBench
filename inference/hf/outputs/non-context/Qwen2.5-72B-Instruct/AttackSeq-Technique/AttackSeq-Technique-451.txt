### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the threat actor, Geumseong121, uses a charity website to distribute a malicious app. The app is disguised as unrelated to previously discovered malicious apps, and the goal is to gain access to victims' devices. The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to distribute the malicious app and gain access to victims' devices through the charity website.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
  - This technique involves using removable media (e.g., USB drives) to spread malware. This does not align with the scenario of using a charity website to distribute the app.

- **B: T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**
  - This technique involves modifying logon scripts to execute malicious code. This is typically used in a network environment and does not fit the scenario of distributing an app through a charity website.

- **C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This aligns well with the scenario of using a charity website to distribute a malicious app.

- **D: T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**
  - This technique involves searching for and compromising victim-owned websites. While this could be a step in the broader attack, it does not directly describe the distribution of the malicious app through the charity website.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Context**: The threat actor is using a charity website to distribute a malicious app.
2. **Evaluate the Techniques**:
   - **T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**: Not relevant to web-based distribution.
   - **T1037.001-Logon Script (Windows)**: Not relevant to web-based distribution.
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: Directly relevant to compromising a website to distribute malicious content.
   - **T1594-Search Victim-Owned Websites**: Relevant to finding targets but not directly to distributing the app.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for distributing the malicious app through the charity website is T1189-Drive-by Compromise.

**Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
