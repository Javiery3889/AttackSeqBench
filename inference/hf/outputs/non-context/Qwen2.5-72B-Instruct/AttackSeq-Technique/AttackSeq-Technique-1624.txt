### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that APT28 likely used to facilitate secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll` during data collection. The key points to focus on are:
- Secure communication with C&C servers
- Deployment of the backdoor component `advstoreshell.dll`
- Data collection

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1569 - System Services**
  - This technique involves adversaries using system services to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.

- **B: T1071.001 - Web Protocols**
  - This technique involves using web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication. While it can be used for C&C communication, it does not specifically address secure communication.

- **C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect C&C communications from detection. This is directly relevant to secure communication with C&C servers.

- **D: T1218.014 - MMC**
  - This technique involves using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute malicious code. It does not relate to secure communication with C&C servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Requirement**: The question requires a technique that facilitates secure communication with C&C servers.
2. **Evaluate the Choices**:
   - **A: T1569 - System Services**: Not relevant to secure communication.
   - **B: T1071.001 - Web Protocols**: Relevant to communication but not specifically secure.
   - **C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**: Directly relevant to secure communication.
   - **D: T1218.014 - MMC**: Not relevant to secure communication.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for secure communication with C&C servers is T1573 - Encrypted Channel.

**Final Answer: C: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
