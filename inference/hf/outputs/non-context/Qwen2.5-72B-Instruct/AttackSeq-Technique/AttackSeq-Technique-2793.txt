### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) has been collected from an iOS device.
- The information is then sent out using Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1614-System Location Discovery**: This technique involves an adversary determining the physical or logical location of a system. It is not related to the exfiltration of data.
- **T1132-Data Encoding**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less detectable during exfiltration. Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode data, and adding a random prefix can help evade detection.
- **T1090.004-Domain Fronting**: This technique involves using a different domain in the request's Host header than the domain in the request's URL to hide the true destination of the traffic. While it can be used for exfiltration, it is not specifically about encoding the data.
- **T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**: This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to gain access to a system. It is not related to the exfiltration of data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1614-System Location Discovery** is not relevant to the exfiltration of data.
2. **T1132-Data Encoding** is directly related to the encoding of data to make it less detectable, which matches the description of using Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.
3. **T1090.004-Domain Fronting** is a technique for hiding the true destination of traffic but does not specifically address the encoding of data.
4. **T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools** is not related to the exfiltration of data.

### Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding
