### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker performs DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe` and then ensures that the payload components run or load with every user mode process spawned following a system reboot.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves detecting and evading virtualized environments and sandboxes. It does not align with ensuring that components run or load with every user mode process after a reboot.

- **B: T1036.003-Rename System Utilities**
  - This technique involves renaming system utilities to avoid detection. It does not ensure that components run or load with every user mode process after a reboot.

- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the requirement to run or load components with every user mode process after a reboot.

- **D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence. While it can be used for persistence, it does not specifically ensure that components run with every user mode process after a reboot.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **DLL Sideloading with `igfxtray.exe`**: This is a technique where a legitimate application is used to load a malicious DLL, often to evade detection.
2. **Ensuring Components Run with Every User Mode Process After Reboot**: This requires a mechanism to ensure that the malicious components are executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on.

Given the requirement to ensure that the components run with every user mode process after a reboot, the most appropriate technique is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
