### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus group:
1. They executed credential harvesting using Responder.
2. They gained login credentials for lateral movement.
3. They then moved on to network share and system network connections discovery activities.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the network share and system network connections discovery activities.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574.002-DLL Side-Loading**
  - DLL Side-Loading is a technique where an adversary loads a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one to execute arbitrary code. This technique is typically used for persistence and privilege escalation, not for discovery activities.

- **B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - System Network Connections Discovery involves adversaries identifying active system network connections. This technique is directly related to the discovery of network shares and system network connections, which aligns with the described sequence of activities.

- **C: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol is a technique used to exfiltrate data from a network using protocols other than the standard ones. This technique is not related to discovery activities and would typically occur after the adversary has already gained access and identified valuable data.

- **D: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - System Owner/User Discovery involves identifying the primary user of a system. This technique is useful for understanding the environment and can be a precursor to lateral movement, but it is not directly related to the discovery of network shares and system network connections.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence of actions described involves credential harvesting, gaining login credentials, and then moving on to network share and system network connections discovery.
2. The technique that most logically fits before the network share and system network connections discovery is the discovery of active system network connections.
3. Among the given choices, **T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** is the most relevant and aligns best with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
