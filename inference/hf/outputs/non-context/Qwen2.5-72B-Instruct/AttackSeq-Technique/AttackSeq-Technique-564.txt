### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware has already collected basic system and Bitcoin wallet information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is the initiation of logging activities like screen recording and keylogging.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique fits between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1592.003-Firmware**
     - This technique involves collecting information from firmware, which is not typically a step between collecting system and wallet information and initiating logging activities.
   - **B: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery**
     - This technique involves discovering cloud storage objects, which is not directly related to the sequence of collecting system information and initiating logging activities.
   - **C: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the screen, which is a form of logging activity. However, it is more likely to be part of the logging activities rather than a step before them.
   - **D: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves enumerating logs, which is a logical step before initiating logging activities. The attacker would likely want to understand what logs are available before setting up screen recording and keylogging.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves collecting system and Bitcoin wallet information, followed by logging activities.
   - Before initiating logging activities, the attacker would likely want to understand what logs are available on the system.
   - T1654-Log Enumeration fits this step as it involves identifying and enumerating logs, which is a necessary precursor to setting up screen recording and keylogging.

**Final Answer: D: T1654-Log Enumeration**
