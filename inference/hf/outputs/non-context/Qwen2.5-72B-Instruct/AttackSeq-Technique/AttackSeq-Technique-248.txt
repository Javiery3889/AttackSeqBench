### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers used CertUtil.exe, disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe', to download additional payloads. The task is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this evasion technique.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the specific action of disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.

- **B: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files to appear as legitimate files. This directly aligns with the scenario where CertUtil.exe is disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.

- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to evade detection. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't directly relate to the specific action of disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.

- **D: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting a user's SID history to gain access to resources. This is not related to the specific action of disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the use of CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to download additional payloads.
2. The technique that directly relates to renaming or masquerading files to appear legitimate is T1036-Masquerading.
3. The other techniques (T1059, T1070, and T1134.005) do not directly align with the specific action of disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
