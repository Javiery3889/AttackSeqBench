### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware gathers system information and sends the results to a C&C server.
   - The communication between the malware and the C&C server is established using a beacon that mimics a Firefox browser.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Gathering System Information:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment.
   - **Sending Results to C&C Server:** This indicates the establishment of a communication channel.
   - **Using a Beacon that Mimics a Firefox Browser:** This suggests the use of a specific technique to mask the communication to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1136.003-Cloud Account:** This technique involves creating a cloud account, which is not relevant to the described communication method.
   - **B: T1205.001-Port Knocking:** This technique involves sending a sequence of connection attempts to a series of closed ports to open a port for communication. It does not fit the description of using a beacon that mimics a browser.
   - **C: T1211-Exploitation for Defense Evasion:** This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to evade defenses, which is not directly related to the communication method described.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol:** This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C&C server. Specifically, mimicking a browser (like Firefox) to establish communication aligns well with this technique.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Gathering System Information:**
   - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment. It is not specific to any of the answer choices but sets the context.

2. **Sending Results to C&C Server:**
   - This indicates the establishment of a communication channel, which is a critical part of the attack.

3. **Using a Beacon that Mimics a Firefox Browser:**
   - This is a specific method of communication that aims to blend in with normal traffic to avoid detection. The technique that best fits this description is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

### Final Answer

Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
