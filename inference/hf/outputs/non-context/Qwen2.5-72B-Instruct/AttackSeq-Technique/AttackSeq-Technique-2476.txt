### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence that involves exploiting CVE-2021-40444 for client execution and using PowerShell to deploy the Empire stager. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated access to the victim systems before these actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send fraudulent communications (e.g., emails, messages) to trick victims into providing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, which aligns well with the described attack sequence.

- **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - Drive-by compromise involves attackers compromising a website or web application to deliver malicious content to visitors. This technique can also lead to the execution of malicious code, but it is less targeted and more opportunistic compared to phishing.

- **C: T1556.004-Network Device Authentication**
  - This technique involves manipulating or modifying the authentication of network devices. It is more relevant to maintaining access or pivoting within a network rather than gaining initial access.

- **D: T1136-Create Account**
  - Creating a new account is typically used to establish persistence within a network after initial access has been gained. It is not a technique used to gain initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack sequence starts with gaining access to the victim systems. This is a critical first step.
2. **Phishing (T1566)**: Phishing is a highly effective method for gaining initial access. It can be used to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment, which can then lead to the execution of the CVE-2021-40444 exploit.
3. **Drive-by Compromise (T1189)**: While this can also lead to initial access, it is less targeted and more opportunistic. The question implies a more targeted approach.
4. **Network Device Authentication (T1556.004)**: This technique is more about maintaining access and is not typically used for initial access.
5. **Create Account (T1136)**: This technique is used for persistence and is not relevant to gaining initial access.

Given the context of the attack sequence, the most plausible initial access technique is **Phishing (T1566)**.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
