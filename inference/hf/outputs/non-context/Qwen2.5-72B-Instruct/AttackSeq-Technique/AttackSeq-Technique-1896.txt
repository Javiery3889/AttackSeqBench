### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat group FIN13. It mentions that they used tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and then staged data from network shared drives locally or remotely.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Lateral Movement**: Tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR are used for moving laterally within the network.
  - **Data Staging**: Data is staged from network shared drives locally or remotely.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients. While this could be a part of the data collection process, it is not directly related to the staging of data from network shared drives.

- **Answer Choice B: T1560 - Archive Collected Data**
  - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to make it easier to exfiltrate. This is a logical step after data has been staged, as it prepares the data for transfer.

- **Answer Choice C: T1586.002 - Email Accounts**
  - This technique involves compromising email accounts. While this could be a part of the broader attack, it is not directly related to the staging of data from network shared drives.

- **Answer Choice D: T1132 - Data Encoding**
  - This technique involves encoding data to avoid detection during exfiltration. This is a step that might occur after data has been staged and possibly archived, but it is not the most immediate next step after staging.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - **Lateral Movement**: FIN13 uses tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR to move laterally within the network.
  - **Data Staging**: After gaining access to the network, they stage data from network shared drives locally or remotely.
  - **Next Logical Step**: The most logical next step after staging data is to prepare it for exfiltration. This often involves compressing or archiving the data to make it easier to transfer.
  - **Best Fit**: T1560 (Archive Collected Data) is the most appropriate technique that fits the sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1560 - Archive Collected Data**
