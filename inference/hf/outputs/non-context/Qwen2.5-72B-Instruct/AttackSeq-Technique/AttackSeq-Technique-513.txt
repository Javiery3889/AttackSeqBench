### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Milum Trojan transmitted compressed and encrypted JSON data via HTTP POST requests for C2 (Command and Control) communication.
   - The key points are:
     - The Trojan is transmitting data.
     - The data is compressed and encrypted.
     - The data is sent via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. While this is a common initial persistence technique, it does not directly relate to the transmission of data.
   - **B: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
     - This technique involves using web protocols (like HTTP) for communication. While this is relevant to the HTTP POST requests, it does not specifically address the data encoding or compression.
   - **C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves compromising the infrastructure used for C2 communication, such as servers or domains. This is a broader technique and does not directly relate to the data transmission process.
   - **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it before transmission. This is directly relevant to the compression and encryption of the JSON data before it is sent via HTTP POST requests.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question focuses on the data transmission process, specifically the compression and encryption of the JSON data before it is sent via HTTP POST requests.
   - **T1132-Data Encoding** is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the encoding (which includes compression and encryption) of the data before it is transmitted.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) are either too broad or do not directly relate to the data encoding process.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
