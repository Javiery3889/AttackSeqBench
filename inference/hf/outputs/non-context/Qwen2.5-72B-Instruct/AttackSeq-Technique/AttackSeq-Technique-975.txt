### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the BE2 group.
   - The group executed malicious plugins: 'dstr.dll' for data destruction and 'grc.dll' for backup communication over HTTPS.
   - The group then collected detailed information on the host system, including BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1124-System Time Discovery:** This technique involves discovering the system time, which is not relevant to collecting detailed information about the host system's hardware and software.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery:** This technique involves collecting detailed information about the system, including hardware and software details, which aligns with the described actions of the BE2 group.
   - **T1134.001-Token Impersonation/Theft:** This technique involves stealing or impersonating access tokens, which is not relevant to the collection of system information.
   - **T1485-Data Destruction:** This technique involves destroying data, which is relevant to the execution of 'dstr.dll' but not to the collection of system information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The BE2 group executed 'dstr.dll' for data destruction and 'grc.dll' for backup communication over HTTPS.
   - After these actions, the group collected detailed information on the host system, including BIOS, motherboard, processor, and OS.
   - The technique that best aligns with collecting detailed information about the host system is T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
