### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions involving the use of SparrowDoor for data collection and the exfiltration of data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Data collection using SparrowDoor.
  - Exfiltration of data over the C&C channel.
- **Focus**: The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that likely occurred when SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1055-Process Injection**
  - **Description**: Process injection involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process to execute arbitrary code in the context of that process.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for maintaining persistence or evading detection, but it does not directly relate to communication with a C&C server.

- **Answer Choice B: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
  - **Description**: This technique involves determining the physical location of the target, which can be used for geolocation or other location-based attacks.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to communication with a C&C server or data exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect the confidentiality of data during communication with a C&C server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the communication with a C&C server, as it ensures that the data being exfiltrated is not intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

- **Answer Choice D: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security measures.
  - **Relevance**: This technique can be used to communicate with a C&C server, but it is more about evading detection rather than ensuring the confidentiality of the communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question focuses on the communication between SparrowDoor and the C&C server.
  - The most relevant technique for ensuring secure communication and protecting the data during exfiltration is the use of an encrypted channel.
  - While protocol tunneling (T1572) can also be used for communication, it is more about evading detection rather than ensuring the confidentiality of the data.
  - Process injection (T1055) and determining physical locations (T1591.001) are not directly related to the communication with the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
