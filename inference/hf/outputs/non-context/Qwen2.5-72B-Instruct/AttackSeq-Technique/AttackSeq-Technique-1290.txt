### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a macro is used to decode and run additional encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - The final step is the storage and execution of PRB-Backdoor from a specific directory to maintain long-term presence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Execution of a macro.
   - **Intermediate Action:** Decoding and running additional encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - **Final Action:** Storing and executing PRB-Backdoor to maintain long-term presence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1592.002-Software**
     - This technique involves the use of software to gather information about the target. It does not align with the sequence of actions described, which involves execution and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. This aligns with the intermediate action of running encoded PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This aligns with the final action of maintaining long-term presence by storing and executing PRB-Backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1505-Server Software Component**
     - This technique involves the use of server software to maintain a presence on the network. It does not align with the described sequence, which focuses on local execution and persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial action of executing a macro to decode and run additional encoded PowerShell scripts is a form of command and scripting interpretation (T1059).
   - The final action of storing and executing PRB-Backdoor to maintain long-term presence is a form of boot or logon autostart execution (T1547).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the command and scripting interpreter (T1059) was used to run the PowerShell scripts, which then led to the boot or logon autostart execution (T1547) to maintain the long-term presence.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
