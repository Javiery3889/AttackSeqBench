### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where ScarCruft has established command and control (C2) channels using HTTP requests to specific PHP scripts on their C2 servers.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to send data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1553.005-Mark-of-the-Web Bypass**
  - This technique involves bypassing the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security feature, which is used to prevent the execution of files downloaded from the internet. This is not related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services, such as HTTP or HTTPS. This is a plausible choice because it aligns with the use of HTTP requests to PHP scripts on C2 servers.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules or libraries to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. This is not related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel. This is also a plausible choice because it directly relates to sending data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure using the established C2 channels.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically mentions that ScarCruft has established C2 channels using HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers.
  - The most direct and relevant technique for sending data from compromised hosts to the attacker's infrastructure over these established C2 channels is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
  - While T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service is also a valid technique, it is more general and does not specifically mention the use of established C2 channels.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
