### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. **Discovery**: Retrieving a gist snippet from GitHub to parse commands and gather system information.
2. **Backdoor Use**: Using the SLUB backdoor to collect data from the victim's system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1056.004-Credential API Hooking**
  - This technique involves hooking into API functions to capture credentials. While this could be part of a broader attack, it doesn't directly align with the described sequence of using a backdoor to collect data.

- **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
  - This technique involves poisoning network protocols to capture and relay authentication requests. This is more related to network manipulation and credential theft, which doesn't fit the context of using a backdoor to collect data.

- **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - This technique involves degrading or disabling security controls. While this could be a step in a broader attack, it doesn't directly align with the described sequence of using a backdoor to collect data.

- **D: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen. This aligns well with the described sequence, as using a backdoor to collect data could include capturing the screen to gather sensitive information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery**: The attacker retrieves a gist snippet from GitHub to parse commands and gather system information.
2. **Backdoor Use**: The SLUB backdoor is used to collect data from the victim's system.
3. **Data Collection**: One of the data collection techniques that aligns with the use of a backdoor is screen capture (T1113).

**Final Answer: D: T1113-Screen Capture**
