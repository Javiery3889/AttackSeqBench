### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where the malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion.
- After the defense evasion, the malware gathers detailed system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. It does not align with the described sequence of gathering system information after defense evasion.

- **Answer Choice B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves the adversary discovering system network connections, including active TCP connections and network configurations. This aligns well with the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1580-Cloud Infrastructure Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering cloud infrastructure, which is not relevant to the described sequence of gathering system information on a local network.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying autostart entries to achieve persistence. It does not align with the described sequence of gathering system information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion, which is a technique to avoid detection and analysis.
- After evading defenses, the malware gathers detailed system information, specifically network configurations and active TCP connections.
- The technique that best matches this behavior is T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, as it involves discovering system network connections and active TCP connections.

**Final Answer: B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
