### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT10 uses malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT to establish a foothold on a target network.
   - The initial compromise is achieved through spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with a spear phishing campaign.
   - The spear phishing campaign includes malicious attachments or links.
   - The goal is to compromise the target and deploy malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1539-Steal Web Session Cookie**
     - This technique involves stealing web session cookies to gain unauthorized access to web applications. It is not typically used as an initial access method but rather as a post-compromise technique.
   - **B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols. It is a post-compromise technique used to steal data, not to gain initial access.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target. It is a broad category that includes various types of phishing attacks.
   - **D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service**
     - This technique is a specific type of phishing where the attacker uses a service (like email or social media) to send spear phishing messages. It is a more targeted and sophisticated form of phishing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions spear phishing campaigns with malicious attachments or links.
   - **T1566-Phishing** (Choice C) is a broad category that includes spear phishing, but it is not as specific as **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** (Choice D).
   - **T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service** (Choice D) is the most precise match for the described scenario, as it involves targeted phishing campaigns using services like email, which is a common method for delivering malicious attachments or links.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service
