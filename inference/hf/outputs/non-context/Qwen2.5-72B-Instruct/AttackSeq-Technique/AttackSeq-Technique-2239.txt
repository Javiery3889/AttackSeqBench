### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a keylogger is used to capture keystrokes for credential access.
- After capturing the credentials, Rocket Kitten breached websites to set up phishing pages under the guise of fake identities.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1056.001-Keylogging**: This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather credentials. This is mentioned in the question as the initial step.
- **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's environment. This is not directly related to setting up phishing pages.
- **T1656-Impersonation**: This technique involves an adversary assuming a false identity to trick individuals, organizations, or systems. This aligns with the description of setting up phishing pages under the guise of fake identities.
- **T1218.010-Regsvr32**: This technique involves using the Regsvr32 utility to execute arbitrary code. This is not directly related to setting up phishing pages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step is the execution of a keylogger (T1056.001-Keylogging) to capture keystrokes for credential access.
2. After obtaining the credentials, the next logical step is to use these credentials to breach websites and set up phishing pages.
3. Setting up phishing pages under the guise of fake identities involves impersonation (T1656-Impersonation).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- T1056.001-Keylogging (initial step)
- T1656-Impersonation (subsequent step to set up phishing pages)

### Final Answer: C: T1656-Impersonation
