### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of events involving malware like Alchimist establishing Initial Access using port-bound remote shell backdoors, and then Gimmick or macOS.Macma malware using similarly labeled persistence agents. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two stages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
  - This technique involves modifying the way programs are loaded or executed to run malicious code. It is often used for persistence and can occur after initial access but before more sophisticated persistence mechanisms are established.

- **B: T1546-Event Triggered Execution**
  - This technique involves configuring system features to execute malicious code when certain events occur. It is a common method for establishing persistence and can be used after initial access to ensure the malware runs consistently.

- **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. It is typically used for initial access and not for maintaining persistence after initial access has been established.

- **D: T1526-Cloud Service Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying and enumerating cloud services to understand the environment. It is more relevant to reconnaissance and can occur after initial access but is not typically used for persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access**: Malware like Alchimist establishes initial access using port-bound remote shell backdoors.
2. **Persistence**: Gimmick or macOS.Macma malware uses similarly labeled persistence agents.

Given the sequence, we need a technique that fits between initial access and the establishment of more sophisticated persistence mechanisms.

- **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** and **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** are both relevant to persistence.
- **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** is more about modifying the execution flow, which can be a step towards more sophisticated persistence.
- **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** is a direct method for establishing persistence, which aligns well with the use of persistence agents by Gimmick or macOS.Macma.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that **T1546-Event Triggered Execution** occurred after initial access and before the use of more sophisticated persistence agents.

### Final Answer: C: T1546-Event Triggered Execution
