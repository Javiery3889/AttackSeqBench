### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers:
1. **Credential Dumping** using Cobalt Strike Beacon.
2. **Log File Clearing** to conceal their activity.
3. **Executing processes on remote computers** to propagate across the network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact**
  - This technique involves encrypting data to deny access to system resources, which is typically used in ransomware attacks. It does not align with the described sequence of executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

- **B: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - This technique involves modifying shared content to manipulate victims. It is not related to remote execution or network propagation.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using various remote services to execute commands on remote systems. This aligns well with the described sequence of executing processes on remote computers to propagate across the network.

- **D: T1583.004-Server**
  - This technique involves using a server to support malicious activities, but it does not specifically describe the execution of processes on remote computers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Dumping** using Cobalt Strike Beacon is a common initial step to gain access to credentials.
2. **Log File Clearing** is used to cover tracks and avoid detection.
3. **Executing processes on remote computers** is a clear indication of lateral movement, which is best described by the **T1021-Remote Services** technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
