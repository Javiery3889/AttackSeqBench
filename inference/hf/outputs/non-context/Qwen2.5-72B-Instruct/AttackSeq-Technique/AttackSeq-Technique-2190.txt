### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Reconnaissance**: Earth Lusca used tools like PowerSploit to gather information about the target network.
- **Discovery**: They identified machines in the same domain.
- **Execution**: They created a fake system update service to execute malicious code.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into clicking on links or opening attachments. While phishing can be used to gain initial access, it is not typically used after reconnaissance and discovery but before execution.
- **B: T1027.005-Indicator Removal from Tools**: This technique involves removing or modifying indicators of compromise from tools used in the attack. This is more likely to occur after the attack has been executed to avoid detection.
- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**: This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to the target network. This could be a plausible step after reconnaissance and discovery, as the attackers might use remote services to establish a foothold before executing malicious code.
- **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**: This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect. This is more likely to occur during or after the execution of the attack to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: Earth Lusca used PowerSploit to gather information.
2. **Discovery**: They identified machines in the same domain.
3. **Next Step**: The attackers need to gain access to the target machines to execute their malicious code.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - **Phishing (A)**: Not likely to occur after reconnaissance and discovery but before execution.
   - **Indicator Removal (B)**: More likely to occur after execution.
   - **External Remote Services (C)**: Plausible step to gain access after reconnaissance and discovery.
   - **Data Obfuscation (D)**: More likely to occur during or after execution.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
