### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the OceanLotus group during Operation Cobalt Kitty. Specifically, it mentions that PowerShell scripts were used to load additional payloads and scripts from a command-and-control (C2) server. The question asks which ATT&CK technique facilitated the continuous operation of their fileless in-memory payload delivery infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it is relevant to the initial execution of PowerShell scripts, it does not specifically address the continuous operation of the fileless in-memory payload.

- **B: T1137.003-Outlook Forms**
  - This technique involves using Outlook forms to execute code. It is not typically used for continuous operation of fileless in-memory payloads and is more specific to email-based attacks.

- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malicious code runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a common method to maintain persistence and ensure that the fileless in-memory payload continues to operate even after a system reboot.

- **D: T1036.008-Masquerade File Type**
  - This technique involves disguising malicious files as legitimate files to avoid detection. While it can be used to hide the presence of malicious code, it does not directly facilitate the continuous operation of fileless in-memory payloads.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The use of PowerShell scripts to load additional payloads and scripts from a C2 server is covered by T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
2. **Continuous Operation**: To ensure that the fileless in-memory payload continues to operate, the attackers need a mechanism to maintain persistence. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the most relevant technique for this purpose.
3. **Other Techniques**: T1137.003-Outlook Forms and T1036.008-Masquerade File Type do not directly address the continuous operation of fileless in-memory payloads.

**Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
