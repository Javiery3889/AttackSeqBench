### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through exploiting MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761. The next step in the attack sequence involves bypassing standard detection methods to allow the BlackEnergy malware to operate undetected.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Initial Access: Exploiting MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761.
  - Bypassing Detection: The technique used to avoid detection by standard security measures.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain remote access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: While RDP can be used for lateral movement, it is not typically used to bypass detection methods. It is more about gaining access to a system remotely.

- **Answer Choice B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to understand or detect.
  - **Relevance**: Obfuscation is a common method used by malware to bypass detection by security software. It aligns well with the need to avoid detection after gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice C: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - **Description**: This technique involves deploying a container to run malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: Deploying a container is not typically a method used to bypass detection. It is more about running code in an isolated environment.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is a method for initial access, not for bypassing detection after initial access has been gained.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access is gained through exploiting MS Office documents with CVE-2014-1761.
  - After gaining initial access, the next logical step to avoid detection is to use obfuscation techniques to hide the malware from security software.
  - Obfuscation (T1027) is a well-known method used by malware to bypass detection, making it the most plausible choice in this context.

**Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
