### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing shellcode through chained exploits.
     - Downloading and running 'dropper.dll'.
     - Implementing checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges **before** implementing checks for security software.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. While this can be useful for the attacker, it does not directly escalate privileges.
   - **B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system to gain higher privileges. This is a critical step for allowing malware to execute with system privileges.
   - **C: T1546.016-Installer Packages**
     - This technique involves using installer packages to execute code. While it can be used to install malware, it does not inherently escalate privileges.
   - **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
     - This technique involves using cloud services to gain access to a system. It is not directly related to privilege escalation.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves executing shellcode, downloading and running a dropper, and then checking for security software. The step that is missing and necessary for the malware to execute with system privileges is privilege escalation.
   - **T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation** is the most logical choice because it directly addresses the need to gain higher privileges before the malware can fully operate and avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation**
