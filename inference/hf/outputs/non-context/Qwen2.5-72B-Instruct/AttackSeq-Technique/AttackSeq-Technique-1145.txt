### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group GroundPeony:
1. **Spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs** to deliver malicious payloads.
2. **Evading defense mechanisms** using DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1218.004-InstallUtil**
  - **Description**: InstallUtil is a .NET utility that can be used to execute arbitrary code. It is often used to execute payloads after they have been delivered.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be used to execute the payload delivered via spear-phishing. However, it is more likely to be used after the payload is delivered and before evasion techniques are employed.

- **B: T1053.002-At**
  - **Description**: The "At" command is used to schedule tasks on a system. It can be used to execute payloads at a specific time.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used to schedule the execution of a payload. It could be used after the payload is delivered but before evasion techniques are employed.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - **Description**: Web Service involves using legitimate web services to host and deliver malicious content or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to deliver the initial payload or to maintain persistence. It could be used after the spear-phishing email delivers the payload but before evasion techniques are employed.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - **Description**: Shared Modules involves using shared libraries or modules to execute code. This can be used to load and execute payloads.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to load and execute payloads, but it is more commonly associated with the initial execution phase rather than the evasion phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Delivery**: GroundPeony uses spear-phishing emails with obfuscated URLs to deliver the malicious payload.
2. **Execution**: The payload needs to be executed on the target system. Techniques like T1218.004 (InstallUtil) or T1053.002 (At) could be used to execute the payload.
3. **Evasion**: After the payload is executed, GroundPeony uses DLL side-loading and custom XOR operations to evade defense mechanisms.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that fits between the initial delivery and the evasion phase is **T1053.002-At**. This technique is commonly used to schedule the execution of the payload, which would naturally occur after the payload is delivered and before the evasion techniques are employed.

**Final Answer: B: T1053.002-At**
