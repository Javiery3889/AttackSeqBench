### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries first gather information about vulnerabilities in the target, then exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix systems, and finally use password spraying techniques for initial access.
- The focus is on the initial phase of gathering information about vulnerabilities, which is part of the Reconnaissance phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**: This technique involves hiding the true nature of files or information to evade detection. It is not related to the initial gathering of information about vulnerabilities.
- **T1595-Active Scanning**: This technique involves actively probing and scanning the target's systems to identify vulnerabilities and other useful information. This aligns well with the Reconnaissance phase.
- **T1589.001-Credentials**: This sub-technique involves collecting credentials, which is typically done after gaining initial access, not during the Reconnaissance phase.
- **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves manipulating the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to inject malicious code. It is used for persistence and execution, not for gathering information about vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question asks for the technique most likely involved in gathering information about vulnerabilities in the target during the Reconnaissance phase.
- **T1595-Active Scanning** is the most appropriate choice because it involves actively probing and scanning the target's systems to identify vulnerabilities, which is a key activity in the Reconnaissance phase.
- The other techniques (T1027, T1589.001, and T1546.012) do not align with the initial information gathering phase.

**Final Answer: B: T1595-Active Scanning**
