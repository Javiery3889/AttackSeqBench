### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where BlackEnergy 3 malware gained initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: The initial access was through exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - **Description**: This technique involves scheduling a job using container orchestration tools.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used immediately after gaining initial access through a vulnerability. It is more relevant to persistence and execution in a containerized environment.

- **Answer Choice B: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves concealing the attacker's infrastructure to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used after gaining initial access, it is not the most immediate or common next step after exploiting a vulnerability.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204-User Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to gain initial access, but in this scenario, initial access has already been gained through the exploitation of a vulnerability. Therefore, it is not the most plausible next step.

- **Answer Choice D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
  - **Description**: This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers to prevent analysis of the malware.
  - **Relevance**: After gaining initial access, it is common for malware to attempt to evade detection and analysis. This technique is a plausible next step to ensure the malware can operate undetected.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The malware gained initial access through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
- **Next Logical Step**: After gaining initial access, the malware would likely attempt to evade detection and analysis to ensure it can continue its operations.
- **Evaluation of Choices**:
  - **A**: Not relevant to the immediate next step.
  - **B**: Possible but not the most immediate or common next step.
  - **C**: Not relevant as initial access has already been gained.
  - **D**: Most plausible next step to ensure the malware remains undetected.

**Final Answer: D: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
