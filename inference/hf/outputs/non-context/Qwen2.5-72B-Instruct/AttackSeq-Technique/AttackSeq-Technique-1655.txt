### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability is used for initial access. After gaining initial access, the attackers customized Android backdoors to collect SMS messages and call information for command and control purposes. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the customization of the Android backdoors.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1552.007-Container API**: This technique involves accessing sensitive information from container APIs. It is not directly related to the initial access or the customization of Android backdoors for command and control.

- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as usernames, passwords, and other personal data. While this could be useful for initial access, it is not directly related to the customization of Android backdoors for command and control.

- **C: T1547.012-Print Processors**: This technique involves modifying print processors to execute arbitrary code. It is not relevant to the context of initial access or the customization of Android backdoors.

- **D: T1056-Input Capture**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, screen captures, and other forms of input. This is a plausible technique that could be used to gather information necessary for customizing Android backdoors, such as login credentials or other sensitive data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attackers used an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain initial access.
2. **Gathering Information**: Before customizing Android backdoors, the attackers would likely need to gather information about the victim's environment, such as login credentials or other sensitive data.
3. **Customization of Android Backdoors**: Using the gathered information, the attackers would then customize Android backdoors to collect SMS messages and call information for command and control purposes.

Given the context, the most plausible technique that would occur before customizing the Android backdoors is **T1056-Input Capture**. This technique allows the attackers to gather the necessary information to proceed with the customization of the backdoors.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
