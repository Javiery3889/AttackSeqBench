### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already obtained credentials by decrypting stored Chrome passwords. The next step in the attack involves gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes for archiving personal data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from centralized stores, such as databases or file shares. It does not specifically relate to gathering clipboard contents or keystrokes.

- **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the victim's network. It is not directly related to the collection of clipboard contents or keystrokes.

- **C: T1055.002-Portable Executable Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically related to the collection of clipboard contents or keystrokes.

- **D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input at the point where it is entered, such as keystrokes or clipboard contents. This aligns perfectly with the described process of gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has already obtained credentials by decrypting stored Chrome passwords.
2. The next step involves gathering clipboard contents and keystrokes.
3. Among the given choices, T1056-Input Capture is the technique that specifically involves capturing user input, which includes keystrokes and clipboard contents.

**Final Answer: D: T1056-Input Capture**
