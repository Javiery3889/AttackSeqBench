### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where a malicious Flash file containing the 'show.swf' exploit is used to install a payload.
- The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (like Flash) to execute malicious code. While this is part of the initial exploitation, it does not address the method of avoiding detection.
- **T1218.007-Msiexec**: This technique involves using the Windows Installer (msiexec) to execute malicious code. This is not relevant to the scenario of embedding a payload in an animated GIF.
- **T1552.006-Group Policy Preferences**: This technique involves using Group Policy Preferences to execute malicious code. This is not relevant to the scenario of embedding a payload in an animated GIF.
- **T1564-Hide Artifacts**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. Embedding a payload in an animated GIF image is a method of hiding the payload to avoid detection by security tools.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (Flash) to execute the malicious code. This is covered by T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution.
2. After the initial exploitation, the payload is embedded in an animated GIF image to avoid detection. This is a method of hiding the payload, which aligns with T1564-Hide Artifacts.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
