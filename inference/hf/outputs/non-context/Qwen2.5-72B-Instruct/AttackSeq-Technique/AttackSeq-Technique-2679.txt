### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where ZoxPNG, a malware, establishes initial contact with a C2 (Command and Control) server through HTTP GET requests by sending a PNG file containing instructions or data. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this initial contact.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. Since the question already mentions that ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET requests, this technique is part of the communication itself, not a precursor to it.

- **B: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
  - This technique involves using fast flux DNS to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with a domain to make it harder to track and block the C2 server. While this can be used to maintain communication, it is not a necessary step before the initial contact.

- **C: T1110.004-Credential Stuffing**
  - This technique involves using automated scripts to test large numbers of username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This is typically used for gaining initial access to a system, not for establishing C2 communication.

- **D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and perform actions. This could be used to prepare the system for C2 communication, such as setting up network connections or loading necessary libraries.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The initial contact with the C2 server through HTTP GET requests implies that the malware has already gained some level of access to the system and is ready to communicate.
  - Before this communication, the malware likely needed to perform some actions to prepare the system, such as setting up the necessary network connections or loading required libraries.
  - T1106-Native API is a technique that fits this preparation phase, as it involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system and perform necessary actions to facilitate the C2 communication.

- **Final Answer:**
  - Final Answer: D: T1106-Native API
