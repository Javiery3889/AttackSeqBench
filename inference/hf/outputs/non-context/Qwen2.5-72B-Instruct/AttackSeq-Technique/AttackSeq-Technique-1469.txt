### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker has already exploited CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation and is planning to use GitHub gists for discovery.
- **Key TTPs**: The question asks about the technique used to ensure the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves modifying or subverting multi-factor authentication mechanisms. It is not related to ensuring persistence or system startup.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1546.010-AppInit DLLs**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into processes that use the AppInit DLLs registry key. This can be used to ensure that the backdoor is loaded at system startup.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible technique for ensuring persistence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is typically used for exfiltrating visual data. It is not related to ensuring persistence or system startup.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves various methods to ensure that a backdoor or malicious code is executed at system boot or user logon. This is a broad category that includes several sub-techniques, such as registry run keys, scheduled tasks, and AppInit DLLs.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a highly relevant technique for ensuring persistence and aligns well with the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question asks about ensuring the SLUB backdoor remains active upon system startup.
  - **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs** and **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** are both relevant to persistence.
  - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is a broader category that includes **T1546.010-AppInit DLLs** and other methods, making it a more comprehensive and likely choice.
  - **T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication** and **T1113-Screen Capture** are not relevant to the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
