### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions:
1. Ensuring the integrity of the malicious payload using a sha256 checksum.
2. Bypassing detection with an encrypted shellcode.
3. Loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - This technique involves deploying a container to execute malicious code. While it can be used to run malicious payloads, it does not specifically address the loading of a DLL or the execution of decrypted shellcode.

- **B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions that can be used to load and execute code. This is a plausible choice because loading a DLL and executing code often involves calling native APIs such as `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`.

- **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with a command and control server. While it is relevant to the encryption of data, it does not directly address the loading of a DLL or the execution of decrypted shellcode.

- **D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection. While it can be used to hide the presence of malicious code, it does not specifically address the loading of a DLL or the execution of decrypted shellcode.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where the payload is ensured to be intact, bypasses detection, and then is loaded and executed.
2. The most relevant technique for loading a DLL and executing code is **T1106-Native API**.
3. The other techniques (T1610, T1573, and T1564) do not directly address the specific action of loading a DLL and executing the decrypted payload.

**Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API**
