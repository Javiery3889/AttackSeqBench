### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a Remote Access Tool (RAT) called Comfoo. The sequence includes:
1. Gathering system and network information.
2. Encrypting C2 (Command and Control) traffic in an HTTP request.
3. The C2 server acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - This technique involves modifying shared content to manipulate or influence the behavior of a system. It does not fit the scenario of a C2 server acting as a relay point.

- **B: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems. This fits well with the scenario where the C2 server acts as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console.

- **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for the application layer to communicate. While it could be relevant to the encryption of C2 traffic, it does not specifically describe the relay function of the C2 server.

- **D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes or screen captures. It does not fit the scenario of a C2 server acting as a relay point.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a C2 server acting as a relay point to pass traffic between victims and the master console.
2. The technique that best fits this description is T1090-Proxy, which involves using a proxy to route network traffic.
3. The other techniques (T1080, T1095, and T1056) do not align with the relay function described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
