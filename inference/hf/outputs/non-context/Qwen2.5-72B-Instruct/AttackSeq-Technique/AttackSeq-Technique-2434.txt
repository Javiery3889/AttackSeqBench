### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses thread hijacking to inject a payload into the 'fwmain32.exe' process. Before this, the attacker needs to identify the 'fwmain32.exe' process as part of the banking environment.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Thread Hijacking**: T1055 (Process Injection)
  - **Identifying 'fwmain32.exe'**: This is the step we need to identify.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to identifying a specific process on the local system.

- **Answer Choice B: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary identifying running processes on a system.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because the attacker needs to discover the 'fwmain32.exe' process before injecting the payload into it.

- **Answer Choice C: T1548.005-Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**
  - **Description**: This technique involves temporarily elevating privileges in a cloud environment.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the local process discovery and injection scenario.

- **Answer Choice D: T1615-Group Policy Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary identifying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and settings.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to identifying a specific process on the local system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Thread Hijacking (T1055)**: The attacker injects the payload into the 'fwmain32.exe' process.
2. **Identifying 'fwmain32.exe'**: Before injecting the payload, the attacker must first identify the 'fwmain32.exe' process.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that aligns with identifying a specific process is **T1057-Process Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
