### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Grandoreiro malware to evade detection and then collect information about the system.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Evasion Techniques**: Hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software and checking for debugging tools.
  - **Information Collection**: Collecting information about the username and other system details.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering network connections and open ports on the system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to collecting information about the username or system details. It is more focused on network-related information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using the `COR_PROFILER` environment variable to inject a profiler into managed code, which can be used for code execution and manipulation.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about code injection and manipulation, not about collecting system information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves identifying the system's owner and the primary user.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the need to collect information about the username and other system details.

- **Answer Choice D: T1055-Process Injection**
  - **Description**: This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute it in the context of that process.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about code execution and persistence, not about collecting system information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions collecting information about the username and other system details.
  - Among the given choices, **T1033-System Owner/User Discovery** is the most relevant technique for this purpose.
  - The other techniques (T1049, T1574.012, and T1055) are more focused on network discovery, code injection, and process manipulation, which do not directly align with the information collection goal.

**Final Answer: C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
