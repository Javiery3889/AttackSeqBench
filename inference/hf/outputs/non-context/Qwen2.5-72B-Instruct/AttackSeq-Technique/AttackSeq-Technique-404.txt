### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Gholee malware avoided detection through mechanisms to hide from debuggers and employed obfuscation techniques. The key points to focus on are:
- Avoiding detection from debuggers
- Employing obfuscation techniques

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot**
  - This technique involves shutting down or rebooting a system to clear out evidence or to force a reboot to execute a payload. It is not directly related to avoiding detection or obfuscation.

- **B: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves renaming or masquerading files, directories, or services to make them appear legitimate. While this can help in avoiding detection, it is not specifically about hiding from debuggers or obfuscation.

- **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code**
  - This technique involves using code that changes its appearance every time it runs but still performs the same function. This is a form of obfuscation and can help in avoiding detection from debuggers and other security tools.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is not directly related to avoiding detection or obfuscation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Avoiding Detection from Debuggers**: This requires techniques that make the malware harder to analyze and understand.
2. **Employing Obfuscation Techniques**: This involves making the code or data harder to read or understand, which can include polymorphic code.
3. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **A: T1529-System Shutdown/Reboot** is not relevant to the described techniques.
   - **B: T1036-Masquerading** is related to avoiding detection but not specifically to hiding from debuggers or obfuscation.
   - **C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code** directly involves obfuscation and can help in avoiding detection from debuggers.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is not relevant to the described techniques.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code
