### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Rocra attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access via spear-phishing and exploiting known vulnerabilities.
     - Establishing a sophisticated C&C infrastructure.
   - The question asks about the technique used for lateral movement in the local area network before the C&C infrastructure was fully established.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**
     - This technique involves purchasing technical data, which is not relevant to lateral movement or network infection.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
     - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems. This is a common method for lateral movement.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**
     - This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate and gain access to other systems. While it can be used for lateral movement, it typically requires more advanced access and is often used after initial exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
     - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While it can be used for lateral movement, it is often used in conjunction with other techniques and is not as direct as exploiting remote services.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would involve:
     1. Initial access via spear-phishing and exploiting known vulnerabilities.
     2. Lateral movement using exploitation of remote services to infect remote hosts.
     3. Establishing a sophisticated C&C infrastructure.
   - Among the given choices, **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** is the most likely technique used for lateral movement in the local area network.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
