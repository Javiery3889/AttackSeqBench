### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already used file transfers and executed arbitrary commands for data gathering. The next step in the sequence involves communication with C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a data gathering step. However, the question already mentions that data gathering has been completed, so this is not the next step in the sequence.

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with C2 infrastructure. Cloudflare Workers is a web service, so this technique aligns well with the described scenario of communicating with C2 infrastructure over Cloudflare Workers.

- **C: T1547.008-LSASS Driver**
  - This technique involves persistence through the LSASS driver, which is not related to communication with C2 infrastructure. It is more about maintaining access and persistence on the system.

- **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-layer communication, such as raw sockets or ICMP. While this could be used for C2 communication, it is less likely to be used with a web service like Cloudflare Workers, which operates at the application layer.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question states that file transfers and data gathering have already been completed.
2. The next step involves communication with C2 infrastructure over Cloudflare Workers.
3. Cloudflare Workers is a web service, so the most appropriate technique for this step is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service**
