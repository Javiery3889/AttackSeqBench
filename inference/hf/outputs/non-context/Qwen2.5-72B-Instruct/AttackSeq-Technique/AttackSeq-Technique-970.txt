### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Aria-body backdoor has already collected detailed host and network information from the victim's machine.
- The next step in the sequence is to gather data on installed software as part of the discovery phase.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred prior to the software discovery.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1090.001-Internal Proxy**: This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. It is typically used for network traffic manipulation and not for discovery of host or software information.
- **T1069.003-Cloud Groups**: This technique involves enumerating cloud groups and roles. It is specific to cloud environments and not typically used for discovering software on a local host.
- **T1518-Software Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about installed software on a system. This is directly related to the next step in the sequence described in the question.
- **T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen. It is used for visual reconnaissance and not for discovering software.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the Aria-body backdoor has already collected detailed host and network information.
- The next step is to gather data on installed software, which is part of the discovery phase.
- Among the given choices, **T1518-Software Discovery** is the most relevant and logical technique that would occur prior to gathering data on installed software.

**Final Answer: C: T1518-Software Discovery**
