### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an AutoIt downloader uses WMI objects to perform reconnaissance and gather process lists during victim system discovery.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique logically follows this sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** AutoIt downloader uses WMI objects for reconnaissance and gathering process lists.
   - **Next TTP:** We need to identify what the attacker is likely to do next after gathering this information.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices connected to the system, such as USB drives, printers, and other external devices.
     - While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after gathering process lists.
   - **B: T1547.015-Login Items**
     - This technique involves modifying login items to maintain persistence by ensuring that malicious code runs when a user logs in.
     - This is a persistence technique and is typically used after the initial reconnaissance and system information gathering.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the system, such as the operating system version, installed software, and system configuration.
     - This is a logical next step after gathering process lists, as the attacker would want to understand the system environment in more detail.
   - **D: T1593-Search Open Websites/Domains**
     - This technique involves searching for open websites or domains to gather information about the victim's network or to find potential targets.
     - This is more relevant to network reconnaissance and is less likely to follow the gathering of process lists on a single system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial step involves using WMI objects to gather process lists, which is a form of reconnaissance.
   - After gathering process lists, the attacker would likely want to gather more detailed information about the system to understand its configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery** is the most logical next step because it provides the attacker with a comprehensive understanding of the system, which is essential for planning further actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery
