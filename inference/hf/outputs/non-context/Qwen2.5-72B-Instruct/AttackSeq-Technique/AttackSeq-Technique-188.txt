### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the netd component of Infamous Chisel:
1. Automatically collected files from the local system and data directories.
2. Enumerated multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence of actions:

- **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - This technique involves identifying cloud service accounts. It does not align with the described actions of collecting files and enumerating data directories.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, credentials, and other sensitive information. It does not align with the described actions of collecting files and enumerating data directories.

- **C: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
  - This technique involves modifying a network provider DLL to capture credentials. It does not align with the described actions of collecting files and enumerating data directories.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, hardware, and software configurations. This aligns well with the described actions of enumerating data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The netd component of Infamous Chisel collected files from the local system and data directories.
2. It also enumerated multiple data directories to collect GPS and hardware information.
3. The technique that best aligns with collecting system information, including hardware details, is T1082-System Information Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
