### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers have already gained execution through DLL side-loading techniques and are about to create persistence mechanisms using a Service + Run Key.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **DLL Side-Loading**: A technique where attackers place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate program.
  - **Service + Run Key**: A persistence mechanism where the attacker creates a service and a registry run key to ensure the malware runs at system startup.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: Phishing involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code through deceptive emails, links, or attachments.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is typically used as an initial access vector, not as a step between gaining execution and creating persistence. It is less likely to be the technique used to implant the PlugX RAT after DLL side-loading.

- **Answer Choice B: T1134.002-Create Process with Token**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating a new process with a token that has elevated privileges.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to escalate privileges, it is not typically used to implant malware like PlugX RAT. It is more about gaining higher-level access rather than deploying the malware.

- **Answer Choice C: T1078.003-Local Accounts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using existing local accounts to gain access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: Using local accounts is a method for gaining initial access or moving laterally within a network. It is not directly related to the implantation of the PlugX RAT after gaining execution through DLL side-loading.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware runs automatically at system boot or user logon.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is closely related to creating persistence mechanisms, which is the next step in the attack sequence described. However, it is not the step that implants the PlugX RAT.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question asks for the technique that most likely allowed the attackers to implant the PlugX RAT after gaining execution through DLL side-loading and before creating persistence mechanisms.
  - DLL side-loading is a method to execute malicious code, but it does not directly implant the RAT.
  - The most plausible technique for implanting the PlugX RAT in this context is **T1134.002-Create Process with Token**. This technique can be used to create a new process with elevated privileges, which is necessary to install and run the PlugX RAT on the system.
  - While T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is related to persistence, it is not the step that implants the RAT.

**Final Answer: B: T1134.002-Create Process with Token**
