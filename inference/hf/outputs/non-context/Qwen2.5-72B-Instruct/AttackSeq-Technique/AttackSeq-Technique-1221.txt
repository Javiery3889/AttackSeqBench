### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10. The sequence includes:
1. Proprietary data is compressed using WinRAR.
2. Data is extracted from Dropbox using cURL for Windows.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the data was compressed using WinRAR but before it was extracted from Dropbox.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories such as databases, file shares, and other data storage systems. This is typically an earlier step in the attack chain, before data is compressed and exfiltrated.

- **B: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to gain access to a system. This is generally used for initial access or lateral movement, not for data exfiltration.

- **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
  - This technique involves collecting data from cloud storage services. This aligns well with the scenario where data is extracted from Dropbox, which is a cloud storage service. This step would logically follow the compression of data.

- **D: T1614.001-System Language Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering the language settings of the system. This is typically used for reconnaissance and is not directly related to data exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Compression**: The data is compressed using WinRAR.
2. **Data Collection from Cloud Storage**: The compressed data is then collected from a cloud storage service (Dropbox) using cURL for Windows.

Given the sequence, the most logical step after compressing the data and before extracting it from Dropbox is to collect the data from the cloud storage service.

**Final Answer: C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage**
