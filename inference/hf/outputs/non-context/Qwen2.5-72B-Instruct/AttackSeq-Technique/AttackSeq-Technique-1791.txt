### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the OceanLotus Group:
1. Leveraged lateral movement with stolen credentials.
2. Maintained Command and Control (C2) communication.
3. Exfiltrated data via a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

- **A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - Protocol tunneling involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls. While this can be used for C2 communication, it is not specifically related to maintaining C2 after lateral movement with stolen credentials.

- **B: T1650-Acquire Access**
  - Acquire Access involves gaining initial access to a system. This is not relevant to maintaining C2 communication after lateral movement.

- **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a crucial step in lateral movement. However, it does not directly facilitate maintaining C2 communication.

- **D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
  - Web Protocols involve using common web protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 communication. This is a common method for maintaining C2 after gaining access to a system, including after lateral movement.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Lateral Movement with Stolen Credentials (T1555-Credentials from Password Stores)**: The OceanLotus Group likely used stolen credentials to move laterally within the network.
2. **Maintaining C2 Communication (T1071.001-Web Protocols)**: After gaining access to the target system, the group would need to maintain C2 communication. Using web protocols is a common and effective method for this purpose.
3. **Exfiltration via Backdoor Macro**: Once C2 communication is established, the group can use a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: D: T1071.001-Web Protocols**
