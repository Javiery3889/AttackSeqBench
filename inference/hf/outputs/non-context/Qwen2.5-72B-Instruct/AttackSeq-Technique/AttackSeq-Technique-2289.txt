### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Regin malware. Specifically, it mentions that Regin gathered information on processes and memory utilization and monitored network traffic for IIS web servers. The question asks which technique most likely occurred after these initial steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary system. While this can be used to maintain persistence and evade detection, it is not directly related to the initial steps of gathering process and memory information or monitoring network traffic.

- **B: T1112-Modify Registry**
  - This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to maintain persistence or alter system behavior. While this is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not directly related to the initial steps of gathering process and memory information or monitoring network traffic.

- **C: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. This is a common technique used after gaining access to a system and understanding its environment, but it is not directly related to the initial steps of gathering process and memory information or monitoring network traffic.

- **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering system network connections to understand the network topology and identify potential targets. This is a logical next step after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and monitoring network traffic, as it helps the attacker to map out the network and identify additional targets for further exploitation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Steps**: Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization and monitors network traffic for IIS web servers.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After understanding the system and network environment, the attacker would likely want to discover system network connections to map out the network and identify additional targets.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1090-Proxy** - Not directly related to the initial steps.
   - **B: T1112-Modify Registry** - Not directly related to the initial steps.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture** - Not directly related to the initial steps.
   - **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery** - Directly related and a logical next step.

**Final Answer: D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
