### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Machete has already collected and staged encrypted logs and files in a temporary directory.
   - The next step in the sequence involves communication with remote C&C servers over FTP and HTTP ports.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Collection and staging of data.
   - Communication with C&C servers using specific protocols (FTP and HTTP).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying and enumerating peripheral devices. It is not relevant to the communication with C&C servers over FTP and HTTP.
   - **B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it suitable for exfiltration. While it might be used in the process of preparing data for exfiltration, it does not directly facilitate communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to run malicious code. It is not relevant to the communication with C&C servers over FTP and HTTP.
   - **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (such as FTP and HTTP) to communicate with C&C servers. This is directly relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the communication with C&C servers is over FTP and HTTP ports.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that involves using these protocols for communication.
   - The other techniques (T1120, T1132, T1610) do not directly relate to the communication with C&C servers over FTP and HTTP.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
