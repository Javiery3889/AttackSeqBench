### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Before the Tuyul botnet executed commands on victim systems through functionalities like 'shell' and 'perl,' which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
  - B: T1133-External Remote Services
  - C: T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call
  - D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**:
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. This is a common initial access vector for many botnets and malware.
- **T1133-External Remote Services**:
  - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to gain access to a system. While this can be a method of initial access, it typically requires prior knowledge of credentials or vulnerabilities in the service.
- **T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**:
  - This is a method of process injection used to execute arbitrary code in the context of another process. It is more commonly used for persistence and privilege escalation rather than initial access.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**:
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands on a system. While this is a common technique for executing commands, it typically follows initial access rather than enabling it.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred to enable access to the vulnerable systems before the botnet executed commands.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is the most plausible initial access technique because it involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
2. **Other Techniques**:
   - **T1133-External Remote Services** could be a method of initial access but is less likely without prior knowledge or vulnerabilities.
   - **T1055.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call** and **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** are more likely to be used after initial access has been gained.

### Final Answer: A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
