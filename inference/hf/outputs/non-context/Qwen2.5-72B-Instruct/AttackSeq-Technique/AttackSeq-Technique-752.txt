### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the 'NewPass' implant is executed using a dropper with an exported function 'LocalDataVer'.
   - The implant then communicates with the command-and-control (C2) server using a stealthy POST request mechanism.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the implant began communicating with the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. While this could be part of the initial setup, it doesn't directly relate to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: T1543.003-Windows Service**
     - This sub-technique involves creating or modifying Windows services to achieve persistence. Similar to A, this is more about maintaining the presence of the implant rather than communication.
   - **C: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking**
     - This technique involves manipulating the search order for executable files to execute malicious code. This could be used to ensure the dropper or the implant is executed, but it doesn't directly relate to communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control. This is the most relevant technique because it directly relates to the communication with the C2 server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the implant is communicating with the C2 server using a stealthy POST request mechanism. This communication is a form of exfiltration, which is covered by T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) are more about the initial setup and persistence of the implant, but they do not directly address the communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
