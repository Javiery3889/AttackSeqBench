### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by UNC2452.
   - The sequence starts with Discovery techniques like Process Discovery (T1057) and Query Registry (T1012).
   - The sequence ends with maintaining Command and Control (C2) communication using Application Layer Protocols (T1071) and Dynamic Resolution (T1112).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique is mentioned as part of the C2 communication, which is the final step in the sequence. Therefore, it cannot be the technique that occurs between the Discovery and C2 stages.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**
     - Masquerading involves making a file or program appear legitimate or benign to avoid detection. This technique is often used after initial access and discovery to maintain persistence and avoid detection. It fits well between the Discovery and C2 stages.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1505.001-SQL Stored Procedures**
     - This technique involves using SQL stored procedures to execute arbitrary code. While it can be used for various purposes, it is not typically a common step between Discovery and C2 communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1134.002-Create Process with Token**
     - This technique involves creating a new process with a specific token, which is often used for privilege escalation. While it can be used after Discovery, it is not as commonly associated with the transition to C2 communication as Masquerading.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible technique that occurs after Discovery and before C2 communication is Masquerading (T1036).

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
