### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT-TOCS:
1. Evaded detection by executing malicious code in memory without any hard disk activity.
2. Ran multi-beacon communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

- **A: T1106-Native API**
  - **Description**: T1106 involves directly interacting with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute actions.
  - **Relevance**: This technique can be used to execute code in memory, which aligns with the first part of the sequence (evading detection by executing malicious code in memory).

- **B: T1059.009-Cloud API**
  - **Description**: T1059.009 involves using cloud-based APIs to execute commands or scripts.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about leveraging cloud services, which does not directly align with executing code in memory or evading detection.

- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - **Description**: T1190 involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about gaining initial access, which typically occurs before the described evasion and communication techniques. However, it does not directly align with the specific sequence of executing code in memory and running multi-beacon communication.

- **D: T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes**
  - **Description**: T1564.004 involves modifying NTFS file attributes to hide files or directories.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is about hiding files on the disk, which does not align with executing code in memory without hard disk activity.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **T1106-Native API** is the most relevant technique because it can be used to execute code in memory, which is a key part of the described evasion technique.
2. **T1059.009-Cloud API** and **T1564.004-NTFS File Attributes** do not align well with the described sequence.
3. **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application** is about gaining initial access, which is a prerequisite but not directly part of the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: T1106-Native API**
