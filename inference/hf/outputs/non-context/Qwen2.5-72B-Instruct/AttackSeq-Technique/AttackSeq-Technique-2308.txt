### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary first attempts to clean up traces of their intrusions (e.g., clearing Windows event logs) and then uses PsLogList for discovery.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Cleaning up traces**: This is likely related to **T1070 - Indicator Removal**.
  - **Using PsLogList for discovery**: This is likely related to **T1082 - System Information Discovery** or **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1548.005 - Temporary Elevated Cloud Access**
  - This technique involves temporarily elevating privileges in cloud environments, which is not directly related to cleaning up traces or using PsLogList for discovery.
- **Answer Choice B: T1134.001 - Token Impersonation/Theft**
  - This technique involves stealing or impersonating tokens to gain higher privileges, which is not directly related to cleaning up traces or using PsLogList for discovery.
- **Answer Choice C: T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access, which is not directly related to cleaning up traces or using PsLogList for discovery.
- **Answer Choice D: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which aligns with the described action of cleaning up traces (e.g., clearing Windows event logs).

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The sequence described in the question involves the adversary first cleaning up traces of their intrusions, which is a common post-exploitation activity to avoid detection.
  - The technique **T1070 - Indicator Removal** is the most appropriate choice for this step, as it directly involves actions like clearing event logs.
  - After cleaning up traces, the adversary then uses PsLogList for discovery, which is a logical next step to gather more information about the system.

**Final Answer: D: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
