### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Agrius:
1. Exploited FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 to upload webshells.
2. Used the webshells for lateral movement.
3. Achieved persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the persistence step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1564.012-File/Path Exclusions**
  - This technique involves manipulating file or path exclusions to prevent security software from scanning or monitoring specific files or directories. This is not directly related to the steps described in the question, which focus on exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While this could be used during the attack, it is not a necessary step before achieving persistence by registering a backdoor as a service.

- **C: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**
  - This technique involves using the command-line interface (CLI) of network devices to execute commands. This is not directly related to the steps described in the question, which focus on webshells and service registration.

- **D: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. This aligns well with the described step of registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service, which is a method of achieving persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exploitation and Webshell Upload**: Agrius exploited FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 to upload webshells.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The webshells were used for lateral movement.
3. **Persistence**: To achieve persistence, Agrius registered the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service.

The technique that most likely occurred before achieving persistence by registering the backdoor as a service is **T1569-System Services**. This technique involves creating or modifying system services, which is exactly what is described in the question.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
