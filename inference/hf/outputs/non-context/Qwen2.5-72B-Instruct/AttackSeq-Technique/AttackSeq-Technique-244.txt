### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where ShadowTech RAT is deployed via a malicious executable during Initial Access.
   - The malware then ensures persistence by adding a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is deployed via a malicious executable.
   - **Persistence:** The malware adds a registry key to ensure it runs at logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
     - This technique involves adversaries transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
     - This is not directly related to persistence or the registry key modification.
   - **B: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
     - This technique is specific to Linux systems and involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks.
     - This is not relevant to the Windows registry key modification.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves adversaries configuring a system to execute their tools or malware at boot or logon.
     - Adding a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` is a common method to achieve this.
   - **D: T1137.006-Add-ins**
     - This technique involves adversaries using add-ins to load malicious code into applications.
     - This is not related to the registry key modification for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifies that the malware ensures persistence by adding a registry key.
   - The registry key is added under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`, which is a known method for achieving persistence at logon.
   - The technique that best matches this behavior is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
