### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT15. The sequence is as follows:
1. APT15 obtained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
2. APT15 then achieved persistence by installing the RoyalDNS backdoor.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1213 - Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories such as databases, file shares, and other data storage systems. This is typically done after gaining access and establishing persistence, not immediately after obtaining credentials.

- **B: T1078 - Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. Since APT15 already obtained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, they would use these valid accounts to perform further actions, including installing the backdoor.

- **C: T1546.008 - Accessibility Features**
  - This technique involves using accessibility features to maintain persistence. While this could be a method for persistence, it is not the most likely immediate step after obtaining credentials.

- **D: T1606 - Forge Web Credentials**
  - This technique involves creating fake web credentials, which is not relevant to the sequence described. It is more related to web-based attacks and phishing.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Obtaining Credentials**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
2. **Using Valid Accounts**: After obtaining the credentials, the most logical next step is to use these valid accounts to perform further actions.
3. **Installing Backdoor**: Using the valid accounts, APT15 then installed the RoyalDNS backdoor to achieve persistence.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials and before installing the backdoor is **T1078 - Valid Accounts**.

**Final Answer: B: T1078 - Valid Accounts**
