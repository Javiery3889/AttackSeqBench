### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the CopyKittens attack group. Specifically, it mentions the use of a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection in their multi-stage infection framework. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after these initial steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1070.007 - Clear Network Connection History and Configurations**
  - This technique involves removing or altering network connection history and configurations to hide the attacker's activities. While this can be part of post-compromise activities, it is not directly related to the initial steps of preventing detection.

- **B: T1001 - Data Obfuscation**
  - This technique involves altering data to make it harder to understand. This can be used to prevent detection by making the data less recognizable to security tools. This is a plausible next step after using a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection.

- **C: T1547.012 - Print Processors**
  - This technique involves modifying print processors to maintain persistence. This is not directly related to the initial steps of preventing detection and is more about maintaining long-term access.

- **D: T1622 - Debugger Evasion**
  - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers, which can be used to prevent detection and analysis of the malware. This is a plausible next step after using a global mutex and runtime API address resolution to prevent detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Steps:**
  - **Global Mutex:** Used to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time, preventing multiple instances from conflicting and making detection more difficult.
  - **Runtime API Address Resolution:** Used to dynamically resolve API addresses at runtime, making static analysis more difficult and evading signature-based detection.

- **Next Steps:**
  - **Data Obfuscation (T1001):** This can be used to further obfuscate the data and make it harder for security tools to understand the malware's activities.
  - **Debugger Evasion (T1622):** This can be used to detect and evade debuggers, making it harder for security researchers to analyze the malware.

Both **Data Obfuscation (T1001)** and **Debugger Evasion (T1622)** are plausible next steps, but **Debugger Evasion (T1622)** is more directly related to the initial steps of preventing detection by making the malware harder to analyze.

### Final Answer: D: T1622 - Debugger Evasion
