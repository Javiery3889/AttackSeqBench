### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - **Reconnaissance:** The attacker uses spear phishing emails to gather information.
     - **Evaluation:** The attacker evaluates the software installed on the victim's computer by sending GET requests to third-party websites.
     - **Objective:** The goal is to gain access to the victim's device.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1078.002-Domain Accounts**
     - This technique involves using legitimate domain accounts to gain access to a network. It does not align with the initial reconnaissance and evaluation steps described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gather information from the victim. While it aligns with the reconnaissance phase, it does not directly lead to gaining access to the victim's device.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a victim's device. It aligns with the use of spear phishing emails and the subsequent evaluation of the victim's software, which is a common step before exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1123-Audio Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing audio from the victim's device. It is not relevant to the initial reconnaissance and evaluation steps described in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using spear phishing emails to gather information and evaluate the victim's software, which is a common precursor to gaining access to the victim's device.
   - The most plausible technique that fits this sequence is **T1566-Phishing** because it directly involves using phishing to gain initial access, which is the next logical step after reconnaissance and evaluation.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
