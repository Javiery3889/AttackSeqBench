### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where a Linux Turla sample intercepted incoming packets without root access and executed commands via `/bin/sh -c`.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Intercepting incoming packets without root access**: This suggests the use of a technique to gain network-level access or manipulate network traffic.
  - **Executing commands via `/bin/sh -c`**: This indicates the use of a command-line interpreter to execute commands.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1574.007-Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves manipulating the PATH environment variable to execute a different program than intended. It is not directly related to intercepting network packets or executing commands via a shell.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a strong fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. It is not directly related to the initial steps of intercepting packets or executing commands.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a strong fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1053.003-Cron**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves scheduling tasks to run at specific times using cron jobs. It is not directly related to the initial steps of intercepting packets or executing commands.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a strong fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripting languages to execute commands. The use of `/bin/sh -c` to execute commands aligns directly with this technique.
  - **Evaluation**: This is the most plausible choice as it directly matches the described action of executing commands via a shell.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Intercepting incoming packets without root access** suggests a network-level manipulation.
2. **Executing commands via `/bin/sh -c`** indicates the use of a command-line interpreter.
3. **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** is the technique that directly matches the use of a shell to execute commands.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
