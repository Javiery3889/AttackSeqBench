### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a dropper uses an OLE package to decode and execute shellcode from the CVE-2017-11882 exploit for Initial Access.
   - After the initial access, the dropper creates and loads files such as iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll for subsequent execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The dropper uses an OLE package to exploit CVE-2017-11882.
   - **Subsequent Action:** The dropper creates and loads files for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
     - While this could be used to execute the files, it doesn't specifically address the creation and loading of files.
   - **B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application.
     - This is relevant to the initial access but not to the creation and loading of files.
   - **C: T1059.001-PowerShell:**
     - This is a sub-technique of T1059 and involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts.
     - Similar to T1059, it doesn't specifically address the creation and loading of files.
   - **D: T1543.001-Launch Agent:**
     - This technique involves creating or modifying system startup configuration to achieve persistence.
     - This is the most relevant technique because it involves creating and loading files that are executed at system startup or during specific events.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access:**
   - The dropper uses an OLE package to exploit CVE-2017-11882, which is an initial access technique.
2. **Subsequent Action:**
   - The dropper creates and loads files such as iassvcs.exe, sqlite3.dll, and RasTls.dll.
   - This action is more aligned with creating or modifying system startup configurations to ensure the files are executed, which is a persistence technique.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1543.001-Launch Agent
