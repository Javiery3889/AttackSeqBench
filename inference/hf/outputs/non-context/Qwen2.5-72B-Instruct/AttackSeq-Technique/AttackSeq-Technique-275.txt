### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker uses a vulnerability exploit to execute an embedded .hta file via `mshta.exe`. The next step in the attack sequence involves maintaining the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs**
  - This technique involves clearing or modifying log files to hide the attacker's actions. While this is a common post-exploitation technique, it does not directly relate to maintaining the presence of the Trojan by automatically executing files at regular intervals.

- **B: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at regular intervals. This aligns well with the described need to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by ensuring it runs periodically.

- **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While this is a common technique for exfiltration and C2 communication, it does not directly relate to maintaining the presence of the Trojan by automatic execution.

- **D: T1546.001 - Change Default File Association**
  - This technique involves changing the default file association for certain file types to execute malicious code when a user opens a file. While this can be used to maintain persistence, it is less common and less direct compared to using scheduled tasks.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes the need to maintain the presence of the Helminth Trojan agent by automatically executing files at regular intervals.
- Among the given choices, **T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job** is the most appropriate technique for this purpose.
- Scheduled tasks are a common and effective method for ensuring that malicious code runs periodically, which aligns with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job**
