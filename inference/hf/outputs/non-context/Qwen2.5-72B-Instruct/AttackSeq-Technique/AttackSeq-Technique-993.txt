### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The attacker gained initial access through a phishing email.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - A VBS script was used to drop a JavaScript backdoor.
  - The malware executed an obfuscated script.
  - A DLL file was loaded in memory.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the execution of an obfuscated script or loading a DLL in memory.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564.008 - Email Hiding Rules**
  - This technique involves using email rules to hide or redirect emails, which is not relevant to the execution of an obfuscated script or loading a DLL in memory.

- **Answer Choice C: T1129 - Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules, such as DLLs, to execute code. This aligns well with the described action of loading a DLL file in memory.

- **Answer Choice D: T1559.001 - Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code or perform actions. While this could be relevant, it is not as directly related to the specific action of loading a DLL in memory as T1129.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the execution of an obfuscated script and the loading of a DLL file in memory.
  - T1129 (Shared Modules) is the most relevant technique because it specifically involves using shared libraries or modules, such as DLLs, to execute code.
  - The other techniques (T1071, T1564.008, and T1559.001) do not directly address the specific action of loading a DLL in memory.

**Final Answer: C: T1129 - Shared Modules**
