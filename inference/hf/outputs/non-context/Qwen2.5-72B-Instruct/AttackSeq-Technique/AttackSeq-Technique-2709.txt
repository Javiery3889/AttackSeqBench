### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aurora malware:
1. Achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names.
2. Modified registry keys.
3. Evaded detection by modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, file extensions, or other artifacts to avoid detection. Modifying file-times to match system DLLs is a form of hiding artifacts to evade detection.
  - **Relevance:** High. This technique fits the description of modifying file-times to match system DLLs.

- **B: T1055.012-Process Hollowing**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious code into a legitimate process by creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process.
  - **Relevance:** Low. This technique does not involve modifying file-times or registry keys.

- **C: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. The malware installed itself as a service under random names, which aligns with this technique.
  - **Relevance:** High. This technique fits the description of installing itself as a service.

- **D: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect or understand. It typically involves encoding, encrypting, or otherwise obfuscating data.
  - **Relevance:** Low. This technique does not involve modifying file-times or registry keys.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names and modifying registry keys. This aligns with **T1569-System Services**.
2. To evade detection, the malware modified the file-time of the dropped DLL to match an existing system DLL. This aligns with **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible technique for the final step of evading detection by modifying file-times is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
