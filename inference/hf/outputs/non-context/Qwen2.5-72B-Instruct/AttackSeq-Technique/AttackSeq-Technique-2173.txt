### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where attackers sent spear phishing emails that exploited Microsoft Word features for reconnaissance.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, such as IP addresses, operating system, and installed software. This is typically done after gaining some level of access to the victim's system, not before.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending phishing emails to victims to gain initial access. The question already mentions that the attackers sent spear phishing emails, so this is a part of the attack sequence but not the step before gaining initial access.

- **Answer Choice C: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as network topology, IP addresses, and network services. Similar to T1592, this is typically done after gaining some level of access to the victim's system, not before.

- **Answer Choice D: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials to gain access to systems. This is typically used after the initial access has been gained, not before.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question states that the attackers sent spear phishing emails to gain initial access. The step before gaining initial access through the victim opening the OLE2 format attachments would be the actual phishing activity itself.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first sent the phishing emails (T1566) to the victim, and then the victim opened the OLE2 format attachments, leading to initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
