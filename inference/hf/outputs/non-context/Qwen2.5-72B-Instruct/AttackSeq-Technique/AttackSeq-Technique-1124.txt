### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware has been concealed using defense evasion techniques such as hiding files with attributes and using a sophisticated installer.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with a command and control (C2) server at a specific IP address (160.20.147.254).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1001.003 - Protocol or Service Impersonation:**
     - This technique involves impersonating legitimate protocols or services to avoid detection. While it can be used for communication, it is more about mimicking legitimate traffic rather than establishing a new communication channel.
   - **B: T1129 - Shared Modules:**
     - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to load malicious code. It is more about loading and executing code rather than establishing communication.
   - **C: T1505.002 - Transport Agent:**
     - This technique involves using transport agents to intercept and modify email traffic. It is specific to email systems and not generally used for establishing C2 communication.
   - **D: T1571 - Non-Standard Port:**
     - This technique involves using non-standard ports to establish communication. It is a common method for evading detection by firewalls and other network security measures, making it a plausible choice for establishing C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of establishing communication with a C2 server and the need to evade detection, the most plausible technique is using a non-standard port to establish the communication channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1571 - Non-Standard Port**
