### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where a BlackEnergy dropper executes "vba_macro.exe" using a macro-enabled Word document.
- The macro builds strings and runs them in memory.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial execution.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This is typically used to maintain persistence but is not the immediate next step after running a macro in memory.
- **T1092-Communication Through Removable Media**: This technique involves using removable media to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is not a common immediate next step after running a macro in memory.
- **T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into a legitimate process using Image File Execution Options (IFEO). This can be used to maintain persistence or to execute additional payloads, which is a plausible next step after running a macro in memory.
- **T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using non-standard protocols to communicate with a C2 server. This is not typically an immediate next step after running a macro in memory.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The BlackEnergy dropper uses a macro-enabled Word document to execute "vba_macro.exe" and run strings in memory.
2. **Next Steps**: After the initial execution, the attacker would likely want to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads.
3. **Persistence Mechanism**: T1546.012 (Image File Execution Options Injection) is a common technique for maintaining persistence by injecting code into a legitimate process.
4. **Other Techniques**: The other techniques (T1547, T1092, T1095) are less likely to be the immediate next step after running a macro in memory.

### Final Answer: C: T1546.012-Image File Execution Options Injection
