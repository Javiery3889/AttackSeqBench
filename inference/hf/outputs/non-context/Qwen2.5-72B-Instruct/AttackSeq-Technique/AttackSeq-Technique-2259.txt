### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes the initial stages of an attack by the SideCopy APT group. Specifically, it mentions that they used malicious LNK files as entry points and tailored their campaigns to target government and military personnel by aligning their themes and decoys with operational documents and military contexts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1591 - Gather Victim Org Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the target organization, which can include details about the organization's structure, personnel, and operational documents. This information can be used to tailor phishing campaigns and make them more convincing. This aligns well with the described scenario where the attackers tailored their campaigns to target government and military personnel.

- **B: T1555 - Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is typically used after gaining initial access to a system. It does not align with the initial stage of gathering information to tailor the campaign.

- **C: T1595.001 - Scanning IP Blocks**
  - This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While this can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more about identifying potential targets rather than gathering specific information to tailor a campaign.

- **D: T1547.002 - Authentication Package**
  - This technique involves modifying the authentication process, which is typically used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. It does not align with the initial stage of gathering information to tailor a campaign.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the initial stages of an attack where the attackers tailored their campaigns to target specific personnel.
2. Tailoring campaigns requires specific information about the target organization and its personnel.
3. The technique that best fits this requirement is T1591 - Gather Victim Org Information, as it involves collecting the necessary information to make the campaign more convincing and targeted.

**Final Answer: A: T1591 - Gather Victim Org Information**
