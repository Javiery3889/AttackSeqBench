### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where initial access to target systems was achieved via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros.
- **Key TTPs**: The question asks about the technique used for gathering information about potential victims before the initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1565-Data Manipulation**
  - **Description**: This technique involves altering data to achieve a specific goal, such as making the data appear legitimate or to evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used for gathering information about potential victims. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities.

- **Answer Choice B: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves the use of digital certificates to establish trust and secure communications.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not related to gathering information about potential victims. It is more relevant to establishing secure connections or masquerading as a trusted entity.

- **Answer Choice C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information from potential victims, such as login credentials, personal information, or other sensitive data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the question. Phishing for information is a common method used to gather data about potential victims before launching a more targeted attack.

- **Answer Choice D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
  - **Description**: This technique involves searching publicly available technical databases to gather information about potential victims.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is also relevant to gathering information about potential victims. However, it is more passive and less direct compared to phishing for information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - **T1565-Data Manipulation** and **T1596.003-Digital Certificates** are not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.
  - **T1598-Phishing for Information** is a direct and common method for gathering information about potential victims, making it the most plausible choice.
  - **T1596-Search Open Technical Databases** is also relevant but less direct and less likely to be the primary method used in this context.

**Final Answer: C: T1598-Phishing for Information**
