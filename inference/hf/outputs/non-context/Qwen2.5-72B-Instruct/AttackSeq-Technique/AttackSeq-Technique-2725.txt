### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where a custom tunneling tool was used for data exfiltration, and it asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to enable communication between the organization's corporate and restricted network segments by leveraging a compromised router.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1070.006-Timestomp**
  - **Description**: Timestomp is a technique used to modify the timestamps of files to make them appear as if they were created or modified at a different time. This is typically used to evade detection and forensic analysis.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to enabling communication between network segments. It is more about obfuscation and evasion.

- **B: T1090-Proxy**
  - **Description**: Proxy is a technique where an adversary uses a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic. This can be used to communicate between different network segments.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the scenario described. A compromised router can be used as a proxy to enable communication between the corporate and restricted network segments.

- **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the network configuration, such as IP addresses, routing tables, and network interfaces.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for reconnaissance, it does not directly enable communication between network segments. It is more about gathering information.

- **D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application-layer communication, such as ICMP or DNS, to exfiltrate data or communicate between systems.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is relevant to data exfiltration but not specifically to enabling communication between network segments using a compromised router.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions the use of a custom tunneling tool for data exfiltration and the need to enable communication between network segments.
  - The most relevant technique for enabling communication between network segments by leveraging a compromised router is **T1090-Proxy**.
  - The other techniques (T1070.006-Timestomp, T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery, and T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol) do not directly address the need to enable communication between network segments.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
