### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the threat actor, Earth Wendigo, is intercepting HTTPS POST requests to a webmail login API to steal username and password pairs. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed Earth Wendigo to evade detection by using indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves altering the appearance of code or data to make it harder to understand. While this can help evade detection, it doesn't specifically relate to indirect script execution through the webmail system's features.

- **B: T1564 - Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network artifacts to avoid detection. This could be relevant if the attacker is trying to hide the presence of their scripts, but it doesn't directly address indirect script execution.

- **C: T1491 - Defacement**
  - This technique involves altering the content of a website or web application to display unauthorized content. This is not relevant to the described scenario of intercepting HTTPS POST requests.

- **D: T1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - This technique involves using alternative protocols to exfiltrate data. While this could be used after stealing the credentials, it doesn't address the evasion technique used to intercept the requests in the first place.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically mentions "indirect script execution through the webmail system's features" to evade detection. This suggests that the attacker is using the webmail system's legitimate features to execute their malicious scripts without being detected.
  - Among the given choices, **T1564 - Hide Artifacts** is the most relevant because it can involve using legitimate system features to hide the presence of malicious scripts. For example, the attacker might use the webmail system's scripting capabilities to execute their code in a way that blends in with normal traffic and avoids detection.

- **Final Answer: B: T1564 - Hide Artifacts**
