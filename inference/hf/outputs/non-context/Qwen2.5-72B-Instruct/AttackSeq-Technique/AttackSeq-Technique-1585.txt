### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where T9000 malware has already collected and captured sensitive data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves the malware communicating with its C2 server using encrypted traffic while navigating through environments with web proxies.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy**
  - T1090-Proxy involves the use of a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server. This technique is often used to bypass network security measures, such as web proxies, and to obfuscate the true destination of the traffic.
  - This aligns well with the requirement to communicate with the C2 server while navigating through environments with web proxies.

- **Answer Choice B: T1555.001-Keychain**
  - T1555.001-Keychain involves stealing credentials from the macOS Keychain. This technique is more about credential theft and does not directly relate to communication with a C2 server or navigating through web proxies.

- **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - T1119-Automated Collection involves the use of automated tools to collect data from the victim's system. This technique is more about the data collection phase, which has already been described as completed in the question.

- **Answer Choice D: T1001.001-Junk Data**
  - T1001.001-Junk Data involves adding junk data to the payload to obfuscate the true content. While this can be used to evade detection, it does not directly address the need to communicate with a C2 server through web proxies.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions the need to communicate with a C2 server using encrypted traffic while navigating through environments with web proxies.
- T1090-Proxy is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves routing traffic through an intermediary server to bypass network security measures and obfuscate the true destination of the traffic.

**Final Answer: A: T1090-Proxy**
