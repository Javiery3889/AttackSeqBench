### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After CosmicDuke collects sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers, which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitates the transfer of this information to remote servers?
- **TTPs Mentioned**: 
  - Collection of sensitive information using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
  - Transfer of collected information to remote servers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
  - This technique involves collecting data from removable media such as USB drives. It does not align with the scenario of transferring data to remote servers.

- **Answer Choice B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network topology. It is not related to the transfer of collected sensitive information to remote servers.

- **Answer Choice C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - This technique involves the automated transfer of collected data to a remote server. It aligns well with the scenario where CosmicDuke uses tools to collect sensitive information and then transfers it to remote servers.

- **Answer Choice D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using web services, such as HTTP or HTTPS. It is a specific method of exfiltration and could be a plausible choice, but it is more specific than the general automated exfiltration technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the collection of sensitive information using various tools and the subsequent transfer of this information to remote servers.
  - **T1025-Data from Removable Media** and **T1590-Gather Victim Network Information** do not fit the scenario of transferring collected data to remote servers.
  - **T1020-Automated Exfiltration** is a general technique that fits the scenario well, as it involves the automated transfer of collected data to a remote server.
  - **T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service** is a specific method of exfiltration, but it is not as broad as the general automated exfiltration technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
