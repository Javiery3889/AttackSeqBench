### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before 'Surtr' connects to a command and control (C2) server and downloads a stage two component to a specific directory. This implies that we are looking for a technique that typically precedes the C2 communication and the download of additional components.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions, such as clicking on a link or opening an attachment. This can be a common initial access vector, but it does not directly lead to C2 communication and downloading additional components.

- **B: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - Deploying a container is a technique used to run malicious code in a containerized environment. This is more relevant to the execution phase and not typically a precursor to C2 communication and downloading additional components.

- **C: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
  - Publish/Subscribe Protocols are used for communication between different components of a system. While this can be used for C2 communication, it is not a technique that typically precedes the initial C2 connection and download of additional components.

- **D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - Multi-Stage Channels involve using multiple communication channels to establish and maintain C2. This technique is often used to ensure robust and resilient C2 communication. It is a plausible technique that could occur before the C2 connection and the download of additional components, as it sets up the necessary infrastructure for communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker needs to gain initial access to the target system. This could be through phishing (T1566), but it is not the most direct precursor to C2 communication.
2. **C2 Communication Setup**: The attacker needs to establish a C2 channel to communicate with the compromised system. Multi-Stage Channels (T1104) is a technique that sets up multiple communication channels, which is a necessary step before the actual C2 connection and downloading of additional components.
3. **Download Additional Components**: Once the C2 channel is established, the attacker can use it to download additional components to the target system.

Given this reasoning, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker sets up multi-stage channels before connecting to the C2 server and downloading additional components.

**Final Answer: D: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
