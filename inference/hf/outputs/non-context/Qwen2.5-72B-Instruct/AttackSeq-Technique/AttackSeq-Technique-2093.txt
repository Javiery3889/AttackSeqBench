### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have already moved laterally across the infrastructure and have compromised numerous workstations and internal hosts. The next step in their attack sequence involves searching for critical information.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1562.006-Indicator Blocking**
  - This technique involves preventing the detection of malicious activities by blocking indicators such as logs or alerts. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the primary focus of searching for critical information.

- **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories such as databases, file shares, and other data storage systems. This aligns well with the attackers' goal of searching for critical information after compromising internal hosts.

- **C: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, which is typically used to gain additional access or move laterally. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not the primary focus of searching for critical information.

- **D: T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing**
  - This technique involves manipulating DHCP servers to control network configurations. This is more related to network manipulation and not directly to searching for critical information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers have already moved laterally and compromised numerous workstations and internal hosts.
2. The next logical step in the attack sequence is to search for critical information.
3. Among the given choices, **T1213-Data from Information Repositories** is the most relevant technique for collecting data from information repositories, which aligns with the attackers' goal of searching for critical information.

**Final Answer: B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
