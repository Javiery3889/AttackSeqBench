### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where ShadowPad, a malware known for its persistence through remotely deployed plugins and hardcoded control interfaces, is used in a long-term espionage campaign. The focus is on enhancing anti-forensics capabilities to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described scenario:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared libraries or modules to maintain persistence or evade detection. While it can be used for persistence, it doesn't directly enhance anti-forensics capabilities.

- **B: T1600.001-Reduce Key Space**
  - This technique is related to reducing the number of possible keys in cryptographic systems, which is not directly related to anti-forensics or maintaining stealth in a long-term espionage campaign.

- **C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or other indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This is a key anti-forensics technique that would be highly relevant in a long-term espionage scenario to maintain stealth.

- **D: T1621-Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation**
  - This technique involves generating requests to bypass multi-factor authentication, which is more related to initial access or privilege escalation rather than anti-forensics.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **ShadowPad's Persistence**: The malware uses remotely deployed plugins and hardcoded control interfaces to maintain persistence.
2. **Long-Term Espionage**: The focus is on maintaining a long-term presence in the victim environment.
3. **Anti-Forensics**: The goal is to enhance anti-forensics capabilities to avoid detection and maintain stealth.

Given these points, the most relevant technique is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**. This technique directly addresses the need to hide files, system artifacts, and other indicators of compromise, which is crucial for maintaining stealth in a long-term espionage campaign.

**Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
