### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence that begins with emails impersonating Mexico's tax department. These emails contain a malicious attachment that, when downloaded, initiates the attack chain. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in this sequence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1187-Forced Authentication**
  - Forced Authentication involves an adversary attempting to force a user to authenticate to a service, which is not a typical next step after a user downloads a malicious attachment. This technique is more relevant to scenarios where the adversary is trying to gain access to a service by forcing the user to authenticate.

- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - Gathering victim identity information involves collecting information about the victim, such as names, usernames, and other personal details. This could be a plausible next step, but it is not the most immediate action after a malicious attachment is downloaded.

- **C: T1114-Email Collection**
  - Email Collection involves the adversary collecting emails from the victim's email client or server. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access through a malicious attachment, as the adversary might want to gather more information or spread the attack further.

- **D: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
  - Network Trust Dependencies involve exploiting trust relationships between networked systems. This technique is more relevant to later stages of an attack, where the adversary is trying to move laterally within the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack begins with a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department.
2. The victim downloads a malicious attachment, which initiates the attack chain.
3. The next logical step would be for the adversary to collect more information from the victim's system to understand the environment and plan further actions.
4. Among the given options, **T1114-Email Collection** is the most plausible next step, as it involves gathering emails, which can provide valuable information for the adversary to use in subsequent stages of the attack.

**Final Answer: C: T1114-Email Collection**
