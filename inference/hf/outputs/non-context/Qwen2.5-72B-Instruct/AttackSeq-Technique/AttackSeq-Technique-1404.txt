### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The attacker used CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails.
- **Persistence**: The attacker achieved persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key.
- **Next Step**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. This is a common method for establishing command and control (C2) communication after gaining initial access and persistence.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**
  - This technique involves abusing mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. While this could be relevant in the context of gaining higher privileges, it does not directly relate to communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it was used in the initial stage, the question is asking about the next step after gaining persistence.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is less common and more specific than using application layer protocols.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker used CVE-2015-2545 via spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: The attacker achieved persistence using an ActiveSetup registry key.
3. **Communication**: After gaining initial access and persistence, the attacker needs to establish communication with their infrastructure to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
4. **Most Likely Technique**: The most common and straightforward method for this communication is using application layer protocols (T1071).

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
