### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes the 'Red October' campaign, which established a foothold through executing exploits in malicious documents delivered via email.
- The focus is on the technique used to achieve initial access prior to the deployment of the main malware component.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1568-Dynamic Resolution (Answer A)**: This technique involves dynamically resolving IP addresses to domain names or vice versa. It is not typically used for initial access but rather for command and control (C2) activities.
- **T1566-Phishing (Answer B and C)**: This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick recipients into opening attachments or clicking on links, which can lead to the execution of exploits and the delivery of malware. This aligns well with the described scenario of using malicious documents delivered via email.
- **T1087.002-Domain Account (Answer D)**: This technique involves querying for information about domain accounts. It is more relevant to post-compromise activities, such as reconnaissance, rather than initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The 'Red October' campaign used malicious documents delivered via email to establish a foothold.
2. The initial access was achieved through the execution of exploits in these documents.
3. The technique that aligns with sending malicious emails to trick recipients into opening attachments is **T1566-Phishing**.
4. The other techniques (T1568-Dynamic Resolution and T1087.002-Domain Account) are not relevant to the initial access phase described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
