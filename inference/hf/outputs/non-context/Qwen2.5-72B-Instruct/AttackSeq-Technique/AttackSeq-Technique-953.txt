### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence by the Sednit group.
- The sequence includes gathering system and environmental information using discovery techniques.
- The next step involves scanning files for credential-related databases, such as those from Firefox and email clients.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input from the graphical user interface, such as keystrokes or screen captures.
  - This is not typically a step that occurs before scanning for credential-related databases. It is more focused on real-time data capture.

- **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves obtaining credentials from password stores, which can include browsers and email clients.
  - This is a logical next step after gathering system and environmental information, as the attacker would use the discovered information to locate and extract credentials.

- **Answer Choice C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves manipulating network traffic to achieve a specific goal, such as evading detection or exfiltrating data.
  - This is not directly related to the process of scanning for credential-related databases.

- **Answer Choice D: T1596-Search Open Technical Databases**
  - This technique involves searching for open technical databases, which could be relevant in a broader context but is not specifically about scanning for credential-related databases.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves:
  1. Gathering system and environmental information using discovery techniques.
  2. Scanning files for credential-related databases.
- The most logical step between these two actions is to use the discovered information to locate and extract credentials from password stores.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is **T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**.

Final Answer: B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores
