### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the RogueRobin payload is delivered, and before execution, it checks for sandbox environments using WMI queries and process enumeration.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely allowed DarkHydrus to deliver the malicious PowerShell script to the target.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is often used to trick individuals into providing sensitive information or to deliver malware.
- **T1566.002-Spearphishing Link**: This is a sub-technique of T1566-Phishing where the attacker sends a targeted message with a malicious link. The link can lead to a website that delivers the malware or directly downloads the malicious payload.
- **T1591.002-Business Relationships**: This technique involves leveraging existing business relationships to gain access to a target. It is less likely to be the initial vector for delivering a malicious script.
- **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access. It is more likely to be used after initial access has been gained, rather than as the initial delivery method.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question is asking about the initial delivery method of the malicious PowerShell script.
2. **Phishing and Spearphishing**: Both T1566-Phishing and T1566.002-Spearphishing Link are plausible methods for delivering a malicious script.
3. **Spearphishing Link**: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link is more specific and targeted, which aligns well with the sophisticated nature of the DarkHydrus group.
4. **Business Relationships**: T1591.002-Business Relationships is less likely to be the initial vector for delivering a script.
5. **Subvert Trust Controls**: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls is more likely to be used after initial access has been gained.

### Final Answer: B: T1566.002-Spearphishing Link
