### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group, which includes using stolen credentials for network scanning and collecting system information during the information-gathering phase.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Stolen Credentials**: The group has already obtained credentials.
  - **Network Scanning**: They are scanning the network.
  - **Collection of System Information**: They are gathering information about the systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1074-Data Staged**
  - **Description**: This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration by copying it to a central location or staging it for transfer.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is typically used after the attacker has already collected the data and is preparing to exfiltrate it. It does not fit well with the information-gathering phase described in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information.
  - **Evaluation**: Network sniffing can be used to gather more detailed information about network traffic, which aligns well with the information-gathering phase. However, it is not the most likely next step after network scanning and system information collection.

- **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems.
  - **Evaluation**: Since the group has already used stolen credentials for network scanning and system information collection, this technique would have been used earlier in the attack sequence, not after the information-gathering phase.

- **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves identifying file and directory paths on a system.
  - **Evaluation**: After collecting system information and scanning the network, the next logical step would be to discover specific files and directories of interest. This aligns well with the information-gathering phase and the sequence described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Stolen Credentials**: The group has already obtained and used stolen credentials.
2. **Network Scanning**: They have scanned the network to understand its structure.
3. **System Information Collection**: They have gathered information about the systems on the network.
4. **Next Logical Step**: The next step in the information-gathering phase would be to discover specific files and directories of interest.

**Final Answer: D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
