### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where NanHaiShu gathers and uploads system information to a C&C server using HTTP POST.
   - The initial communication with the C&C server involves resolving to IP addresses hosted in the United States and later switching to a Chinese IP address.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Communication with C&C Server:** The question mentions that the initial communication involves resolving to IP addresses hosted in the United States and later switching to a Chinese IP address.
   - **Gathering and Uploading System Information:** After establishing communication, NanHaiShu gathers and uploads system information to the C&C server using HTTP POST.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving the C&C server's IP address, which aligns with the described behavior of initially resolving to U.S. IP addresses and later switching to a Chinese IP address.
   - **B: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This is the same as option A, so it is also a valid choice.
   - **C: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server.
   - **D: T1056.003-Web Portal Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing credentials from web portals, which is not related to the initial communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves dynamically resolving the C&C server's IP address to establish initial communication, which is described by T1568-Dynamic Resolution.
   - Both options A and B are the same and correct, but we will choose one for the final answer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution
