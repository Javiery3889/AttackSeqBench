### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where malicious macros are used to download payloads.
   - The focus is on what happens **after** the execution of these malicious macros.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Execution Tactic:** Malicious macros are executed, which download payloads.
   - **Subsequent Activities:** We need to determine what technique is most likely to occur next.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files. However, since the question already mentions that the macros have been executed, this is not a subsequent step.
   - **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
     - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. While it can be part of an attack, it is not typically a direct next step after downloading payloads.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. This is a logical next step after downloading payloads, as the attacker would want to ensure persistence.
   - **D: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
     - This technique involves using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to boot systems. This is less common and not typically a next step after downloading payloads.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the malicious macros download payloads, the attacker would set up persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware runs at system boot or user logon.

### Final Answer: C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
