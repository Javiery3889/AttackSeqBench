### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where threat actors have successfully evaded defenses using techniques like Masquerading (T1036) and Subvert Trust Controls (T1134). The next step in their attack sequence involves gathering internal system information to further their objectives.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking a remote service session to gain unauthorized access. While this can be a method to gain access, it does not directly align with the goal of gathering internal system information.

- **B: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system. This is a common step in the reconnaissance phase where attackers gather information about the system to understand what processes are running, which can help them identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

- **C: T1003.003-NTDS**
  - This technique involves stealing the NTDS.dit file, which contains user account information and password hashes. While this is a valuable step in credential access, it is more specific and typically occurs later in the attack sequence after initial reconnaissance.

- **D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network topology. This is useful for understanding the network environment and identifying potential targets, but it is more focused on remote systems rather than internal system information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Masquerading (T1036)** and **Subvert Trust Controls (T1134)** are techniques used to evade defenses and gain initial access.
2. After gaining access, the next logical step is to gather information about the internal system to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
3. **Process Discovery (T1057)** is a technique that fits this step perfectly, as it involves gathering information about running processes, which can provide valuable insights into the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery**
