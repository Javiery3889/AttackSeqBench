### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used encryption and mimicked legitimate network traffic to evade defenses. The next step in the attack sequence involves communication between the malware and the command and control (C2) server using HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - This technique involves stealing financial information, which is not directly related to the communication method described in the question.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) to communicate with a C2 server. The use of HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string aligns well with this technique.

- **C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. While encryption is mentioned in the question, the focus is on the communication method, not the encryption itself.

- **D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
  - This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which is not relevant to the communication method described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the use of HTTP and a hardcoded User-Agent string for communication between the malware and the C2 server.
2. Among the answer choices, **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant because it specifically involves using common application layer protocols like HTTP for C2 communication.
3. The other choices (T1657, T1573.001, and T1204.001) do not directly address the communication method described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
