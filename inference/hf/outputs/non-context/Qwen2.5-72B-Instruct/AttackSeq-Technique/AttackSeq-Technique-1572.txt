### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Turla group:
1. Leveraged PowerShell to run malware directly in memory for execution.
2. Encrypted payloads to evade detection.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1546 - Event Triggered Execution**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating system event triggers to execute malicious code. It is often used for persistence, but it doesn't fit well between running malware in memory and encrypting payloads.

- **B: T1578 - Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves altering cloud resources to maintain access or evade detection. It is not typically used in the context of running malware in memory and encrypting payloads.

- **C: T1137 - Office Application Startup**
  - This technique involves using Office applications to execute malicious code when the application starts. It is more related to persistence and initial infection vectors, not the sequence described.

- **D: T1120 - Peripheral Device Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying connected peripheral devices, which is not directly related to the sequence of running malware in memory and encrypting payloads.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the sequence described:
1. **Leveraged PowerShell to run malware directly in memory for execution**: This is a common technique for initial execution and maintaining stealth.
2. **Encrypted payloads to evade detection**: This is a technique used to avoid detection by security tools.

The most plausible technique that could occur between these two steps is one that involves maintaining persistence or further evading detection. However, none of the provided choices directly fit this role. The closest fit, though not perfect, is **T1546 - Event Triggered Execution**. This technique can be used to ensure that the malware continues to run even after the initial execution, which could be a logical step before encrypting payloads to further evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: T1546 - Event Triggered Execution
