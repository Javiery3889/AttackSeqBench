### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where adversaries are preparing to launch an attack using spear phishing emails to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The focus is on the preparatory phase where the adversaries acquire and set up the necessary infrastructure, such as domains and malware.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the preparatory phase described in the question:

- **A: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token**
  - This technique involves creating and impersonating access tokens to gain higher privileges. It is typically used during the execution phase of an attack to escalate privileges, not during the preparatory phase.

- **B: T1608.002-Upload Tool**
  - This technique involves uploading tools to a target system. It is used during the execution phase to deploy malware or other tools, not during the preparatory phase.

- **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. It is used to maintain persistence on a compromised system, not during the preparatory phase.

- **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
  - This technique involves developing or acquiring tools, malware, and other capabilities to support the attack. This aligns well with the preparatory phase where adversaries acquire and set up the necessary infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question focuses on the preparatory phase where adversaries acquire and set up infrastructure.
- The technique that best fits this phase is **T1587-Develop Capabilities**.
- This technique involves developing or acquiring tools, malware, and other capabilities, which is exactly what the adversaries are doing when they acquire and prepare domains and malware.

**Final Answer: D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
