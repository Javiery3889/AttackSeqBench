### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where Mustang Panda used spearphished '.lnk' files to deliver payloads like Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves renaming or modifying the appearance of files or services to make them appear legitimate. While this could be used to make the '.lnk' files look legitimate, it is not the primary method of deceiving users into executing them.
- **T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique involves modifying the timestamps of files to make them appear older or newer than they are. This is more about evading detection rather than deceiving users.
- **T1647-Plist File Modification**: This technique involves modifying property list (plist) files on macOS to change the behavior of applications. This is not relevant to the context of deceiving users on Windows systems.
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. This is the most relevant technique for deceiving users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described involves spearphishing, which is a form of phishing.
- Phishing (T1566) is the technique used to trick users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files.
- The other techniques (T1036, T1070.006, T1647) are not directly related to the initial deception of the user.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
