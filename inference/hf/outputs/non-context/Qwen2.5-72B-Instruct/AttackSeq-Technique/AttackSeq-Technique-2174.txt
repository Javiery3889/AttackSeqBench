### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a targeted attack called "Freakyshelly" where the attackers used spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents to achieve initial access.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique was likely used to gather details about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version, before the initial access was achieved.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is used to trick individuals into providing sensitive data or deploying malware. However, this technique is more about the method of delivery and not about gathering specific software details.
- **T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather specific information, such as credentials or other sensitive data. It can be used to gather details about the victim's environment, including software versions.
- **T1597.002-Purchase Technical Data**: This sub-technique involves purchasing technical data from third parties, which is not relevant to the context of gathering information directly from the victim's computer.
- **T1648-Serverless Execution**: This technique involves executing code without the need for a traditional server, often using cloud services. It is not related to gathering information about the victim's software.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about gathering details about the software installed on the victim's computer, including the Microsoft Office version, before the initial access.
- **T1598-Phishing for Information** is the most relevant technique because it involves using phishing to gather specific information, which can include details about the victim's software environment.
- The other techniques do not align as closely with the requirement to gather specific software details before the initial access.

**Final Answer: B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
