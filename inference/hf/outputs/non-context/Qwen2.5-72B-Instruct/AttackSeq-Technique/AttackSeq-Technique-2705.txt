### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the Aurora malware initially gains access through a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6. After gaining access, the malware installs itself and registers a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1059.011-Lua**
  - This technique involves using Lua scripts for command execution. While Lua can be used for various purposes, it is not directly related to the registration of a service or the installation of a backdoor DLL.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While this could be a subsequent step in the attack, it is not the immediate next step after registering a service.

- **C: T1569-System Services**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system services to achieve persistence. Registering a second service pointing to a backdoor DLL is a clear example of this technique. This aligns well with the described sequence.

- **D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
  - This technique involves using SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares to move laterally within a network. While this could be a later step in the attack, it is not the immediate next step after registering a service.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial access is gained through a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
2. The malware then installs itself and registers a second service pointing to the backdoor DLL.
3. The most relevant technique for registering a service is T1569-System Services.

**Final Answer: C: T1569-System Services**
