### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the malware "Cinobi" steals banking credentials using form-grabbing and web traffic modification. It then needs to communicate with its C&C server using a .onion address.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Form-grabbing and web traffic modification (likely part of the initial compromise and data exfiltration).
  - Communication with a C&C server using a .onion address.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - **Description**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to communication with a C&C server or the use of a .onion address.

- **Answer Choice B: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be relevant if the malware is using a tunneling protocol to communicate with the C&C server, but it doesn't specifically mention the use of a .onion address.

- **Answer Choice C: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves using an external proxy to route traffic through an intermediary server.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because a .onion address is typically accessed through the Tor network, which acts as an external proxy to anonymize the communication.

- **Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to communication with a C&C server or the use of a .onion address.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Compromise and Data Exfiltration**: Cinobi uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials.
2. **Communication with C&C Server**: The malware needs to communicate with its C&C server using a .onion address.
3. **Relevance of TTPs**:
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: Not directly relevant to communication with a C&C server.
   - **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: Could be relevant but doesn't specifically mention the use of a .onion address.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy**: Highly relevant because the Tor network acts as an external proxy to route traffic to a .onion address.
   - **T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: Not directly relevant to communication with a C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: T1090.002-External Proxy**
