### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where:
1. Keylogging capabilities were used to gain administrator passwords.
2. Writable mass storage devices were used for USB infection to spread across the network.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers utilized writable mass storage devices for USB infection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - SSH Hijacking involves intercepting and manipulating SSH sessions. This technique is typically used to gain unauthorized access to remote systems. It does not directly relate to keylogging or the use of writable mass storage devices.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - Application Layer Protocol involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) to communicate with remote systems. This technique is used for command and control (C2) and data exfiltration. It does not directly relate to keylogging or the use of writable mass storage devices.

- **C: T1216.001-PubPrn**
  - PubPrn is a specific technique where attackers use the `pubprn.vbs` script to execute arbitrary commands on a remote system. This technique is used for lateral movement and does not directly relate to keylogging or the use of writable mass storage devices.

- **D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - Exploitation of Remote Services involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to a system. This technique is often used to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network. It can be a plausible step before using writable mass storage devices for USB infection, as it can provide the necessary access to deploy the USB infection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Keylogging**: The attackers used keylogging to gain administrator passwords. This is typically an early step in the attack to gather credentials.
2. **Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)**: After gaining the administrator passwords, the attackers would likely use these credentials to exploit remote services and gain access to other systems in the network. This step is crucial for lateral movement and setting up the environment for further attacks.
3. **Writable Mass Storage Devices for USB Infection**: Once the attackers have access to multiple systems, they can use writable mass storage devices to spread the infection across the network.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the use of writable mass storage devices for USB infection is **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**.

**Final Answer: D: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
