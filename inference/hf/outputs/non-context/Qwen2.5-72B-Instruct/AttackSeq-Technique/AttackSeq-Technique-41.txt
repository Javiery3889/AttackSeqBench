### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker steals credentials from browsers (Firefox and Chrome) and then uploads stolen keystrokes and screenshots to a Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware uploaded the stolen data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1491.002 - External Defacement**
  - External defacement involves altering the content of a website to display a message or image chosen by the attacker. This technique is not related to the exfiltration of stolen data or the use of C2 infrastructure.

- **B: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
  - Indicator removal involves techniques to remove or alter forensic evidence on a compromised system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of stolen data.

- **C: T1102 - Web Service**
  - Web service involves using legitimate web services to host and transfer data. This technique is relevant to the exfiltration of stolen data, as the malware could use web services to upload the stolen keystrokes and screenshots to the C2 infrastructure.

- **D: T1090.002 - External Proxy**
  - External proxy involves using a third-party system to route network traffic. While this could be used to obfuscate the origin of the traffic, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of stolen data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of actions described involves stealing credentials and then exfiltrating data to a C2 infrastructure.
- The most relevant technique for exfiltrating data is **T1102 - Web Service**, as it involves using legitimate web services to transfer data, which aligns with the described action of uploading stolen keystrokes and screenshots.

**Final Answer: C: T1102 - Web Service**
