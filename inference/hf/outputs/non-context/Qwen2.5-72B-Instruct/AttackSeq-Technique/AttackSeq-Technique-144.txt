### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Phosphorus group used ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain access to a Microsoft Exchange Server and deployed the PowerLess Backdoor.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **ProxyShell Vulnerabilities**: This is a set of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
  - **PowerLess Backdoor**: This is a backdoor that the attackers deploy to maintain persistent access to the compromised system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. While this is relevant to the initial access via ProxyShell, the question asks what happened **after** gaining access and deploying the backdoor.
  - **Evaluation**: Not the most plausible choice for the next step.

- **Answer Choice B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This is not relevant to the scenario described, which involves a targeted attack on a specific server.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071.004-DNS**
  - This technique involves using DNS for command and control (C2) communications. After deploying a backdoor, attackers often need to establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised system.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a plausible choice, as it aligns with the need to communicate with the deployed backdoor.

- **Answer Choice D: T1112-Modify Registry**
  - This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to change system behavior, such as creating persistence or hiding malicious activities. After deploying a backdoor, attackers might modify the registry to ensure the backdoor runs at system startup or to hide its presence.
  - **Evaluation**: This is also a plausible choice, as it aligns with the need to maintain persistence and hide the backdoor.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access was gained through the ProxyShell vulnerabilities.
  - The PowerLess Backdoor was deployed to maintain persistent access.
  - After deploying the backdoor, the attackers would need to establish a C2 channel and ensure the backdoor runs persistently.
  - Both T1071.004-DNS and T1112-Modify Registry are plausible, but T1071.004-DNS is more directly related to the immediate need to establish C2 communications, which is a critical step after deploying a backdoor.

**Final Answer: C: T1071.004-DNS**
