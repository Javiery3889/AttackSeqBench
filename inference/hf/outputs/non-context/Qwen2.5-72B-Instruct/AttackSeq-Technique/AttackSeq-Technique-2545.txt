### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has gained persistence using a backdoor named Milestone by creating a service and copying itself to a specific directory. The next step in the attack sequence is establishing command and control (C2) through uncompressed communication with the C2 server.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Persistence**: Creating a service named `msupdate2` and copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
  - **Command and Control**: Uncompressed communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves discovering and enumerating containers and resources in cloud environments. It is not directly related to the persistence or C2 communication described in the question.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice B: T1213.005-Messaging Applications**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using messaging applications (e.g., email, chat) for C2 communication. While it could be used for C2, the question specifically mentions uncompressed communication, which is more aligned with a direct web service or network communication.
  - **Evaluation**: Not the most plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the C2 server. Uncompressed communication with a C2 server is a common method used in web service-based C2.
  - **Evaluation**: Highly plausible choice.

- **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves gathering system information (e.g., OS version, network configuration) before establishing C2. While it is a common pre-C2 step, the question does not mention any system information discovery activities.
  - **Evaluation**: Less plausible than T1102.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: The attacker has already gained persistence by creating a service and copying the backdoor to a specific directory.
2. **Next Step**: The next logical step is to establish C2 communication.
3. **C2 Communication**: The question specifies that the communication is uncompressed, which is a common characteristic of web service-based C2.
4. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**: Not relevant to the described attack sequence.
   - **T1213.005-Messaging Applications**: Less relevant as it does not align with the described communication method.
   - **T1102-Web Service**: Highly relevant and aligns with the described communication method.
   - **T1082-System Information Discovery**: Less relevant as it is not mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
