### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker:

1. **Establishing Persistence**: Using a shortcut in the Windows startup folder pointing to a VBE startup script.
2. **Evasion**: Detecting traces of virtualization or malware analysis tools.
3. **Communication with C&C Server**: Involving JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is not related to communication with a C&C server or using JSON-encoded objects. It is more about exfiltrating visual data.

- **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
  - This technique involves using DNS requests to resolve C2 (Command and Control) server addresses. While it is related to communication, it does not specifically mention JSON-encoded objects or public services as dead drop resolvers.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C2 infrastructure. It can involve JSON-encoded objects and public services, which aligns well with the described communication method.

- **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
  - This technique involves using various methods to dynamically resolve C2 server addresses, which can include DNS, web services, and other methods. However, it is a broader category and does not specifically mention JSON-encoded objects or public services as dead drop resolvers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Persistence and Evasion**: The attacker has already established persistence and evaded detection, which are not the focus of the question.
2. **Communication with C&C Server**: The focus is on the communication method involving JSON-encoded objects and public services as dead drop resolvers.
3. **Evaluating Choices**:
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture** is not relevant to communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation** is related to DNS resolution but does not mention JSON or public services.
   - **C: T1102-Web Service** is the most relevant as it involves using web services, which can include JSON-encoded objects and public services.
   - **D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution** is a broader category and does not specifically mention the required elements.

### Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
