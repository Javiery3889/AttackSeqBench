### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware. The sequence is as follows:
1. The malware gathers OS and user details, including Bitcoin wallet addresses.
2. The malware performs an intermediate step (which we need to identify).
3. The malware starts capturing user inputs such as keystrokes and clipboard data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves the use of automated tools to collect data from the system. While it could be part of the initial data gathering, it doesn't specifically fit the intermediate step between gathering OS and user details and capturing user inputs.

- **B: T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software**
  - This technique is related to the use of customer relationship management (CRM) software, which is not relevant to the context of malware capturing user inputs or gathering OS and user details.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This could be a plausible intermediate step, as the malware might need to exfiltrate the gathered data before proceeding to capture user inputs.

- **D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user inputs such as keystrokes and clipboard data. This is the final step in the sequence, not the intermediate step we are looking for.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware gathers OS and user details, including Bitcoin wallet addresses.
2. The malware needs to exfiltrate this data to a C2 server before it starts capturing user inputs.
3. The most plausible technique for exfiltrating data is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
1. T1082-System Information Discovery (gathering OS and user details)
2. T1071-Application Layer Protocol (exfiltrating the gathered data)
3. T1056-Input Capture (capturing user inputs)

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
