### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an adversary uses credential stuffing to gain access to remote services such as a VPN, Citrix, or other network entry points. The task is to identify the MITRE ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated this tactic.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. Credential stuffing is a method where attackers use automated scripts to try a large number of username and password combinations to gain access to accounts. Once successful, the attacker uses these valid accounts to access the network.
  - This aligns well with the scenario described in the question.

- **B: T1564.008-Email Hiding Rules**
  - This technique involves using email hiding rules to hide or filter out emails, which is not directly related to gaining access to remote services through credential stuffing.
  - This does not align with the scenario described in the question.

- **C: T1200-Hardware Additions**
  - This technique involves adding hardware to a system to gain access or perform malicious activities. This is not related to credential stuffing or gaining access to remote services.
  - This does not align with the scenario described in the question.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, network configuration, and installed software. While this can be useful after gaining access, it is not the primary technique used to gain access through credential stuffing.
  - This does not align with the scenario described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes an adversary using credential stuffing to gain access to remote services.
- Credential stuffing involves using valid accounts to gain access.
- The MITRE ATT&CK technique that best describes the use of valid accounts to gain access is T1078-Valid Accounts.

**Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
