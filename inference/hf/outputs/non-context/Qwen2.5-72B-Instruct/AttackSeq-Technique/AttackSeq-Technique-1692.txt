### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10:
1. **Decryption and Injection Mechanisms**: These are used to evade security products.
2. **Loading the PlugX Payload**: This is done by modifying executable header magic values.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1055-Process Injection**
  - **Description**: This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process to execute arbitrary code while evading detection.
  - **Relevance**: This aligns well with the description of using injection mechanisms to evade security products and load the PlugX payload.

- **B: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
  - **Description**: This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers to prevent analysis.
  - **Relevance**: While this is a valid evasion technique, it does not directly relate to the injection and loading of the payload described in the question.

- **C: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about persistence and does not directly relate to the injection and loading of the payload.

- **D: T1480.002-Mutual Exclusion**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using mutual exclusion (mutex) objects to ensure that only one instance of a process runs at a time, often used to avoid conflicts or to signal the presence of a running instance.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about ensuring the uniqueness of the running process and does not directly relate to the injection and loading of the payload.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Decryption and Injection Mechanisms**: These are used to evade security products.
2. **Loading the PlugX Payload**: This is done by modifying executable header magic values.
3. **Process Injection (T1055)**: This technique aligns well with the injection mechanisms described and is a common method for loading and executing payloads like PlugX.

**Final Answer: A: T1055-Process Injection**
