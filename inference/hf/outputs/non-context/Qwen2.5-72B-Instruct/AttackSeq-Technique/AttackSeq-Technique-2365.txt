### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater initially gains access through spear-phishing attacks targeting sectors in the Middle East. After gaining access, the question asks about the technique used to process requests between the clients and the C2 server to support payload delivery and information collection.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Initial Access: Spear-phishing (T1566)
  - Post-Access: Processing requests between clients and C2 server for payload delivery and information collection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using various methods to hide the infrastructure used in an attack, such as using domain fronting or proxy servers.
  - **Evaluation**: While hiding infrastructure is a common technique, it is not directly related to processing requests between clients and the C2 server for payload delivery and information collection.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target.
  - **Evaluation**: This is the initial access method mentioned in the question, but it does not describe the post-access technique for processing requests between clients and the C2 server.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with the C2 server.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is directly related to processing requests between clients and the C2 server, which is the focus of the question. It is a common method for delivering payloads and collecting information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1584.006-Web Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using web services to establish a C2 channel.
  - **Evaluation**: While this technique can be used for C2 communication, it is more specific to using web services, which may not be the most general method for processing requests between clients and the C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question focuses on the technique used to process requests between clients and the C2 server after gaining initial access through spear-phishing.
  - **T1071-Application Layer Protocol** is the most relevant technique because it describes the use of standard application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server, which is essential for payload delivery and information collection.
  - The other techniques (T1665, T1566, and T1584.006) are either not directly related to the post-access communication or are too specific.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
