### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather contacts' email accounts for use in BEC attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of the collected email accounts via a POST web request.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Step 1: Malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to gather contacts' email accounts.
   - Step 2: Collected email accounts are exfiltrated via a POST web request.
   - We need to find the technique that logically fits between these two steps.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up a program to automatically execute at boot or logon. It is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of email accounts.
   - **B: T1137.004-Outlook Home Page**
     - This technique involves modifying the Outlook Home Page to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of email accounts.
   - **C: T1056-Input Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, which can be used to gather credentials or other sensitive information. This could be relevant if the malware is capturing additional information from the user, but it is not the most direct fit for the described sequence.
   - **D: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
     - This technique involves modifying conditional access policies to gain or maintain access to a system. It is not directly related to the collection or exfiltration of email accounts.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical step between accessing Outlook MAPI to gather email accounts and exfiltrating the collected data would be to capture the input or credentials needed to access these accounts. This is because the malware needs to ensure it has the necessary credentials to use the collected email accounts for BEC attacks.
   - Therefore, **T1056-Input Capture** is the most plausible technique that fits between the two described steps.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1056-Input Capture
