### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where SideCopy used njRAT malware with specific victim IDs and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.
- **Key Elements**:
  - **njRAT Malware**: A remote access trojan (RAT) used for various malicious activities.
  - **Victim IDs**: 'kavach' indicates a specific target.
  - **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: Tools used to gather information about files on the infected device.
  - **Exfiltration**: The act of stealing and transferring data from the infected device to the attacker.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1111-Multi-Factor Authentication Interception**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves intercepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens or codes. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of authentication databases.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a strong fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1659-Content Injection**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate content streams. It is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a strong fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1056-Input Capture**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. While it can be used to capture authentication credentials, it is not the primary method of exfiltration.
  - **Evaluation**: Not the most plausible choice for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves the automated transfer of data from the victim's system to the attacker's system. It directly aligns with the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.
  - **Evaluation**: This is the most plausible choice for the described sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **njRAT Malware**: The malware is used to gain remote access to the infected device.
2. **Victim IDs**: The specific victim ID 'kavach' indicates a targeted attack.
3. **GoLang-based file recon plugins**: These tools are used to gather information about files on the infected device, likely to identify and target the Kavach authentication databases.
4. **Exfiltration**: The final step in the attack sequence is the exfiltration of the Kavach authentication databases.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred after the reconnaissance and identification of the target files is the exfiltration of the data.

**Final Answer: D: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
