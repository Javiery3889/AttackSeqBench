### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already achieved credential access using tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - The attacker then used 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks to facilitate lateral movement.
   - The next step in the sequence is to map databases, servers, and open ports within the target network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying active network connections, but it is more focused on external connections rather than internal network mapping.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1654-Log Enumeration**
     - This technique involves collecting and analyzing log files, which is useful for post-attack analysis but not for mapping the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
     - This technique involves using stolen credentials, which has already been covered in the question with the use of ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying network services, such as databases, servers, and open ports, which aligns perfectly with the described need to map the internal network.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question involves:
     1. Achieving credential access using ProcDump and Mimikatz.
     2. Using 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks to move laterally.
     3. Mapping the internal network to identify databases, servers, and open ports.
   - Among the given answer choices, T1046-Network Service Discovery is the most appropriate technique for the third step, as it directly involves identifying network services and resources.

**Final Answer: D: T1046-Network Service Discovery**
