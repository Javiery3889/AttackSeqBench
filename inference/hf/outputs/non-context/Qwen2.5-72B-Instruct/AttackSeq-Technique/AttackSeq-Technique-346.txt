### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where threat actors gain initial access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique. After gaining access, they execute code using system services.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Initial Access**: Supply Chain Compromise (T1195)
  - **Execution**: Using system services

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary discovering running processes on a system.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly align with the execution of code using system services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary removing or modifying existing persistence mechanisms.
  - **Relevance**: This is more about maintaining access and is not directly related to the execution of code using system services.

- **Answer Choice C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary using AutoHotKey or AutoIT scripts to execute code.
  - **Relevance**: While this is a method of execution, it is specific to using these scripting tools, not system services.

- **Answer Choice D: T1569-System Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the adversary using system services to execute code.
  - **Relevance**: This directly aligns with the scenario described, where the threat actors execute code using system services.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The threat actors gain access through a compromised software update using the Supply Chain Compromise technique (T1195).
2. **Execution**: After gaining access, they execute code using system services.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - **A: T1057-Process Discovery** - Not directly related to execution using system services.
   - **B: T1070.009-Clear Persistence** - Not directly related to execution using system services.
   - **C: T1059.010-AutoHotKey & AutoIT** - Specific to using these scripting tools, not system services.
   - **D: T1569-System Services** - Directly aligns with the execution of code using system services.

**Final Answer: D: T1569-System Services**
