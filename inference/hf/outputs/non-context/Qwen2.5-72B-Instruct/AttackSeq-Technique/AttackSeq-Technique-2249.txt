### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence involving SideCopy, a known threat actor. The sequence includes the use of malicious LNK files and the deployment of various RATs and plugins.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Malicious LNK files**: These are often used to execute malicious code when a user interacts with the LNK file.
  - **RATs and plugins**: These are typically deployed after initial access to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically used in the context of an infection chain that starts with malicious LNK files. It is more about long-term, strategic access through trusted relationships.

- **Answer Choice B: T1036-Masquerading**
  - **Description**: This technique involves renaming or modifying files to appear legitimate to users and security tools.
  - **Relevance**: This is a plausible technique to use after gaining initial access through a malicious LNK file. The attacker might masquerade the RATs and plugins to avoid detection.

- **Answer Choice C: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using legitimate network protocols to blend in with normal traffic to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to exfiltrate data, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately after initial access and before deploying RATs and plugins.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sending malicious emails to trick users into clicking on links or opening attachments.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is often used as an initial access vector, but the question already states that the initial access was through malicious LNK files. Therefore, this technique is less likely to be the next step in the sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with malicious LNK files, which are used to execute malicious code.
2. **Post-Initial Access**: After gaining initial access, the attacker needs to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
3. **Masquerading**: The most logical next step is to masquerade the RATs and plugins to make them appear legitimate, thus avoiding detection by security tools and users.

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
