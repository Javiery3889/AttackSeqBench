### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the WinDealer malware:
1. Execution of the malware.
2. Configuration of the malware by reading a configuration file.
3. Loading a DLL module.
4. Discovery of information about the infected PC and network configuration.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware discovered information about the infected PC and network configuration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an external proxy to route network traffic. It is typically used to evade detection or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This is not directly related to the initial configuration and discovery phase of the malware.

- **B: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves detecting and evading virtualized environments or sandboxes. While this can be an important step in the malware's lifecycle, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration.

- **C: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves renaming or masquerading files, directories, or services to appear legitimate. This can be used to avoid detection and to blend in with the system. However, it is not directly related to the discovery of system and network information.

- **D: T1518-Software Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering software and system information, which is directly related to the malware's need to gather information about the infected PC and network configuration. This is the most logical step before the malware can proceed to use the discovered information for further actions.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The malware is executed and configured by reading a configuration file and loading a DLL module.
2. Before the malware can discover information about the infected PC and network configuration, it needs to perform a discovery step.
3. The most relevant ATT&CK technique for this discovery step is T1518-Software Discovery.

**Final Answer: D: T1518-Software Discovery**
