### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious macro is activated, leading to payload execution. Following this, multiple files are dropped, including a .VBS script, .inf file, and scriptlet file, which are used to bypass AppLocker through publicly available code.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves altering the appearance of files or information to avoid detection. While obfuscation might be used in the initial stages of the attack, it does not directly follow the dropping of multiple files to bypass AppLocker.

- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. This is a plausible next step after dropping files, as the attacker might want to ensure the payload is executed at a specific time or under certain conditions.

- **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**
  - This technique involves executing code without the need for a traditional server, often using cloud services. This does not fit the context of dropping files and bypassing AppLocker.

- **D: T1599.001-Network Address Translation Traversal**
  - This technique involves bypassing network address translation (NAT) to establish a connection. This is not relevant to the described sequence of dropping files and bypassing AppLocker.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Malicious Macro Activation**: The attack starts with a malicious macro being activated, leading to payload execution.
2. **Dropping Multiple Files**: The payload drops multiple files, including a .VBS script, .inf file, and scriptlet file.
3. **Bypassing AppLocker**: These files are used to bypass AppLocker, which is a security feature that controls which files can run on a system.
4. **Next Logical Step**: After bypassing AppLocker and ensuring the files are in place, the attacker would likely want to ensure the payload is executed. Creating a scheduled task or job (T1053) is a common and effective way to achieve this.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
