### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. Initial access is achieved through a weaponized link.
2. The user is directed to a .wsc file.
3. MUSTANG PANDA then utilizes redirections and fileless implementations of legitimate tools to evade defenses.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the evasion techniques (redirections and fileless implementations).

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1207 - Rogue Domain Controller**
  - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials and other sensitive information. It is not typically used immediately after initial access and before evasion techniques.

- **B: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to evade detection. While it is an evasion technique, it is not typically the first step after initial access.

- **C: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It is a common technique used after initial access to perform various actions, including setting up further stages of the attack.

- **D: T1559.001 - Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Component Object Model (COM) to execute code and perform actions. It is often used in fileless attacks to evade detection, but it is more of an evasion technique rather than a step taken immediately after initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a weaponized link that directs the user to a .wsc file.
2. **Execution**: After the user is directed to the .wsc file, the next logical step is to execute the code or script contained in the .wsc file.
3. **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**: This technique is commonly used to execute the code or script, which can then set up further stages of the attack.
4. **Evasion**: After the initial execution, the attacker uses redirections and fileless implementations to evade defenses.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the evasion techniques is **T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: C: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
