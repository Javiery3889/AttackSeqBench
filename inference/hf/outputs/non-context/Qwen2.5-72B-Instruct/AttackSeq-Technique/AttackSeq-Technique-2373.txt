### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a master program (netsat.exe) is used to control and communicate with malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) for execution and data collection.
   - The focus is on the final step of the attack sequence, which involves cleaning up traces of the malware to avoid detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging:**
     - This technique involves preventing the logging of commands executed by the attacker. While this can help in avoiding detection, it is more about preventing the recording of actions rather than cleaning up existing traces.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal:**
     - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as files, registry keys, and logs. This is directly related to cleaning up traces of the malware to avoid detection.
   - **C: T1082-System Information Discovery:**
     - This technique involves gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, network configuration, and installed software. This is typically used in the reconnaissance phase and is not related to cleaning up traces.
   - **D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation:**
     - This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges or to impersonate other users. This is more about maintaining access and privilege escalation, not about cleaning up traces.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks about the technique used to clean up traces of the malware to avoid detection.
   - Among the given choices, **T1070-Indicator Removal** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the removal of indicators that could be used to detect the presence of the malware.
   - The other techniques (A, C, and D) do not align as closely with the described final step of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
