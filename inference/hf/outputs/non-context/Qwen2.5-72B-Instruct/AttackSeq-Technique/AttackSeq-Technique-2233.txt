### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events involving the Grabit malware:
1. The malware sends an HTTP request to a compromised remote server.
2. The malware is downloaded via a malicious macro.
3. The malware needs to maintain persistence on the infected system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the need to maintain persistence on the infected system:

- **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. It is not directly related to maintaining persistence on the system.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common method for maintaining persistence.

- **C: T1546.011-Application Shimming**
  - This technique involves using application shimming to modify the behavior of legitimate applications. While it can be used for persistence, it is less common and more specific than other methods.

- **D: T1546.001-Change Default File Association**
  - This technique involves changing the default file associations to ensure that the malware is executed when certain file types are opened. This can also be used for persistence but is less common than boot or logon autostart execution.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Identify the Need for Persistence**: The question specifically asks about maintaining persistence on the infected system.
2. **Evaluate the Techniques**:
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels** is not related to persistence.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is a common and effective method for maintaining persistence.
   - **T1546.011-Application Shimming** and **T1546.001-Change Default File Association** are less common and more specific methods for persistence.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for maintaining persistence in this scenario is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
