### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script decrypts registry contents, executes a new script, and ultimately establishes njRAT as a remote access tool (RAT). We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after these steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary one fails. While this could be relevant in a broader context, it doesn't directly follow the sequence of decrypting registry contents and executing a new script.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a remote system. After establishing njRAT, the attacker would likely need to communicate with the C2 server using a common protocol to maintain control over the compromised system. This is a plausible next step.

- **C: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves using asymmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data. While encryption and decryption are part of the initial steps, the question is asking about what happens after the RAT is established. Asymmetric cryptography is not typically the next step in this context.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to load and execute code. While this could be part of the initial script execution, it doesn't directly follow the establishment of njRAT as a RAT.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The PowerShell script decrypts registry contents and executes a new script.
2. The new script establishes njRAT as a remote access tool.
3. After establishing njRAT, the attacker needs to communicate with the C2 server to control the compromised system.
4. The most likely technique to follow is the use of common application layer protocols to maintain communication with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
