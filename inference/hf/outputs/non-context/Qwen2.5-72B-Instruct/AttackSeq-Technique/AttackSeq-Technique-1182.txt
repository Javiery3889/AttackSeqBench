### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor collects machine information and screenshots, and then sends this data to a Command and Control (C&C) server. The next step in the sequence involves communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. This does not align with the described sequence, which is about communication and data exfiltration after the backdoor is already in place.

- **B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While this could be part of the data collection phase, it does not describe the communication and data exfiltration to a C&C server.

- **C: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with a C&C server. It fits well with the described sequence, as it involves querying external services and transmitting data, which can be encrypted.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from a C&C server to the compromised system. While this could be part of the attack, it does not describe the communication and data exfiltration phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor has already collected machine information and screenshots.
- The next step is to send this data to the C&C server.
- The communication involves querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages.
- Among the given choices, **T1102-Web Service** is the most appropriate technique because it describes the use of web services for communication and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
