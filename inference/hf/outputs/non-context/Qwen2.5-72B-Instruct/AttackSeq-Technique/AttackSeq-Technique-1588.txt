### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker. The sequence is as follows:
1. T9000 executed malicious functionality through DLL sideloading using `igfxtray.exe`.
2. The attacker customized its installation to evade 24 identified security products.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves loading shared libraries or modules to execute malicious code. While this could be related to DLL sideloading, it is more about the initial execution rather than the steps taken after the initial execution to evade detection.

- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network artifacts to avoid detection. This is a plausible step to take after executing malicious code to ensure that the presence of the malware is not easily detected by security products.

- **C: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - This technique involves automatically collecting data from the system, which is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold. However, it is not directly related to evading security products.

- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves detecting and evading virtualized environments and sandboxes, which is a common step taken to avoid detection by security products. However, it is more about detecting the environment rather than customizing the installation to evade specific security products.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The attacker used DLL sideloading with `igfxtray.exe` to execute malicious functionality (T9000).
2. **Post-Execution**: After the initial execution, the attacker would likely take steps to hide their presence and avoid detection by security products.
3. **Evasion**: The next logical step would be to hide artifacts to make it harder for security products to detect the malicious activity.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between the initial execution and the customization to evade security products is **T1564-Hide Artifacts**.

**Final Answer: B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
