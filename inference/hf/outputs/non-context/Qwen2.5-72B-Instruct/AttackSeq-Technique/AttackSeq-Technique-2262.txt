### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where a batch file is executed, which downloads and runs a PowerShell script at the memory level. After this, persistence is achieved through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the persistence was established.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing involves tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments. This could be the initial vector for executing the batch file, but it doesn't directly relate to the execution of the batch file and the subsequent actions.

- **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
  - Socket filters are a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This is not directly related to the execution of a batch file or the downloading and running of a PowerShell script.

- **C: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
  - This technique involves compromising software dependencies or development tools to introduce malicious code. While this could be a method to deliver the batch file, it is not the most likely technique given the context of the question.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. This is a plausible technique for downloading and running a PowerShell script, as it involves network communication to download the script.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The batch file is executed, which downloads and runs a PowerShell script.
2. **Network Communication**: The batch file likely uses an application layer protocol (T1071) to download the PowerShell script from a remote server.
3. **Memory Execution**: The PowerShell script is executed at the memory level.
4. **Persistence**: Persistence is achieved through startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

Given the sequence of events, the most likely technique that occurred before persistence was established is the use of an application layer protocol to download the PowerShell script.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
