### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging (defense evasion) and then extracted credentials from the compromised system.
- We need to identify which ATT&CK technique logically follows the use of PowerShell for defense evasion and involves credential extraction.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using protocols other than the standard ones. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not directly involve credential extraction.
- **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: This technique involves using Kerberos tickets to authenticate to a service or system. It is a method of credential use, not credential extraction.
- **T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: This technique involves attacking the Kerberos Authentication Service (AS) to obtain and crack AS-REP responses. It is a method of credential attack, not extraction.
- **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: This technique involves extracting credentials from the operating system, such as from memory, the registry, or credential stores. This aligns with the described action of extracting credentials from the compromised system.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion**: Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging, which is a defense evasion technique.
2. **Credential Extraction**: The next step involves extracting credentials from the compromised system.
3. **Evaluating Choices**:
   - **T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**: Not directly related to credential extraction.
   - **T1550.003-Pass the Ticket**: Involves using credentials, not extracting them.
   - **T1558.004-AS-REP Roasting**: Involves attacking credentials, not extracting them.
   - **T1003-OS Credential Dumping**: Directly involves extracting credentials from the operating system.

### Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping
