### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through the exploitation of a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).
   - After gaining execution capabilities, BBSRAT is used to execute a payload via process hollowing.
   - The payload is executed through a legitimate Citrix executable, `ssonsvr.exe`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - **Execution:** Using BBSRAT with process hollowing.
   - **Persistence/Execution:** Leveraging `ssonsvr.exe` to execute the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1569-System Services:** This technique involves modifying or creating system services to achieve persistence or privilege escalation. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it doesn't specifically align with the use of a legitimate executable to execute a payload.
   - **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools:** This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious code. This is closer to the scenario but doesn't specifically mention the use of a legitimate executable.
   - **C: T1542-Pre-OS Boot:** This technique involves modifying the boot process to achieve persistence. This is not relevant to the described attack sequence.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:** This technique involves modifying the boot or logon processes to ensure that the malicious code is executed automatically. This is highly relevant because `ssonsvr.exe` is a legitimate executable that can be used to achieve persistence and ensure the payload is executed at logon.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Access:** The attacker exploits CVE-2012-0158 to gain initial access.
2. **Execution:** BBSRAT is used to execute the payload via process hollowing, which is a technique to inject malicious code into a legitimate process.
3. **Persistence/Execution:** The payload is executed through `ssonsvr.exe`, a legitimate Citrix executable. This suggests that the attacker is using a technique to ensure the payload is executed at logon, which aligns with T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
