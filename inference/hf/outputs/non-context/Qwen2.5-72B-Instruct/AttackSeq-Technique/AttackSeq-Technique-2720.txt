### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group is preparing to gain initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
- The focus is on the preparatory phase, specifically targeting specific individuals within the defense industry.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **A: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**: This technique involves stealing credentials from files on a system. This is more relevant to post-compromise activities rather than the initial targeting phase.
- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about specific individuals, such as names, job titles, and contact details. This is highly relevant to the preparatory phase of a spear-phishing attack, as it helps in crafting more convincing and targeted emails.
- **C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While this can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more general and less specific to targeting individuals.
- **D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malicious software. This is more relevant to the execution phase rather than the preparatory phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: Identify the phase of the attack. The question is about the preparatory phase before the initial access.
- **Step 2**: Evaluate the relevance of each technique to the preparatory phase.
  - **A**: Not relevant to the preparatory phase.
  - **B**: Highly relevant to the preparatory phase, as it involves gathering information about specific individuals.
  - **C**: Relevant to the preparatory phase but less specific to targeting individuals.
  - **D**: Not relevant to the preparatory phase.
- **Step 3**: Choose the most plausible technique based on the context.

**Final Answer: B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
