### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in RTF files.
2. The attacker uses spear phishing to gain remote access.
3. The attacker needs to facilitate communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access. While it is part of the initial attack vector, it does not describe the communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.

- **B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - This technique involves manipulating the system's path to execute malicious code. It is not related to facilitating communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.

- **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic and obfuscate the origin of the communication. While it can be used to facilitate communication, it is more about obfuscation and not the initial setup of communication.

- **D: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. It is a common method for malware to establish a command and control (C2) channel, which is necessary for the malware to communicate with the cloud infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial attack vector involves exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files and using spear phishing to gain remote access.
2. After gaining access, the attacker needs to set up a communication channel between the malware and the cloud infrastructure.
3. Among the given choices, **T1102-Web Service** is the most appropriate technique for establishing this communication channel.

**Final Answer: D: T1102-Web Service**
