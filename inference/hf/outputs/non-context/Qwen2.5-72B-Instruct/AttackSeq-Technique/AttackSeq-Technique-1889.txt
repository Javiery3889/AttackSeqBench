### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where FIN13, a threat actor, has used a custom passive backdoor (BLUEAGAVE) to establish a local HTTP server for incoming requests within the victim's environment.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Custom passive backdoor (BLUEAGAVE)
  - Establishment of a local HTTP server

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1204.001 - Malicious Link**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain initial access. It does not align well with the scenario where a local HTTP server has already been established.

- **Answer Choice B: T1505 - Server Software Component**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of server software components to maintain persistence or execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant because it involves the use of server software, which aligns with the establishment of a local HTTP server. The local HTTP server can be used to maintain persistence or execute further commands.

- **Answer Choice C: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of command shells and scripting interpreters to execute commands and scripts.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is often used in the context of executing commands, it does not specifically align with the establishment of a local HTTP server. It could be a subsequent step but is not the most likely immediate next step.

- **Answer Choice D: T1213.005 - Messaging Applications**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of messaging applications to communicate with the attacker.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is less relevant to the establishment of a local HTTP server. It is more about communication and exfiltration, which might occur later in the attack sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: FIN13 uses a custom passive backdoor (BLUEAGAVE) to gain access to the victim's environment.
2. **Establishment of Local HTTP Server**: Once access is gained, a local HTTP server is established to handle incoming requests.
3. **Next Logical Step**: The most logical next step would be to use the local HTTP server to maintain persistence or execute further commands, which aligns with the use of server software components (T1505).

**Final Answer: B: T1505 - Server Software Component**
