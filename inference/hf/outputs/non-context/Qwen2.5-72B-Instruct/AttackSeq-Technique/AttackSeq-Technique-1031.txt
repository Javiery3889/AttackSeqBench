### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor "Kingslayer." The sequence includes:
1. A diurnal beacon sleep algorithm for Defense Evasion.
2. The use of a stolen code signing private key.
3. Deployment into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**
  - This technique involves compromising the hardware supply chain, which is not mentioned in the question. The question focuses on software subversion, not hardware.

- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party software supply chain to gain access to target systems. This aligns well with the description of deploying into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

- **C: T1021.005-VNC**
  - This technique involves using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access. While this could be a part of the attack, it does not fit the context of the initial deployment via software subversion.

- **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - This technique involves using remote access software to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system. While this could be used after initial access, it does not fit the context of the initial deployment via software subversion.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sophisticated software subversion to deploy the malware into enterprise environments.
2. The use of a stolen code signing private key suggests that the malware was signed to appear legitimate, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks.
3. The diurnal beacon sleep algorithm is a technique used for defense evasion, which would be employed after the initial deployment to avoid detection.

Given these points, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the initial deployment was facilitated by a supply chain compromise.

**Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
