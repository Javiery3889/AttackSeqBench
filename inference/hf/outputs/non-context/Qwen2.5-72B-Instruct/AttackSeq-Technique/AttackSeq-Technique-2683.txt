### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor KiraV2:
1. Conducts telnet dictionary attacks to compromise IoT devices by exploiting weak credentials.
2. Employs anti-analysis techniques to evade detection and maintain a long-term infection.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the anti-analysis techniques.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating Component Object Model (COM) objects to execute malicious code. This is typically used for persistence and is not directly related to the initial compromise or anti-analysis.

- **B: T1653-Power Settings**
  - This technique involves changing power settings to prevent the system from entering a low-power state, which can be used to maintain access. However, it is not a common initial step in compromising a device.

- **C: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to use it for malicious purposes. This is not directly related to the initial compromise of IoT devices via telnet dictionary attacks.

- **D: T1110-Brute Force**
  - This technique involves using brute force methods to guess credentials. The question specifically mentions "telnet dictionary attacks to compromise IoT devices by exploiting weak credentials," which is a form of brute force attack.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial action described in the question is a telnet dictionary attack to compromise IoT devices by exploiting weak credentials.
2. A telnet dictionary attack is a form of brute force attack.
3. The ATT&CK technique that best matches this initial action is T1110-Brute Force.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the brute force attack (T1110) occurred before the anti-analysis techniques.

**Final Answer: D: T1110-Brute Force**
