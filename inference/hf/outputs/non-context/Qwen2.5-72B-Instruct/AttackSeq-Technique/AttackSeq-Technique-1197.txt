### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where a malicious Word document containing a macro is executed, which then creates and runs an executable file named "vba_macro.exe".
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Initial Access**: The malicious Word document is executed by a user.
  - **Execution**: The macro within the document creates and runs an executable file.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1485-Data Destruction**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the deletion of data to disrupt availability.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used in the later stages of an attack to destroy data, not immediately after initial execution.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a likely candidate for the immediate next step after the macro execution.

- **Answer Choice B: T1059.008-Network Device CLI**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using the command-line interface of network devices.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not typically associated with the execution of a macro in a Word document.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a likely candidate for the immediate next step after the macro execution.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.005-Cloud Instance Metadata API**
  - **Description**: This technique involves accessing metadata from cloud instances.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to cloud environments and is not typically associated with the execution of a macro in a Word document.
  - **Evaluation**: Not a likely candidate for the immediate next step after the macro execution.

- **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is relevant to the initial stage of the attack where the user is tricked into opening the malicious Word document and enabling the macro.
  - **Evaluation**: While this technique is relevant to the initial stage, the question asks for the technique that occurred after the macro execution.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Initial Access**: The user opens the malicious Word document and enables the macro.
- **Execution**: The macro creates and runs "vba_macro.exe".
- **Next Step**: The most likely next step after the macro execution would be the execution of the newly created executable file, which is part of the same execution process.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the macro execution leads to the creation and running of the executable, which is a form of user execution.

**Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution**
