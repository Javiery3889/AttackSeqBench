### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where FamousSparrow used `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor during the Execution phase.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - **Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` to run commands.
  - **Backdoor Installation**: Downloading and installing SparrowDoor.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sending malicious attachments via email to trick users into executing malware.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used in the initial access phase, not after the backdoor has been installed.

- **Answer Choice B: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is also used in the initial access phase, not after the backdoor has been installed.

- **Answer Choice C: T1134 - Access Token Manipulation**
  - **Description**: This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain higher privileges or to impersonate other users.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used after gaining initial access to escalate privileges or to move laterally within the network. It is a plausible next step after installing a backdoor.

- **Answer Choice D: T1597 - Search Closed Sources**
  - **Description**: This technique involves searching for information in closed or restricted sources, such as internal company documents or databases.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for reconnaissance and data exfiltration, which can occur after gaining access and establishing a backdoor, but it is less directly related to the immediate next step after backdoor installation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: FamousSparrow likely used a technique like spearphishing or exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: Once access was gained, they used `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
3. **Next Steps**: After the backdoor is installed, the attacker would likely want to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network. Access Token Manipulation (T1134) is a common technique for this purpose.

**Final Answer: C: T1134 - Access Token Manipulation**
