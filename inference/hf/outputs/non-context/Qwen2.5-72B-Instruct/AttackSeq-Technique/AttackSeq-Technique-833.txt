### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WinDealer malware.
- **Sequence of TTPs**:
  1. **Defense Evasion**: WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR.
  2. **Discovery**: WinDealer discovered network configuration and SNS application details on the victim's PC.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. It is often used for initial access, execution, and persistence.
  - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique involves directly calling lower-level system functions (APIs) to perform actions. It is often used for defense evasion and execution.
  - **C: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique involves renaming or masquerading malicious files or directories to appear legitimate. It is used for defense evasion.
  - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique involves using asymmetric encryption to protect data. It is used for defense evasion and command and control.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion (XOR Encoding)**: WinDealer encoded its configuration files using XOR. This is a form of defense evasion to avoid detection by security tools.
2. **Discovery (Network Configuration and SNS Application Details)**: After encoding the configuration files, WinDealer needs to gather information about the victim's network and SNS applications. This is a discovery phase.

- **Evaluating the Choices**:
  - **A: T1059.003-Windows Command Shell**: While this technique can be used for various purposes, it is not specifically aligned with the discovery phase of gathering network configuration and SNS application details.
  - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique can be used for various actions, including discovery, but it is more general and less specific to the context of gathering network and SNS details.
  - **C: T1036-Masquerading**: This technique is more aligned with defense evasion, which has already been covered by the XOR encoding. It does not fit the discovery phase.
  - **D: T1573.002-Asymmetric Cryptography**: This technique is more aligned with defense evasion and command and control, not discovery.

- **Best Fit**:
  - **B: T1106-Native API**: This technique is the most plausible because it can be used to directly interact with the system to gather detailed information, such as network configuration and SNS application details, which aligns with the discovery phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1106-Native API
