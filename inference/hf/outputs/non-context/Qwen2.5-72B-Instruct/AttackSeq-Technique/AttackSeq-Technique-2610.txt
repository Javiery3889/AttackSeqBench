### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where VBA macros are used to write a 'network.js' file and modify the registry. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique ensures that NanHaiShu remains active across system reboots.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a malicious program runs automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the goal of maintaining persistence across system reboots.

- **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking Component Object Model (COM) objects to execute malicious code. While this can be used for persistence, it is more specific to hijacking COM objects rather than ensuring execution at boot or logon.

- **C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data to text storage sites, which is not related to maintaining persistence across system reboots.

- **D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering system information, which is useful for reconnaissance but not for maintaining persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **VBA Macros and Registry Modification**: The use of VBA macros to write a 'network.js' file and modify the registry suggests that the attacker is setting up a mechanism to ensure the malware runs automatically.
2. **Persistence Across Reboots**: The goal is to ensure that NanHaiShu remains active even after the system is rebooted.
3. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the need to run the malware at boot or logon.
   - **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** is less relevant as it focuses on a specific method of hijacking COM objects.
   - **C: T1567.003-Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites** is not related to persistence.
   - **D: T1082-System Information Discovery** is not related to persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
