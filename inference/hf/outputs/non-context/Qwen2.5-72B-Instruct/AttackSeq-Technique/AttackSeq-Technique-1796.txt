### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the OceanLotus Group during Operation Cobalt Kitty. The sequence includes:
1. Harvesting credentials from compromised machines.
2. Utilizing Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks for further network infection.

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated the expansion within the network between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1546.008-Accessibility Features**
  - This technique involves modifying accessibility features to maintain persistence. It is not directly related to expanding within the network or using harvested credentials.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic evidence to avoid detection. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it does not facilitate network expansion.

- **C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials to authenticate to systems. This aligns well with the sequence described, as it would be a logical step after harvesting credentials and before using pass-the-hash attacks.

- **D: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking SSH sessions to gain unauthorized access. While it can be used for network expansion, it is not typically associated with Windows environments and pass-the-hash attacks.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Harvesting Credentials**: The attackers have already obtained credentials from compromised machines.
2. **Using Alternate Authentication Material (T1550)**: The next logical step is to use these stolen credentials to authenticate to other systems within the network.
3. **Utilizing Windows Built-in Tools and Pass-the-Hash Attacks**: After gaining access to additional systems using the stolen credentials, the attackers can then use Windows built-in tools and pass-the-hash attacks to further expand their presence in the network.

**Final Answer: C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material**
