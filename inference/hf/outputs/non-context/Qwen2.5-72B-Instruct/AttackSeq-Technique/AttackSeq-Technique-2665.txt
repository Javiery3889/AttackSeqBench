### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Korplug, a malware, communicates with Command and Control (C&C) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol with encrypted communication.
   - The focus is on the malware's ability to maintain communication if a primary server becomes unavailable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves the use of alternative communication channels if the primary channel is disrupted. This aligns well with the scenario where the malware needs to maintain communication if the primary server is unavailable.
   - **B: T1124-System Time Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary discovering the system time, which is not directly related to maintaining communication with C&C servers.
   - **C: T1568-Dynamic Resolution**
     - This technique involves dynamically resolving domain names or IP addresses, which can help in maintaining communication but is more about the initial connection rather than fallback mechanisms.
   - **D: T1574.012-COR_PROFILER**
     - This technique involves using the COR_PROFILER environment variable to inject code into .NET applications, which is not related to maintaining communication with C&C servers.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The scenario specifically mentions the need to maintain communication if a primary server becomes unavailable.
   - **T1008-Fallback Channels** is the most relevant technique because it directly addresses the need for alternative communication channels when the primary one fails.
   - The other techniques (T1124, T1568, and T1574.012) do not directly support the requirement of maintaining communication in the event of a primary server failure.

### Final Answer: A: T1008-Fallback Channels
