### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tropic Trooper used exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the execution of a backdoor installer, which is triggered by user action or interaction.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
   - Next Step: Execution of the backdoor installer triggered by user action or interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
     - This technique involves using encrypted channels to protect command and control (C2) communications. It does not fit the context of user interaction to trigger the backdoor installer.
   - **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
     - This technique involves using resource forks to hide data or code. It is not related to user interaction or the execution of a backdoor installer.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution**
     - This technique involves executing code without a traditional server. It does not fit the context of user interaction to trigger the backdoor installer.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files or commands. It fits the context of the backdoor installer being triggered by user action or interaction.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Tropic Trooper used exploits in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access. This is a known technique for initial access.

2. **Next Step:**
   - The backdoor installer is executed, and this execution is triggered by user action or interaction. This aligns with the technique of tricking users into executing malicious files or commands.

3. **Evaluation of Choices:**
   - **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel** - Not relevant to user interaction.
   - **B: T1564.009-Resource Forking** - Not relevant to user interaction.
   - **C: T1648-Serverless Execution** - Not relevant to user interaction.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution** - Directly relevant to user interaction and the execution of the backdoor installer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
