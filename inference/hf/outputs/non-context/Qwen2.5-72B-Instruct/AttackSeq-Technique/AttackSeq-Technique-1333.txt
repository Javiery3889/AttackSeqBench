### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The attacker has gained command and control (C2) through HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites. The next step involves moving between systems using a `net use` command after positive ping responses.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **C2**: HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications.
  - **Lateral Movement**: Using `net use` command after positive ping responses.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1563.001-SSH Hijacking**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hijacking an existing SSH session to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Relevance**: This does not align with the use of `net use` for lateral movement. SSH hijacking is more about taking over an existing SSH session, which is not mentioned in the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1021-Remote Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using valid accounts to connect to a remote system over a network and execute commands.
  - **Relevance**: The `net use` command is a common method for establishing a connection to a remote system and is often used in conjunction with remote services. This aligns well with the described lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice C: T1106-Native API**
  - **Description**: This technique involves directly calling system APIs to perform actions.
  - **Relevance**: While `net use` can be considered a native command, the question specifically mentions lateral movement, which is more closely associated with remote services.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564.005-Hidden File System**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding files or directories to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This does not align with the use of `net use` for lateral movement. Hidden file systems are more about concealing files, not moving between systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **C2 Establishment**: The attacker has established command and control using HTTP POST communication or encrypted communications with compromised legitimate websites.
2. **Lateral Movement**: The attacker then attempts to move between systems using the `net use` command after positive ping responses.
3. **Relevance of T1021-Remote Services**:
   - `net use` is a command used to connect to a remote system and map network drives.
   - This aligns with the technique of using remote services to move laterally within a network.

**Final Answer: B: T1021-Remote Services**
