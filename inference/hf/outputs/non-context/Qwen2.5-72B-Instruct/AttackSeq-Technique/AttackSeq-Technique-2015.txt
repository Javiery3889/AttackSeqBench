### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by adversaries using BlackEnergy 3 plugins:
1. **Credential Harvesting**: Adversaries used BlackEnergy 3 plugins to harvest credentials.
2. **Network Discovery**: They conducted network discovery functions to identify targets within corporate networks.
3. **Enumeration of Networked Devices**: They enumerated all networked devices on the ICS network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - **Description**: Active Scanning involves probing a network to gather information about its structure and vulnerabilities.
  - **Relevance**: While active scanning is a form of network discovery, the question specifically mentions enumeration of networked devices, which is more specific than general active scanning.

- **B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - **Description**: Remote System Discovery involves identifying active systems on a network, which can include scanning for open ports, services, and other networked devices.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the enumeration of networked devices on the ICS network. It is a more specific and relevant technique for the described action.

- **C: T1564.006-Run Virtual Instance**
  - **Description**: Running a virtual instance involves creating and using virtual machines to conduct malicious activities.
  - **Relevance**: This technique does not align with the described sequence of actions, which focuses on network discovery and enumeration.

- **D: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - **Description**: Cloud Account involves the use of cloud-based services and accounts for various malicious activities.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to the described sequence, which is focused on network discovery and enumeration within a corporate and ICS network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence of actions that include credential harvesting, network discovery, and enumeration of networked devices.
2. The most relevant technique for the enumeration of networked devices is **T1018-Remote System Discovery**.
3. The other techniques (T1595, T1564.006, and T1087.004) do not align as closely with the specific action of enumerating networked devices on the ICS network.

**Final Answer: B: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
