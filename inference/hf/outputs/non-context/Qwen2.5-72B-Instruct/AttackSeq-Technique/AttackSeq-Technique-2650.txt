### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Dridex malware:
1. Initial access is gained through malicious documents.
2. Macros are used to download the payload.
3. Dridex employs anti-debugging methods using OutputDebugStringW to complicate analysis.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur before the anti-debugging methods are employed.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command. While this can be used for persistence or execution, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately before anti-debugging methods.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. While this is a common technique used by malware, it is not directly related to the anti-debugging methods described.

- **C: T1059.002-AppleScript**
  - This technique involves using AppleScript on macOS to execute commands. Since Dridex is primarily a Windows-based malware, this technique is not relevant to the described scenario.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules to load and execute code. This can be used to load additional components of the malware, which might include the anti-debugging code. This technique is more likely to occur before the anti-debugging methods are employed.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access and Payload Download**:
   - Dridex gains initial access through malicious documents and uses macros to download the payload.
2. **Loading Additional Components**:
   - Before employing anti-debugging methods, Dridex likely loads additional components or modules to perform various tasks, including anti-debugging.
3. **Anti-Debugging**:
   - Once the necessary components are loaded, Dridex employs anti-debugging methods using OutputDebugStringW to complicate analysis.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurs before the anti-debugging methods is **T1129-Shared Modules**.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
