### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server using legitimate tools to evade detection. The focus is on the technique that enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, which is a method of credential theft. While this is part of the attack, it does not directly address how the attack remained undetected.

- **B: T1036-Masquerading**
  - This technique involves renaming or modifying the attributes of files, commands, or services to make them appear legitimate. This can help evade detection by security tools and users. This technique aligns well with the use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid triggering behavior-based detectors.

- **C: T1053.002-At**
  - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command, which can be used to execute commands at a specified time. While this can be used to evade detection, it does not directly address the use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid behavior-based detection.

- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While this can help in maintaining persistence and evading detection, it does not directly address the use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid behavior-based detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks for the technique that enabled the attack to remain undetected by using legitimate tools and scripts without triggering behavior-based detectors.
- **T1036-Masquerading** (B) is the most relevant technique because it involves making malicious activities appear legitimate, which is crucial for evading detection by security tools and behavior-based detectors.
- The other techniques (A, C, and D) are related to different aspects of the attack but do not directly address the use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: B: T1036-Masquerading**
