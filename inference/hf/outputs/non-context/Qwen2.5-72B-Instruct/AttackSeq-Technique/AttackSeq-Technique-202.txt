### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where FamousSparrow, a known threat actor, exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities to gain initial access. After gaining initial access, they ran commands to install SparrowDoor, a backdoor. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the execution of these commands.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves the acquisition of infrastructure such as domains, servers, and other resources. This is typically done before the attack to set up the necessary infrastructure for the attack. However, it does not directly relate to the sequence of events described in the question, which focuses on the actions taken after gaining initial access.

- **B: T1021.003-Distributed Component Object Model**
  - This technique involves using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement. While this could be a technique used after gaining initial access, it is not directly related to the installation of SparrowDoor.

- **C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server**
  - This technique involves the use of a Virtual Private Server (VPS) as part of the infrastructure. Similar to T1583, this is more about the setup of the attack infrastructure and not the actions taken after gaining initial access.

- **D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
  - This technique involves the use of obfuscation to hide the true nature of files or commands. This is a common technique used to evade detection and can be used to obfuscate the commands used to install SparrowDoor. Given that the question mentions running commands to install SparrowDoor, it is plausible that these commands were obfuscated to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: FamousSparrow exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. **Execution of Commands**: After gaining access, they ran commands to install SparrowDoor.
3. **Obfuscation**: To avoid detection, it is likely that the commands used to install SparrowDoor were obfuscated.

Given the sequence of events and the need to avoid detection, the most plausible technique that occurred before the execution of the commands to install SparrowDoor is **T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**.

**Final Answer: D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
