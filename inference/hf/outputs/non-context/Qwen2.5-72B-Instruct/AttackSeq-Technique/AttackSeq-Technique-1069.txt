### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has collected and exfiltrated system information and screenshots to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server. The communication with the server is facilitated using HTTP on port 443. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated this communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a web service, which aligns with the exfiltration of system information and screenshots to a Mattermost server. However, it does not specifically address the communication method (HTTP on port 443).

- **B: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. It is a broader technique that can include exfiltration and communication over web services, which fits the scenario of using HTTP on port 443 to communicate with the Mattermost server.

- **C: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - This technique involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network controls. While it could be used to tunnel HTTP traffic, it is not the most direct fit for the described scenario, which focuses on using HTTP directly.

- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms that ensure the malware runs at boot or logon. It does not relate to the communication method used to exfiltrate data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)**: While this technique is relevant to the exfiltration part, it does not specifically address the communication method (HTTP on port 443).
2. **Web Service (T1102)**: This technique is the most relevant because it involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure, which aligns with the use of HTTP on port 443 to communicate with the Mattermost server.
3. **Protocol Tunneling (T1572)**: This technique is less relevant as it involves encapsulating one protocol within another, which is not the primary method described in the scenario.
4. **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547)**: This technique is not relevant to the communication method used for exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
