### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where Cinobi, a malware, uses form-grabbing and web traffic modification to steal banking credentials. After stealing the credentials, it communicates with its C&C server over the Tor proxy to download additional malware stages and configuration files.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Form-grabbing and web traffic modification (not directly relevant to the answer choices).
  - Communication with C&C server over Tor proxy.
  - Downloading additional malware stages and configuration files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying firmware to maintain persistence or evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server or downloading additional malware stages.

- **Answer Choice B: T1090-Proxy**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because the question specifically mentions communication over the Tor proxy, which is a type of proxy used to anonymize network traffic.

- **Answer Choice C: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using fast flux DNS to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with a domain to make it difficult to track or block.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to obfuscate C&C communication, it is not specifically mentioned in the question and is not as directly relevant as using a proxy.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or downloading malware through deceptive emails or websites.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the communication with a C&C server or downloading additional malware stages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the use of a Tor proxy to communicate with a C&C server.
  - The most relevant technique for this scenario is T1090-Proxy, as it directly involves using a proxy to route network traffic.
  - The other techniques (T1542.002, T1568.001, and T1566) do not align as closely with the described communication method.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
