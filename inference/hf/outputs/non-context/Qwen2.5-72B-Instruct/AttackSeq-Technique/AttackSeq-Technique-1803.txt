### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where an attacker receives instructions from C2 (Command and Control) servers to encode configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. The goal is to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: 
  - C2 communication
  - Encoding configuration files using single-byte XOR keys
  - Disruption of websites

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying autostart entries to ensure that a program runs when a user logs in.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about persistence and ensuring that malware runs at startup, which is not directly related to the disruption of websites.

- **Answer Choice B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
  - **Description**: This technique involves disrupting network availability by flooding the target with traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the goal of disrupting websites. However, it does not directly involve encoding configuration files.

- **Answer Choice C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**
  - **Description**: This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with resource requests to cause a denial of service.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is also about causing a denial of service, but it focuses on exhausting system resources rather than network traffic. It does not directly involve encoding configuration files.

- **Answer Choice D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying domain properties to control or manipulate DNS settings.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be used to redirect traffic or manipulate DNS settings, which could indirectly lead to website disruption. However, it does not directly involve encoding configuration files.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **C2 Communication**: The attacker receives instructions from C2 servers, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
2. **Encoding Configuration Files**: The attacker encodes configuration files using single-byte XOR keys. This step is likely to obfuscate the configuration files to prevent detection and analysis.
3. **Disruption of Websites**: The goal is to disrupt websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong. This could be achieved through various means, including network denial of service attacks.

- **Evaluation**:
  - **A: T1547.013-XDG Autostart Entries**: Not directly relevant to website disruption.
  - **B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**: Directly relevant to website disruption.
  - **C: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**: Relevant to denial of service but not directly to website disruption.
  - **D: T1590.001-Domain Properties**: Relevant to manipulation of DNS but not directly to website disruption.

**Final Answer: B: T1498-Network Denial of Service**
