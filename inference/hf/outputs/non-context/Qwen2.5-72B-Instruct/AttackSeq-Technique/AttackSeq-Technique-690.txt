### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Persistence**: The Pierogi backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
     - **Information Collection**: The backdoor collected information about the infected machine, such as the computer name and antivirus details.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1587.004-Exploits**
     - This technique involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain initial access or escalate privileges. It is typically used in the early stages of an attack, not between persistence and information collection.
   - **B: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging**
     - This technique involves preventing the logging of command history to avoid detection. It is a defensive evasion technique that could be used after gaining persistence to avoid leaving traces.
   - **C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
     - This is a broader category that includes various techniques to impair defenses, such as disabling security tools. It could be used after gaining persistence to ensure the backdoor remains undetected.
   - **D: T1204-User Execution**
     - This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious files, which is typically used for initial access, not between persistence and information collection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence (T1547.001 - Shortcut Modification)**: The backdoor adds a shortcut to the startup folder to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
   - **Impair Defenses (T1562)**: After achieving persistence, the attacker might want to impair defenses to avoid detection and ensure the backdoor remains active.
   - **Information Collection (T1082 - System Information Discovery)**: The backdoor then collects information about the infected machine.

   Given the sequence, the most logical step between achieving persistence and collecting information is to impair defenses to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses
