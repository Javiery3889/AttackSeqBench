### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals have already downloaded remote administration tools during the execution phase. The next phase mentioned is the discovery phase, where the attackers are exploring the financial systems of the targeted organization.
- **Key Phrases**: "discovery phase," "explored the financial systems."

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1201-Password Policy Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the attacker attempting to discover the password policies of the target organization, such as password complexity requirements, expiration, and lockout policies.
  - **Relevance**: While this could be useful for further attacks, it is not directly related to exploring the financial systems.

- **Answer Choice B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the attacker attempting to hide artifacts (e.g., files, registry keys, or network connections) to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This is more relevant to the post-exploitation phase to maintain persistence and avoid detection, not to the discovery phase.

- **Answer Choice C: T1027.008-Stripped Payloads**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the attacker using stripped payloads (e.g., removing metadata or signatures) to evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: This is more relevant to the initial stages of the attack, such as the execution phase, not the discovery phase.

- **Answer Choice D: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the attacker attempting to identify active user and service accounts, including administrative accounts, to understand the network and system structure.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant to the discovery phase, as it helps the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets, including financial systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The discovery phase is characterized by the attacker's efforts to understand the target environment.
  - Exploring financial systems would require the attacker to identify relevant accounts and systems.
  - **T1087-Account Discovery** is the most relevant technique for this phase, as it helps the attacker identify the accounts and systems that are likely to be involved in financial operations.

**Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery**
