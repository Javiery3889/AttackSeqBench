### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the main component of a malware establishes communication with C&C servers, receives additional spy modules, and hides the location of the 'mothership' server. The focus is on the technique used to hide the location of the C&C server during the 'Red October' campaign.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. While it can be used to execute malicious code, it does not directly relate to hiding the location of a C&C server.

- **B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
  - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to dynamically resolve the location of a C&C server. Dead drop resolvers can use various methods, such as DNS, web services, or other protocols, to dynamically determine the C&C server's location. This technique is specifically designed to hide the location of the C&C server, making it a strong candidate.

- **C: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server. While it can be used to obfuscate the origin of traffic, it does not directly hide the location of the C&C server. It is more about routing traffic rather than dynamically resolving the server's location.

- **D: T1547.004-Winlogon Helper DLL**
  - This technique involves modifying the Winlogon Helper DLL to execute arbitrary code during the Windows logon process. It is used for persistence and does not relate to hiding the location of a C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically asks about hiding the location of the 'mothership' server.
- **T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver** is the most relevant technique because it is designed to dynamically resolve the location of a C&C server, thereby hiding its true location.
- The other techniques (T1059, T1090, and T1547.004) do not directly address the need to hide the C&C server's location.

**Final Answer: B: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
