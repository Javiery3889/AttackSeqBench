### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tropic Trooper group.
   - Initial access was gained by exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.
   - An MSI package was downloaded and installed.
   - The backdoor installer used BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting Microsoft Office vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** Downloading and installing an MSI package.
   - **Persistence and Execution:** Using BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
     - This technique involves tricking users into clicking a malicious link, which is not mentioned in the question. The initial access was through exploiting a vulnerability, not a link.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands. BITSadmin is a command-line tool, and using it to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe` aligns with this technique.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the execution flow of legitimate programs. While this could be relevant, the question specifically mentions using BITSadmin to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`, which is more aligned with command execution.
   - **D: T1558.001-Golden Ticket**
     - This technique involves creating and using Kerberos tickets to maintain long-term access. This is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves using a command-line tool (BITSadmin) to create a job and launch `sidebar.exe`. This aligns with the **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter** technique.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
