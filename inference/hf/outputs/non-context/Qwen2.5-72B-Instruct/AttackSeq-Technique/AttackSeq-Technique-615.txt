### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker:
1. Uses tools for enumerating services.
2. Authenticates via brute force.
3. Scans ports.
4. Gains initial access by remotely controlling software or creating new local accounts on internal hosts.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence of TTPs.

- **A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - **Description**: Active Scanning involves using tools to discover and map network services, identify vulnerabilities, and gather information about the target environment.
  - **Relevance**: This technique fits well with the described activities of enumerating services, scanning ports, and brute-forcing authentication. It is a common initial step in many attack sequences to gather information about the target.

- **B: T1590.001-Domain Properties**
  - **Description**: Domain Properties involves gathering information about the domain, such as domain names, domain controllers, and domain users.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for gathering information, it is more specific to domain environments and does not cover the broader activities of service enumeration, port scanning, and brute-forcing.

- **C: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - **Description**: External Proxy involves using external proxies to route traffic and mask the attacker's true location.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about maintaining anonymity and does not align with the initial reconnaissance and access activities described in the question.

- **D: T1197-BITS Jobs**
  - **Description**: BITS Jobs involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer files and maintain persistence.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about file transfer and persistence, which are typically used after gaining initial access, not for the initial reconnaissance and access activities described in the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: The attacker uses tools to enumerate services, scan ports, and brute-force authentication. This is a typical initial step in an attack to gather information about the target.
2. **Technique Alignment**: T1595-Active Scanning is the most relevant technique as it covers the activities of service enumeration, port scanning, and brute-forcing, which are all part of the initial reconnaissance phase.
3. **Other Techniques**: The other techniques (T1590.001, T1090.002, and T1197) do not align as closely with the described sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: T1595-Active Scanning**
