### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Emissary Trojan.
   - The Trojan achieved persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain.'
   - The next step in the sequence is the Trojan communicating with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The Trojan writes itself to a system directory and installs as a service.
   - **C2 Communication:** The Trojan communicates with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. While the Trojan does achieve persistence, this choice does not directly address the communication with C2 servers.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with C2 servers. This aligns well with the described communication method.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting client-side applications to execute code. This does not fit the context of the Trojan communicating with C2 servers.
   - **D: T1008-Fallback Channels**
     - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C2 channel is disrupted. While this could be relevant in a broader context, it does not directly describe the initial communication method.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique for the Trojan communicating with its C2 servers using HTTP requests is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique specifically addresses the use of common protocols like HTTP for C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
