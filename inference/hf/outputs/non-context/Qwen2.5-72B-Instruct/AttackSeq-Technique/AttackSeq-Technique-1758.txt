### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Shuckworm. Specifically, it mentions the use of VBS scripts executed via `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions, followed by the creation of persistence to ensure the backdoor is executed post-reboot.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **Bypassing Application Control**: Using VBS scripts with `mshta.exe`.
  - **Creating Persistence**: Ensuring the backdoor is executed post-reboot.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying or replacing PAM configuration files to gain persistence or privilege escalation.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of actions, which focuses on script execution and persistence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1583.004-Server**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using a server to host or distribute malicious tools or payloads.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the described sequence of actions, which focuses on script execution and persistence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1053-Scheduled Task**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a specified time or on a regular basis.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the described sequence of actions. Creating a scheduled task is a common method to ensure that a backdoor is executed post-reboot.

- **Answer Choice D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves creating or modifying system configuration settings to execute malicious code when the system boots or a user logs on.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is also highly relevant to the described sequence of actions. Creating a boot or logon autostart entry is another common method to ensure that a backdoor is executed post-reboot.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes the use of VBS scripts executed via `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions.
  - After bypassing application control, the threat actor created persistence to ensure the backdoor is executed post-reboot.
  - Both **T1053-Scheduled Task** and **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** are relevant techniques for creating persistence.
  - However, **T1053-Scheduled Task** is more specific to the scenario of creating a task that runs at a specified time or on a regular basis, which is a common method to ensure post-reboot execution.

**Final Answer: C: T1053-Scheduled Task**
