### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious XLS macro is used to download and install the SunSeed malware.
   - The malware then establishes a connection to an actor-controlled staging server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to ensure the SunSeed malware automatically runs at Windows startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Malicious XLS macro execution.
   - **Malware Installation:** Download and installation of SunSeed malware.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Establishment of a connection to the actor-controlled staging server.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware runs at Windows startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1055.001-Dynamic-link Library Injection:**
     - This technique involves injecting code into a running process to execute arbitrary code. It is not typically used for ensuring malware runs at startup.
   - **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves various methods to ensure that a program runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. It is not relevant to ensuring malware runs at startup.
   - **D: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves manipulating the system's search order to execute a malicious program instead of a legitimate one. While it can be used for persistence, it is less common and more specific than the broader T1547 technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring the malware runs at Windows startup.
   - T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) is the most relevant technique for this purpose.
   - T1547 includes various sub-techniques such as Registry Run Keys, Scheduled Tasks, and Service Creation, all of which are commonly used to achieve persistence.
   - The other techniques (A, C, and D) do not directly address the requirement of ensuring the malware runs at startup.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
