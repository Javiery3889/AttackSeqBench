### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials were used to compromise Japanese companies in various sectors. The task is to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not typically a technique used after the initial compromise with backdoors and hardcoded credentials.

- **B: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
  - This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This is a more advanced technique and is not typically a direct follow-up to the initial compromise with backdoors and hardcoded credentials.

- **C: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This is a duplicate of answer choice A and can be disregarded.

- **D: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic. Given that the backdoors have hardcoded proxy addresses, it is logical that the attackers would use these proxies to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data. This technique aligns well with the described scenario.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial compromise involved second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.
2. The use of hardcoded proxy addresses suggests that the attackers intended to route their network traffic through these proxies.
3. The most logical next step after the initial compromise would be to use these proxies to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
4. Among the given choices, T1090-Proxy is the most relevant and plausible technique that would follow the initial compromise.

**Final Answer: D: T1090-Proxy**
