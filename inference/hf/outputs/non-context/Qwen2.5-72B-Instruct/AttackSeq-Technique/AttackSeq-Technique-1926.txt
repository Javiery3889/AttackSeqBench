### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The FriarFox malicious Firefox browser extension is delivered via a phishing email and is used to establish defense evasion capabilities. The extension then contacts a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Phishing email (initial delivery)
  - Defense evasion (establishing capabilities)
  - Contacting a server to retrieve a payload

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. While it is possible that the communication to the server is encrypted, the question does not specifically mention encryption.

- **Answer Choice B: T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material**
  - This technique involves using stolen credentials or alternate authentication methods to gain access to systems. The question does not mention any use of stolen credentials or alternate authentication methods.

- **Answer Choice C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a server. The question mentions that the extension contacts a server to retrieve a payload, which is a typical use case for application layer protocols.

- **Answer Choice D: T1563 - Remote Service Session Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking an existing session to gain unauthorized access. The question does not mention any session hijacking.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question describes a sequence where the malicious extension contacts a server to retrieve a payload. This communication is likely to use a common application layer protocol to establish the connection and transfer the payload.
  - The most relevant technique for this step is T1071 - Application Layer Protocol, as it directly aligns with the described action of the extension contacting a server.

**Final Answer: C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
