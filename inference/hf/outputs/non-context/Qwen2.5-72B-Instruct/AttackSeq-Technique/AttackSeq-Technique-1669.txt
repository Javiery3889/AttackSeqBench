### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the SocGholish framework is used to deliver the initial payload via compromised legitimate websites. The next step in the sequence is the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts that come with software, systems, or services. While this can be a method for gaining initial access, it is not typically associated with the use of a framework like SocGholish, which is more about delivering malware through compromised websites.

- **B: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While it can be used during the execution phase, it is not a common initial step before deploying a payload like Cobalt Strike Beacon.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to trick users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments. However, the question specifically mentions the use of the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites, which is a different method of initial access.

- **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forking to hide data or code within a file. While it can be used for stealth, it is not a common initial step before deploying a payload like Cobalt Strike Beacon.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: After gaining initial access, the attackers deploy the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for execution.

The technique that most likely occurred before the deployment of the Cobalt Strike Beacon is the initial access method, which in this case is the use of the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites. However, the question is asking for the ATT&CK technique that fits this context.

The most relevant technique from the given choices is **T1566-Phishing**, even though the question specifies the use of compromised websites. Phishing can be a broader term that includes various methods of tricking users, including through compromised websites.

However, since the question specifically mentions the use of compromised websites, the most accurate and relevant technique would be **T1566.002-Drive-by Compromise**, which is a sub-technique of T1566-Phishing. Unfortunately, this sub-technique is not listed in the answer choices.

Given the choices provided, the closest and most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
