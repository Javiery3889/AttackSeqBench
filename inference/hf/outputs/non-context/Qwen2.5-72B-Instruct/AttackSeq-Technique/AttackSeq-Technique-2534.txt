### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the LURK malware.
   - The malware maintained persistence by creating a link in the Startup folder and using files in the %AppData%\Help directory.
   - The malware then communicated with its command-and-control (C2) server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves hiding the true nature of files or information to evade detection. While obfuscation might be used in various stages of an attack, it is not specifically related to the communication with a C2 server using dynamic DNS and specific ports.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1132-Data Encoding**
     - This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable. While encoding can be used in communication, it is not the primary technique for establishing communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. Dynamic DNS and specific ports are typical components of this technique, as they are used to establish and maintain communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1499.001-OS Exhaustion Flood**
     - This technique involves overwhelming the operating system with requests to cause a denial of service. This is not related to the communication with a C2 server.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The malware maintained persistence and then communicated with its C2 server using dynamic DNS domains and specific ports. This communication is a clear example of using standard application layer protocols to establish and maintain communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is the one that describes the use of application layer protocols.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
