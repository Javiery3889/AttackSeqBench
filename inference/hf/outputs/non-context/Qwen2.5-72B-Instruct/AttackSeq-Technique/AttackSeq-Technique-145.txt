### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where the Phosphorus group exploited Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities for initial access. After gaining access, they used scheduled tasks and Registry RunKeys for persistence. The question asks which ATT&CK technique was used to execute commands and download additional payloads via the PowerLess Backdoor.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities.
  - Persistence: Scheduled tasks and Registry RunKeys.
  - Execution of commands and downloading additional payloads via PowerLess Backdoor.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain access to a compromised system.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for maintaining access, it does not directly relate to executing commands or downloading payloads.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053.002-At**
  - **Description**: This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command to execute commands at a specified time.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about scheduling tasks for persistence, not directly executing commands or downloading payloads.

- **Answer Choice C: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering system and domain accounts.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used for reconnaissance and does not directly relate to executing commands or downloading payloads.

- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and download additional payloads.
  - **Relevance**: This technique directly aligns with the need to execute commands and download additional payloads, which is the focus of the question.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The Phosphorus group exploited Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: They used scheduled tasks and Registry RunKeys to maintain persistence.
3. **Execution and Payload Download**: To execute commands and download additional payloads, they used the PowerLess Backdoor, which is a command and scripting interpreter.

Given the context, the most plausible technique for executing commands and downloading additional payloads via the PowerLess Backdoor is **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**.

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
