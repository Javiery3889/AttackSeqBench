### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. The next step involves the execution of a PowerShell script that delivers payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Initial Access: Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
  - Execution: PowerShell script.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves scheduling a task using container orchestration tools, which is not typically associated with the execution of a PowerShell script in the context of phishing and malware delivery.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the described attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which is a step that might occur before initial access but not after it.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the described attack sequence, as the initial access has already been achieved.

- **Answer Choice C: T1552.003-Bash History**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves stealing or accessing the Bash history file, which is not typically associated with the execution of a PowerShell script in a Windows environment.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the described attack sequence.

- **Answer Choice D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting languages to execute commands and scripts, which is directly relevant to the execution of a PowerShell script.
  - **Evaluation**: Highly relevant to the described attack sequence, as the PowerShell script is the next step after initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
2. **Execution**: The next step involves the execution of a PowerShell script to deliver the payloads.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The technique that most likely occurred before the PowerShell script executed the payloads is the use of a command and scripting interpreter (T1059).

**Final Answer: D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
