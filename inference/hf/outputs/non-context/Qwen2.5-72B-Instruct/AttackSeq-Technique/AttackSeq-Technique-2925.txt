### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT41.
   - APT41 used rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence.
   - These techniques execute before the operating system initializes.
   - After these techniques, APT41 accessed credentials within the compromised systems using keyloggers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence and Stealth:**
     - Rootkits and MBR bootkits are used for persistence and to execute before the operating system initializes.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Keyloggers are used to access credentials within the compromised systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1213.005-Messaging Applications:**
     - This technique involves using messaging applications to exfiltrate data or communicate with the command and control server. It does not align with the sequence of persistence and stealth followed by credential access.
   - **B: T1497.003-Time Based Evasion:**
     - This technique involves evading detection by timing the execution of malicious activities. While it can be used for stealth, it does not specifically relate to the sequence of using rootkits and MBR bootkits followed by keyloggers.
   - **C: T1610-Deploy Container:**
     - This technique involves deploying containers to run malicious code. It is not directly related to the sequence of persistence and stealth followed by credential access.
   - **D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot:**
     - This technique involves modifying the boot process to execute malicious code before the operating system initializes. This aligns perfectly with the use of rootkits and MBR bootkits for persistence and stealth.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT41 used T1542-Pre-OS Boot to achieve persistence and stealth before accessing credentials with keyloggers.

**Final Answer: D: T1542-Pre-OS Boot**
