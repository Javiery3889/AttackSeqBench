### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker bypasses environment-based checks, such as a 'CPU core check' to detect virtualization.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to ensure that the implanted Remote Access Tool (RAT) can execute upon system startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
     - This technique involves manipulating network protocols to redirect traffic to the attacker's machine. It is not related to ensuring persistence or execution upon system startup.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that a program (in this case, the RAT) runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This aligns well with the requirement to ensure the RAT executes upon system startup.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1608-Stage Capabilities**
     - This technique involves breaking down the attack into stages, where each stage is delivered or activated at different times. While this can be part of a broader attack strategy, it does not specifically address the need for persistence or execution upon system startup.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1542.003-Bootkit**
     - This technique involves modifying the boot process to gain control before the operating system loads. While this can ensure persistence, it is a more advanced and complex method typically used for highly sophisticated attacks. It is not the most common or straightforward method for ensuring a RAT executes upon system startup.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks for a technique to ensure the RAT executes upon system startup.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most relevant and common technique for achieving this goal.
   - The other techniques (A, C, and D) do not directly address the need for persistence or execution upon system startup.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
