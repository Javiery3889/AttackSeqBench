### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Agrius to ensure command execution and minimize detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. 

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services such as SSH, RDP, or VNC to gain access to a system. While this can be used for command execution, it does not directly address minimizing detection or maintaining persistence.

- **B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise (IOCs) to avoid detection. This is a common post-exploitation technique to minimize detection, but it does not directly address command execution.

- **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the memory of a process by using the extra window memory (EWM) mechanism. This can be used to execute commands and maintain persistence while minimizing detection by avoiding writing to disk.

- **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
  - This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often through legitimate system processes or services. This can help in minimizing detection but does not directly address maintaining persistence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence with 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor**: The question states that Agrius has already achieved persistence using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. This backdoor likely provides a persistent method for the attacker to maintain access to the system.
2. **Command Execution and Minimizing Detection**: The next step is to ensure that commands can be executed and that the attacker's activities are minimized to avoid detection.
3. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **A: T1021-Remote Services** is not the best fit because it does not address minimizing detection.
   - **B: T1070-Indicator Removal** is a good fit for minimizing detection but does not directly address command execution.
   - **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection** is a strong fit because it allows for command execution in memory, which helps in maintaining persistence and minimizing detection.
   - **D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution** is also a good fit for minimizing detection but does not directly address maintaining persistence.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is **C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection**. This technique allows for command execution in memory, which is both persistent and minimizes detection.

### Final Answer: C: T1055.011-Extra Window Memory Injection
