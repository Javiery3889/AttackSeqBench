### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where a batch script is used to deploy an RMS client via a Self-Extracting Archive (SFX). The next step in the attack involves maintaining the presence by modifying system startup configurations.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Execution of a batch script.
  - Deployment of an RMS client via SFX.
  - Modifying system startup configurations to maintain persistence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
  - **Description**: This technique involves an adversary tricking a user into visiting a website that contains malicious content, leading to the execution of code on the user's system.
  - **Relevance**: This does not fit the context of the question, as the attack sequence involves a batch script and SFX, not a drive-by compromise.

- **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying the system's boot or logon processes to ensure that malicious code is executed automatically when the system starts or a user logs in.
  - **Relevance**: This fits the context of the question, as modifying system startup configurations is a common method to maintain persistence.

- **Answer Choice C: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting unquoted service paths to execute arbitrary code when a service is started.
  - **Relevance**: This does not fit the context of the question, as the attack sequence involves modifying startup configurations, not exploiting unquoted paths.

- **Answer Choice D: T1204-User Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing malicious code, often through social engineering.
  - **Relevance**: This does not fit the context of the question, as the attack sequence involves automated execution via a batch script and SFX, not user interaction.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Context Analysis**: The attack sequence involves deploying an RMS client via a batch script and SFX, followed by modifying system startup configurations to maintain persistence.
2. **Technique Evaluation**:
   - **T1189-Drive-by Compromise**: Not relevant as it involves user interaction with a malicious website.
   - **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: Highly relevant as it involves modifying startup configurations to ensure persistence.
   - **T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path**: Not relevant as it involves exploiting unquoted paths.
   - **T1204-User Execution**: Not relevant as it involves user interaction, not automated execution.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
