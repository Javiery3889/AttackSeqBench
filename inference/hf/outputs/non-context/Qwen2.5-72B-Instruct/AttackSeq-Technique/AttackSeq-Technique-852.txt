### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group TG-3279.
   - TG-3279 reused network infrastructure by sharing IPs among domain names.
   - They gained initial access using tools 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Reusing network infrastructure (sharing IPs among domain names).
   - Gaining initial access using scanning and exploitation tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: T1596.001-DNS/Passive DNS**
     - This technique involves collecting DNS records to identify and track infrastructure. While it could be used to gather information about the network, it is not directly related to the initial access or the reuse of infrastructure.

   - **B: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure**
     - This technique involves obtaining resources such as domain names, servers, and IP addresses. This could be relevant to the reuse of network infrastructure, but it does not directly lead to the initial access using scanning and exploitation tools.

   - **C: T1595-Active Scanning**
     - This technique involves using tools to scan for vulnerabilities and open ports. This aligns well with the use of 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation, which are typical actions taken before gaining initial access.

   - **D: T1558-Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets**
     - This technique involves stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to gain access to network resources. This is more relevant to post-compromise activities and does not fit the context of initial access using scanning and exploitation tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The reuse of network infrastructure (sharing IPs among domain names) suggests that TG-3279 had already acquired the necessary infrastructure.
   - The next logical step would be to scan the network to identify vulnerabilities and open ports.
   - The use of 's' and 'rdp_crk' for scanning and exploitation indicates that active scanning was performed before gaining initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1595-Active Scanning
