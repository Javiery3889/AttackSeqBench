### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving a phishing email, a CAB archive, and the BlackSoul malware.
   - The sequence is as follows:
     1. Phishing email delivered a CAB archive impersonating a document from the NIST website.
     2. BlackSoul malware evaded defenses using dynamic string construction and cipher-based deobfuscation.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media**
     - This technique involves using removable media to spread malware. It is not typically used in the context of a phishing email and CAB archive.
   - **B: T1591.004-Identify Roles**
     - This technique involves identifying roles within an organization, which is more of a reconnaissance activity and does not fit the context of the sequence described.
   - **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This would typically occur after the malware has been executed and established a foothold, not immediately after the CAB archive is delivered.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - This technique involves the use of phishing to deliver malware. The question already mentions that a phishing email delivered the CAB archive, so this technique is already part of the initial step.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves a phishing email delivering a CAB archive, which is then followed by the BlackSoul malware evading defenses.
   - The most plausible technique that would occur between the delivery of the CAB archive and the evasion of defenses is the execution of the malware.
   - However, the question does not explicitly mention the execution of the malware, but it is implied that the CAB archive contains the malware that will be executed.
   - Given the options, the most plausible technique that fits the sequence is the initial delivery mechanism, which is already covered by the phishing email (T1566).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
