### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the LURK malware.
   - The sequence includes gaining initial access via socially engineered emails, connecting to a command-and-control (C2) server, and using a backup domain for communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gaining initial access via socially engineered emails.
   - **C2 Communication:** Connecting to a C2 server.
   - **Backup Domain:** Using a backup domain for communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1561-Disk Wipe**
     - Disk wipe is a technique used to destroy data on a disk, typically as a form of data destruction or to prevent forensic analysis. This technique is not typically used before gaining initial access or setting up C2 communication.
   - **B: T1659-Content Injection**
     - Content injection involves inserting malicious content into legitimate web pages or applications. This technique is not directly related to gaining initial access via emails or setting up C2 communication.
   - **C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - Boot or logon autostart execution is used to ensure that malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This technique is often used after gaining initial access to maintain persistence, but it is not typically the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **D: T1566-Phishing**
     - Phishing is a technique used to gain initial access by tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments in emails. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence, where initial access is gained via socially engineered emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the LURK malware used phishing (T1566) to gain initial access before connecting to the C2 server and using a backup domain for communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
