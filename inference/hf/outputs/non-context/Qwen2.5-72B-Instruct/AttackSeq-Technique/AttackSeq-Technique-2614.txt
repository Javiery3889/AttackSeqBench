### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already gained maximum privileges on a Windows machine through a local privilege escalation exploit. The next step in the attack sequence is to maintain access on the victim’s machine. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to be used for this purpose.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing is a technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as credentials. It is typically used in the initial access phase of an attack, not for maintaining access after gaining maximum privileges.

- **B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - Scheduled Task/Job is a technique where attackers create or modify scheduled tasks or jobs to execute their tools or scripts at a specific time or under certain conditions. This is a common method for maintaining persistence on a victim’s machine.

- **C: T1098-Account Manipulation**
  - Account Manipulation involves modifying existing accounts or creating new ones to maintain access. This can include changing account passwords, adding new accounts, or elevating account privileges. While this can be used for maintaining access, it is more about gaining and maintaining control over accounts rather than ensuring persistent access.

- **D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - Cloud Accounts is a technique where attackers use valid credentials to access cloud services. This is more relevant to cloud environments and not typically used for maintaining access on a local Windows machine.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1:** The attacker has already gained maximum privileges on the Windows machine.
- **Step 2:** The next logical step is to ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the machine.
- **Step 3:** Among the given options, **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job** is the most appropriate technique for maintaining persistence. It allows the attacker to set up a mechanism that will automatically execute their tools or scripts, ensuring they can regain access even if the machine is rebooted or the current session is terminated.

**Final Answer: B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
