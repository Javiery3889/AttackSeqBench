### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NewsBeef malware. Specifically, it mentions:
- **Obfuscated JavaScript injection** to evade detection.
- **Maintaining server persistence**.
- **Communication between the Pupy backdoor and the command and control (C2) server**.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1071.002-File Transfer Protocols**
  - This technique involves using file transfer protocols (e.g., FTP, SFTP) to exfiltrate data or transfer files. While it could be used in an attack, it is not specifically about communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

- **B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - This technique involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target. It is not relevant to the communication between a backdoor and a C2 server.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a common method for maintaining communication in a stealthy manner, which aligns well with the described scenario.

- **D: T1574.004-Dylib Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking dynamic libraries to execute malicious code. While it can be used for persistence, it is not related to communication with a C2 server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Obfuscated JavaScript Injection**: This technique is used to evade detection by security software.
2. **Maintaining Server Persistence**: This ensures that the malware remains active and can re-establish itself if it is removed.
3. **Communication with C2 Server**: The Pupy backdoor needs to communicate with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

Given the need for communication between the Pupy backdoor and the C2 server, the most plausible technique is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**. This technique allows the malware to use common protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the C2 server in a way that is less likely to be detected by network security measures.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
