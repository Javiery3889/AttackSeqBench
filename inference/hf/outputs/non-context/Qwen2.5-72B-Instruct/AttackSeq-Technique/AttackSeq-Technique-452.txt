### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where attackers disguised North Korean fundraising apps to avoid suspicion and distributed them to gain access to victims.
- **Key TTPs**: The focus is on the distribution method used to gain initial access to the victims' systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access.
  - **Evaluation**: This does not fit the scenario well because the question does not mention any exploitation of a vulnerability in a public-facing application. Instead, it focuses on the distribution of a malicious app.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566 - Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking victims into clicking on a link or opening an attachment that contains malware.
  - **Evaluation**: This fits the scenario well because phishing is a common method for distributing malicious apps. The attackers could have used phishing emails or messages to trick victims into downloading the disguised fundraising apps.

- **Answer Choice C: T1564 - Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is more about post-compromise activities to avoid detection, not the initial distribution of the malicious app.

- **Answer Choice D: T1037.004 - RC Scripts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying or creating RC (Resource Configuration) scripts to execute malicious code.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is more about persistence and execution of malicious code, not the initial distribution of the app.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question focuses on the initial distribution method of the malicious app.
  - Phishing (T1566) is a common and effective method for distributing malicious apps by tricking victims into downloading them.
  - The other techniques (T1190, T1564, T1037.004) do not align as well with the initial distribution phase described in the question.

**Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing**
