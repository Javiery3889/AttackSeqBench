### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where APT41:
1. Moved laterally within targeted networks.
2. Pivoted between Windows and Linux systems.
3. Collected source code and digital certificates from game production environments.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before these actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories such as databases, file shares, and other data storage systems. While this could be part of the data collection phase, it is not typically a prerequisite for lateral movement or pivoting between systems.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is often used for reconnaissance or to gather information about the target environment. However, it is not a necessary step for lateral movement or pivoting between systems.

- **C: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting malicious content into legitimate content, often to manipulate or control the target. This is more relevant to the exploitation phase and is not typically a prerequisite for lateral movement or pivoting.

- **D: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access to a target network. Phishing is a common initial access vector that can provide the attacker with the necessary credentials or foothold to start moving laterally within the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker needs to gain initial access to the network. Phishing (T1566) is a common method for achieving this.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Once inside the network, the attacker can move laterally to other systems, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.
3. **Data Collection**: After gaining access to the desired systems, the attacker can collect source code and digital certificates from game production environments.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before the described actions is **T1566-Phishing**.

**Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing**
