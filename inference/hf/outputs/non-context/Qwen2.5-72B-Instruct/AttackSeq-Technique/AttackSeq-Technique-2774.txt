### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Dragonfly attackers:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
2. **Transition to Gaining Access**: After gathering information, the attackers move to gain access to the victim network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering system and application accounts that can be used to gain further access or privileges.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used after gaining initial access to the network to identify potential targets for privilege escalation or lateral movement. It does not fit the initial phase of gaining access.

- **B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sending spear-phishing emails to gain access to victim systems.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is part of the reconnaissance phase and is used to gather information and gain initial access. However, the question states that the attackers have already used phishing as part of their reconnaissance methods.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This is the same as option B.
  - **Relevance**: Same as option B.

- **D: T1585.002-Email Accounts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising email accounts to gain access to sensitive information and potentially to use these accounts for further attacks.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is a logical next step after gaining initial access through reconnaissance methods. Compromising email accounts can provide a foothold in the network and allow the attackers to gather more information or move laterally.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where the attackers have already used reconnaissance methods (spear-phishing, watering holes, and supply-chain exploits) to gather information.
2. The next logical step after reconnaissance and initial information gathering is to gain access to the victim network.
3. Among the given options, **T1585.002-Email Accounts** (compromising email accounts) is the most plausible next step. This technique allows the attackers to gain a foothold in the network and potentially use the compromised accounts for further attacks.

**Final Answer: D: T1585.002-Email Accounts**
