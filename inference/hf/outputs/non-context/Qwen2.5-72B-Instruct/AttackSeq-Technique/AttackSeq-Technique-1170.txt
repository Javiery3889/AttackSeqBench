### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After setting up communication with C&C servers utilizing a custom cryptographic protocol, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred during Longhorn's external communication process to maintain operational security and avoid detection?
- **Key Points**:
  - Communication with C&C servers
  - Custom cryptographic protocol
  - Maintaining operational security and avoiding detection

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1027.011-Fileless Storage**: This technique involves storing data in memory or other non-persistent locations to avoid detection. While this can be used to maintain operational security, it is not directly related to external communication or encryption.
  - **B: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This technique involves transferring data at specific times to avoid detection. While it can help in maintaining operational security, it does not directly address the use of a custom cryptographic protocol for communication.
  - **C: T1029-Scheduled Transfer**: This is the same as B, so it can be considered redundant.
  - **D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission. This directly aligns with the use of a custom cryptographic protocol to maintain operational security and avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions the use of a custom cryptographic protocol to maintain operational security and avoid detection during external communication with C&C servers.
  - **T1573-Encrypted Channel** is the most relevant technique because it directly involves the use of encryption to protect data during transmission, which is exactly what a custom cryptographic protocol would achieve.
  - **T1027.011-Fileless Storage** and **T1029-Scheduled Transfer** do not directly address the use of encryption for external communication, even though they can contribute to operational security in other ways.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
