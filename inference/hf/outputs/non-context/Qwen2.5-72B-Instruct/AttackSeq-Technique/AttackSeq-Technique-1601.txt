### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where FastPOS, a point-of-sale (PoS) malware, uploads stolen information (logged keystrokes and RAM scraper data) to a C&C server using GET commands. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this exfiltration step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1052-Exfiltration Over Physical Medium**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using physical methods, such as USB drives or other removable media. This does not align with the described scenario, which involves network-based exfiltration using GET commands.

- **B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes. This is a plausible step that would occur before exfiltration, as the malware would need to capture the keystrokes and other data before uploading it.

- **C: T1218.011-Rundll32**
  - This technique involves using the rundll32 utility to execute code. While this could be part of the malware's initial infection or execution process, it is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel. This is the step that is described in the question, where the data is uploaded to the C&C server using GET commands. However, we are looking for the step that occurred before this exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Exfiltration Over Physical Medium (T1052)**: This does not fit the scenario as the exfiltration is network-based.
2. **Input Capture (T1056)**: This is a logical step that would occur before exfiltration, as the malware needs to capture the data before it can be uploaded.
3. **Rundll32 (T1218.011)**: This is not directly related to the exfiltration process.
4. **Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)**: This is the step described in the question, not the step before it.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred before the exfiltration of data is **Input Capture (T1056)**.

### Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture
