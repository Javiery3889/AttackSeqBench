### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a backdoor function has already gathered machine information during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves further extracting visual data from the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - **Description:** This technique involves capturing the contents of the victim's screen, which is a form of visual data.
     - **Relevance:** This is highly relevant because it directly involves extracting visual data from the victim's system, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1588.006-Vulnerabilities**
     - **Description:** This technique involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the victim's system.
     - **Relevance:** This is not relevant to the extraction of visual data. It is more about identifying weaknesses to further compromise the system.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1102-Web Service**
     - **Description:** This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.
     - **Relevance:** This is not relevant to the extraction of visual data. It is more about communication and data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1213.001-Confluence**
     - **Description:** This technique involves using Confluence, a collaboration tool, to store and exfiltrate data.
     - **Relevance:** This is not relevant to the extraction of visual data. It is more about using a specific tool for data storage and exfiltration.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifies that the next step involves extracting visual data from the victim's system.
   - Among the given choices, only T1113-Screen Capture directly involves capturing visual data.
   - The other choices (T1588.006-Vulnerabilities, T1102-Web Service, and T1213.001-Confluence) do not align with the requirement of extracting visual data.

**Final Answer: A: T1113-Screen Capture**
