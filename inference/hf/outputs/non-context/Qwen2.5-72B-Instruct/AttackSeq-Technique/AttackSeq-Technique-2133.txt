### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events involving the execution of heavily obfuscated scripts like 'install.vbs' and the subsequent deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' by 'stopedge.bat'.
- We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the deletion of these files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1124-System Time Discovery**: This technique involves an adversary discovering the system time, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the deletion of files.
- **T1553.001-Gatekeeper Bypass**: This technique involves bypassing security mechanisms, which is not directly related to the execution of scripts or the deletion of files.
- **T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**: This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands. This is highly relevant to the execution of 'install.vbs' and the subsequent operations.
- **T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is relevant to the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Execution of 'install.vbs'**: The execution of 'install.vbs' is a scripting operation, which aligns with T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
2. **Deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'**: The deletion of these files is an indicator removal activity, which aligns with T1070-Indicator Removal.
3. **Sequence of Events**: The execution of 'install.vbs' (T1059) would logically occur before the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' (T1070).

### Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
