### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the POWERSHOWER malware:
1. It collected system information.
2. It transmitted the collected information to the C2 (Command and Control) server.
3. It entered a communications loop by utilizing a proxy.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - This technique involves using multiple proxies to route traffic, which can be used to obfuscate the origin of the traffic. While this could be part of the communication loop, it is more specific and not necessarily the most likely step before entering the loop.

- **B: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route traffic, which is a general method to obfuscate the origin of the traffic. This aligns well with the step of entering a communications loop by utilizing a proxy.

- **C: T1056.002-GUI Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input from the graphical user interface, which is not related to the communication loop or proxy usage. It is more relevant to credential harvesting or keylogging.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence of actions described, which are more focused on post-compromise activities.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The sequence of actions described involves collecting system information, transmitting it to the C2 server, and then entering a communications loop using a proxy.
2. The most relevant technique for the step of entering a communications loop by utilizing a proxy is T1090-Proxy.
3. The other techniques (T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy, T1056.002-GUI Input Capture, and T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) do not align as closely with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: B: T1090-Proxy**
