### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Mustang Panda threat group. Specifically, it mentions that Mustang Panda used execution methods involving benign executables to side-load malicious DLLs for deploying the PlugX implant. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial execution method.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute code at system boot or user logon. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate or direct follow-up to side-loading a malicious DLL.

- **B: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**
  - This technique involves executing scripts during a network logon. This is less likely to be a direct follow-up to side-loading a DLL, as it is more about persistence and execution at logon.

- **C: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
  - This technique involves modifying shortcuts to execute malicious code. While this could be used for persistence, it is not the most immediate or direct follow-up to side-loading a DLL.

- **D: T1129-Shared Modules**
  - This technique involves using shared modules (DLLs) to load and execute malicious code. This is directly related to the side-loading of malicious DLLs, as it describes the mechanism by which the malicious DLL is loaded and executed.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution Method**: Mustang Panda used benign executables to side-load malicious DLLs.
2. **Immediate Follow-Up**: The most immediate and direct follow-up to side-loading a malicious DLL is the execution of that DLL.
3. **Relevant Technique**: T1129-Shared Modules is the technique that describes the use of shared modules (DLLs) to load and execute malicious code.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after side-loading the malicious DLL, the next step is the execution of the DLL itself, which is described by T1129-Shared Modules.

**Final Answer: D: T1129-Shared Modules**
