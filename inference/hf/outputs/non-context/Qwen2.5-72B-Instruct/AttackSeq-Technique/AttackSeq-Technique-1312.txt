### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where APT34 has established persistence using a scheduled task named 'windows update check' that runs the file `System Manager.exe` every minute. The goal is to determine which ATT&CK technique facilitated APT34's ability to maintain communication with the C2 domain `offlineearthquake[.]com`.
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Persistence**: Scheduled task named 'windows update check' running `System Manager.exe` every minute.
  - **C2 Communication**: Maintaining communication with the C2 domain `offlineearthquake[.]com`.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1090-Proxy**
  - **Description**: Use of a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to mask the true origin of the traffic or to bypass network restrictions. While it can be used for C2 communication, it is not directly related to maintaining communication with a specific C2 domain.

- **Answer Choice B: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - **Description**: Stealing credentials from password stores to gain unauthorized access.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to gain access to systems or accounts but does not directly facilitate C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice C: T1080-Taint Shared Content**
  - **Description**: Modifying shared content to include malicious code or data.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to spread malware or to maintain persistence by infecting shared resources. It does not directly facilitate C2 communication.

- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Description**: Using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is directly related to maintaining communication with a C2 server. It involves using common protocols to send and receive data, which is essential for C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence**: APT34 has established persistence using a scheduled task that runs `System Manager.exe` every minute. This ensures that the malware is executed regularly.
2. **C2 Communication**: To maintain communication with the C2 domain `offlineearthquake[.]com`, the malware needs a way to send and receive data.
3. **Relevance of T1071-Application Layer Protocol**:
   - **HTTP/HTTPS**: These protocols are commonly used for C2 communication because they are less likely to be blocked by firewalls and can blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **DNS**: This protocol can also be used for C2 communication, especially for domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or to resolve C2 domains.

Given the context of maintaining communication with a specific C2 domain, the most plausible technique is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
