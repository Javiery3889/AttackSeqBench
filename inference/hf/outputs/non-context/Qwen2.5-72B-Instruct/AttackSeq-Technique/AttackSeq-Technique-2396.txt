### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first performs discovery activities to collect host and network information.
- After the discovery, the malware starts communicating with compromised websites in South Korea and Europe to exfiltrate data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using legitimate protocols to encapsulate and tunnel malicious traffic. While it can be used for exfiltration, it is not the most direct match for the described scenario.
- **T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique is related to hijacking the .NET AppDomainManager to execute arbitrary code. It is not directly related to exfiltration or communication with external websites.
- **T1591-Gather Victim Org Information**: This technique involves collecting information about the victim organization, which is more aligned with the initial discovery phase rather than the exfiltration phase.
- **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or to exfiltrate data. This is a common method for securely transmitting data to external servers, which aligns well with the described scenario of communicating with compromised websites to exfiltrate data.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Discovery Phase**: The malware performs discovery activities to collect host and network information. This is a common initial step in many attack sequences.
2. **Exfiltration Phase**: After collecting the necessary information, the malware starts communicating with compromised websites in South Korea and Europe to exfiltrate data. This communication is likely to be secure to avoid detection.
3. **Encrypted Channel (T1573)**: The use of encrypted channels is a common technique for securely exfiltrating data. It aligns well with the described scenario of communicating with external websites to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
