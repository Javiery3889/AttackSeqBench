### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of TTPs used in Operation Pawn Storm, where multistage downloaders and phishing websites were used to redirect targets to fake OWA (Outlook Web Access) log-in pages for credential harvesting.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Multistage downloaders
  - Phishing websites
  - Fake OWA log-in pages
  - Credential harvesting

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a remote system. It is not directly related to capturing credentials from user input.
- **Answer Choice B: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to steal credentials. This aligns well with the scenario of logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
- **Answer Choice C: T1573.001-Symmetric Cryptography**
  - This technique involves using symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. It is not directly related to capturing credentials from user input.
- **Answer Choice D: T1110.003-Password Spraying**
  - This technique involves using a single password against many accounts to gain access. It is not related to capturing credentials from user input on fake log-in pages.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions that credentials were captured by logging victim input on fake OWA log-in pages.
  - The technique that best fits this description is **T1056-Input Capture**, as it involves capturing user input, which is exactly what is happening on the fake OWA log-in pages.
  - The other techniques (T1071, T1573.001, and T1110.003) do not directly relate to the act of capturing user input for credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture**
