### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of events involving the execution of the XAgent malware on iOS 7. The malware hides the app icon, automatically restarts, and then collects and sends information like contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status to a command and control (C2) server.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Hiding the app icon
  - Automatically restarting
  - Collecting information (contact lists, text messages, Wi-Fi status)
  - Sending collected information to a C2 server

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1057-Process Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves identifying running processes on a system.
  - **Relevance**: While process discovery might be useful for the malware to understand the environment, it is not a necessary step before collecting and sending information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1204-User Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking a user into executing a malicious file or link.
  - **Relevance**: This is a plausible initial step for the malware to gain execution on the device. The user might have been tricked into installing the app, which then executes the malware.

- **Answer Choice C: T1012-Query Registry**
  - **Description**: This technique involves querying the Windows registry to gather information about the system.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to Windows systems and is not applicable to iOS.

- **Answer Choice D: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to gain persistence or elevate privileges.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to Unix-based systems and is not applicable to iOS.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Execution**: The malware must first be executed on the device. This is likely achieved through user interaction, such as tricking the user into installing the app.
2. **Hiding and Restarting**: Once executed, the malware hides the app icon and sets up automatic restarts to maintain persistence.
3. **Information Collection**: The malware then collects information like contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status.
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Finally, the collected information is sent to the C2 server.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible initial step is the user being tricked into executing the malware.

**Final Answer: B: T1204-User Execution**
