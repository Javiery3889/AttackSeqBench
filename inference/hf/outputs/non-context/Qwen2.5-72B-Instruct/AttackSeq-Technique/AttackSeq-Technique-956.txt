### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have achieved system-level access by leveraging vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956).
   - After gaining this access, the attackers implemented Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with their C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Elevation of Privilege:** Leveraging vulnerabilities to gain system-level access.
   - **Stager:** A component that downloads and executes additional malware.
   - **Dropper:** A component that installs and runs the main payload.
   - **Remote Shell:** A component that allows the attackers to control the compromised system remotely.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels:** This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and control over a compromised system. This aligns well with the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with the C&C server.
   - **B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification:** This technique involves changing file and directory permissions to gain access or hide malicious activities. While this could be part of the attack, it does not directly align with the described sequence of using Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.
   - **C: T1566-Phishing:** This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious actions. This does not align with the described sequence, as the question focuses on post-exploitation activities.
   - **D: T1132.001-Standard Encoding:** This technique involves encoding data to evade detection. While encoding could be used in the communication with the C&C server, it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the use of multiple communication channels to maintain control over the compromised system, which is best described by T1104-Multi-Stage Channels.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
