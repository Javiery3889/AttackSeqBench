### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by Hidden Cobra, a known threat actor.
- **Sequence of TTPs**:
  1. Registered the malicious domain falcancoin.io.
  2. Distributed Bankshot implants.
  3. Targeted financial organizations in Turkey with spear phishing emails containing a malicious document.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1566-Phishing**: This technique involves sending spear phishing emails, which is mentioned in the question as the final step.
  - **B: T1555.004-Asynchronous Procedure Call**: This technique involves using asynchronous procedure calls to execute code, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
  - **C: T1586.002-Email Accounts**: This technique involves compromising email accounts, which could be a step in the attack but is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence.
  - **D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**: This technique involves developing or acquiring tools and capabilities, which could logically occur after registering a domain and distributing implants but before targeting organizations.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Registering the Malicious Domain**: Hidden Cobra registered the domain falcancoin.io.
2. **Distributing Bankshot Implants**: They distributed Bankshot implants, which are likely part of their toolkit or capabilities.
3. **Developing Capabilities**: Before targeting financial organizations, Hidden Cobra would need to ensure they have the necessary tools and capabilities in place. This aligns with the T1587-Develop Capabilities technique.
4. **Targeting Financial Organizations**: Finally, they targeted financial organizations in Turkey with spear phishing emails containing a malicious document, which is the T1566-Phishing technique.

**Final Answer: D: T1587-Develop Capabilities**
