### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT15:
1. Evading policy settings that disable the command prompt by copying and patching `cmd.exe`.
2. Facilitating the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable**
  - This technique involves modifying the kernel callback table to execute arbitrary code. While this could be used for persistence, it is not directly related to the described actions of evading command prompt restrictions or installing a backdoor.

- **B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and configurations. This could be relevant if the attacker is trying to maintain access by ensuring that security defenses are not effective. However, the question specifically mentions evading policy settings, not impairing defenses.

- **C: T1556.005-Reversible Encryption**
  - This technique involves using reversible encryption to protect credentials or data. This is not directly related to the described actions of evading command prompt restrictions or installing a backdoor.

- **D: T1649-Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates**
  - This technique involves stealing or forging authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access. This is not directly related to the described actions of evading command prompt restrictions or installing a backdoor.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question describes a scenario where APT15 evades command prompt restrictions by copying and patching `cmd.exe` and then facilitates the persistent installation of the RoyalDNS backdoor.
- The most relevant technique in this context is **T1562-Impair Defenses**. While the question does not explicitly state that defenses are impaired, evading policy settings that disable the command prompt can be seen as a form of impairing defenses. This technique allows the attacker to maintain access and install the backdoor without being detected or blocked by security policies.

**Final Answer: B: T1562-Impair Defenses**
