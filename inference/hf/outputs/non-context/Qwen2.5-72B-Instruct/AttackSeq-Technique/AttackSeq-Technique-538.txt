### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a renamed `rundll32.exe` (now called `ActiveFlash.exe`) is used to perform malicious actions.
   - The focus is on ensuring the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The TTPs mentioned are related to ensuring the malware runs automatically at system boot or user logon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This technique involves modifying the behavior of legitimate programs or system processes to execute malicious code. While this can be used to ensure persistence, it is more about altering the flow of execution rather than specifically ensuring startup at boot or logon.
   - **B: T1546.002-Screensaver**
     - This technique involves using the screensaver functionality to execute malicious code. This is a specific method of persistence but is not the most common or general way to ensure startup at boot or logon.
   - **C: T1574-Hijack Execution Flow**
     - This is the same as option A and has the same evaluation.
   - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
     - This technique involves ensuring that the malware is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a broad category that includes various methods such as registry run keys, scheduled tasks, and startup folders, which are commonly used for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about ensuring the malware's automatic startup during system boot or user logon.
   - The most relevant and broad technique that covers this requirement is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.
   - While **T1574-Hijack Execution Flow** can be used for persistence, it is more specific to altering the flow of execution rather than ensuring startup at boot or logon.
   - **T1546.002-Screensaver** is a specific method but not the most common or general way to ensure startup at boot or logon.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
