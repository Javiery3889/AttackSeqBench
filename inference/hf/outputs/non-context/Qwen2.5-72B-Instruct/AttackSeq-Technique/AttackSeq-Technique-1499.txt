### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker using the RogueRobin tool. The key points are:
- Execution of a PowerShell script.
- Obfuscation of the script using the COMPRESS technique from the Invoke-Obfuscation tool.
- Employment of sandbox detection methods for Defense Evasion.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

#### A: T1555.002-Securityd Memory
- **Description**: This technique involves stealing credentials from the memory of the `securityd` process on macOS.
- **Relevance**: This technique is specific to macOS and does not align with the described sequence involving PowerShell and sandbox detection.

#### B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls
- **Description**: This technique involves modifying or subverting trust controls to allow the execution of malicious code.
- **Relevance**: While this technique could be relevant in a broader context, it does not specifically align with the described sequence of obfuscation and sandbox detection.

#### C: T1564.011-Ignore Process Interrupts
- **Description**: This technique involves ignoring process interrupts to prevent the operating system from terminating a process.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more about maintaining persistence and evading detection, but it does not directly align with the described sequence of obfuscation and sandbox detection.

#### D: T1132-Data Encoding
- **Description**: This technique involves encoding data to obfuscate it, making it harder to detect or analyze.
- **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the described sequence, as the attacker used the COMPRESS technique from the Invoke-Obfuscation tool to obfuscate the PowerShell script. Data encoding is a common method for obfuscation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: The attacker executed a PowerShell script.
2. **Obfuscation**: The script was obfuscated using the COMPRESS technique from the Invoke-Obfuscation tool.
3. **Sandbox Detection**: The attacker employed sandbox detection methods for Defense Evasion.

Given these steps, the most relevant technique is **T1132-Data Encoding** because it directly relates to the obfuscation of the PowerShell script.

**Final Answer: D: T1132-Data Encoding**
