### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands remotely for lateral movement.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering information on network configuration to support the operational objectives of FIN13.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves checking for active internet connections. While it can be useful, it is more specific to identifying internet connectivity rather than detailed network configuration.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1505-Server Software Component**
  - This technique involves the use of server software components to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not align with the goal of gathering network configuration information.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering detailed information about the network configuration, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and network interfaces. This aligns well with the goal of gathering network configuration information to support operational objectives.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of default accounts for authentication. While it can be useful for gaining access, it does not directly relate to gathering network configuration information.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attacker has already used WMI for lateral movement, which suggests they have gained access to the target system.
- The next logical step would be to gather detailed information about the network configuration to understand the environment better and support further operations.
- Among the given choices, **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery** is the most relevant and aligns with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
