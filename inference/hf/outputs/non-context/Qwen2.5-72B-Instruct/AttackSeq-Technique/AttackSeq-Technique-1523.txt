### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers gained initial access by modifying a Javascript file on a CDN server.
   - The attackers then used the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Modifying the Javascript file on the CDN server to load additional malicious code.
   - **Evasion:** Using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to obfuscate the malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1562.010-Downgrade Attack**
     - This technique involves forcing a system to use a less secure protocol or configuration. It does not align with the described sequence of modifying a Javascript file and obfuscating code.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
     - This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect traffic. It is not related to modifying a Javascript file or obfuscating code.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves compromising a website to deliver malicious content to visitors. This aligns with the initial access method of modifying a Javascript file on a CDN server to load additional malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information**
     - This technique involves obfuscating files or information to evade detection. This aligns with the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to obfuscate the malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access method described in the question is consistent with a drive-by compromise (T1189), where the attackers modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to load additional malicious code.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is the use of the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding to obfuscate the malicious code, which aligns with the technique of obfuscating files or information (T1027).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise
