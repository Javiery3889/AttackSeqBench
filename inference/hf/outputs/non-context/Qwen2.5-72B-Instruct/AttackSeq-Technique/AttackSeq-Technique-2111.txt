### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already gathered detailed information about the victim's computer using WMI queries and collected system details during the discovery phase.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is related to data acquisition from the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1070.003-Clear Command History**
     - This technique involves clearing the command history to cover the attacker's tracks. It is typically used for defense evasion, not for data acquisition.
   - **B: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
     - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information, which is more relevant to the initial stages of an attack or during the execution of malware. It is not directly related to data acquisition.
   - **C: T1560-Archive Collected Data**
     - This technique involves compressing or archiving collected data to prepare it for exfiltration. While it is related to data handling, it is more of a post-acquisition step.
   - **D: T1005-Data from Local System**
     - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which aligns directly with the described scenario of data acquisition after the discovery phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attackers have already gathered detailed information about the victim's computer and collected system details during the discovery phase.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to collect data from the local system, which is exactly what T1005-Data from Local System describes.
   - The other techniques (A, B, and C) do not align as closely with the immediate next step of data acquisition.

**Final Answer: D: T1005-Data from Local System**
