### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an adversary gains initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the execution of SparrowDoor on the compromised systems by the threat actor FamousSparrow.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Next Step:** Execution of SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details. While this is a common step after gaining initial access, it does not directly align with the execution of SparrowDoor.
   - **B: T1484-Domain or Tenant Policy Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying domain or tenant policies, which is typically used to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. It does not align with the immediate execution of SparrowDoor.
   - **C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application to execute arbitrary code. While this is related to initial access, it does not describe the execution of SparrowDoor on the compromised system.
   - **D: T1053.002-At**
     - This technique involves scheduling tasks using the `at` command, which is a method for executing commands or scripts at a specified time. This aligns well with the execution of SparrowDoor, as it can be used to schedule the execution of the malware on the compromised system.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:**
   - The adversary gains initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
2. **Execution of SparrowDoor:**
   - After gaining access, the next logical step is to execute the malware (SparrowDoor) on the compromised system.
3. **Technique for Execution:**
   - The most plausible technique for executing SparrowDoor is scheduling a task using the `at` command, which is described by T1053.002.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1053.002-At
