### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has already collected browser history, cached credentials, and FTP client settings during the reconnaissance phase. The next step in the attack sequence is to attempt lateral movement using stolen admin credentials or vulnerabilities like MS08-067. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this lateral movement.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1055.015-ListPlanting**
  - ListPlanting involves creating or modifying a list of files or directories to be processed by a system or application. This technique is not typically used for credential theft or reconnaissance and does not align with the described sequence.

- **B: T1557.001-LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay**
  - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay involves responding to network requests for name resolution and relaying the authentication attempts to gain access to other systems. This technique is often used to capture and relay credentials, which can be used for lateral movement. This aligns well with the described sequence.

- **C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores, such as web browsers, FTP clients, and other applications. This aligns with the collection of browser history, cached credentials, and FTP client settings mentioned in the question.

- **D: T1137-Office Application Startup**
  - Office Application Startup involves using Office applications to execute malicious code when the application starts. This technique is not typically used for credential theft or reconnaissance and does not align with the described sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker has already collected browser history, cached credentials, and FTP client settings during the reconnaissance phase.
2. The next step is to attempt lateral movement using stolen admin credentials or vulnerabilities like MS08-067.
3. The technique that most likely occurred before lateral movement is the collection of credentials from password stores, as this aligns with the described reconnaissance activities.

**Final Answer: C: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
