### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers:
1. Used legitimate commands and tools to evade detection.
2. Maintained backdoor connections.
3. Specifically used plink.exe for RDP access over SSH.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence.

#### A: T1564.006 - Run Virtual Instance
- **Description**: This technique involves running a virtual instance to hide the presence of malicious activities.
- **Relevance**: While this technique can be used to evade detection, it does not directly relate to maintaining backdoor connections or using specific tools like plink.exe for RDP over SSH.

#### B: T1202 - Indirect Command Execution
- **Description**: This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often through legitimate tools or scripts.
- **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the use of legitimate commands and tools to evade detection. However, it does not specifically address maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.

#### C: T1072 - Software Deployment Tools
- **Description**: This technique involves using software deployment tools to distribute and execute malicious code.
- **Relevance**: This technique is more about deploying and executing code, which is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.

#### D: T1137.006 - Add-ins
- **Description**: This technique involves using add-ins to extend the functionality of applications, often for malicious purposes.
- **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Evaluate T1564.006 - Run Virtual Instance**: This technique is about hiding activities in a virtual instance, which is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.
2. **Evaluate T1202 - Indirect Command Execution**: This technique involves using legitimate commands and tools to evade detection, which aligns well with the described scenario. However, it does not specifically address maintaining backdoor connections.
3. **Evaluate T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**: This technique is about deploying and executing code, which is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.
4. **Evaluate T1137.006 - Add-ins**: This technique is about extending application functionality, which is not directly related to maintaining backdoor connections or using plink.exe for RDP over SSH.

Given the context of using legitimate commands and tools to evade detection and maintain backdoor connections, the most plausible answer is **T1202 - Indirect Command Execution**.

### Final Answer: B: T1202 - Indirect Command Execution
