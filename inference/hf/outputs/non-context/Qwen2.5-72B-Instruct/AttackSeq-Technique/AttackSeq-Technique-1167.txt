### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of events:
1. Malware is implanted through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
2. Longhorn (an APT group) uses secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts that come with software, systems, or services. It is not related to secure erase protocols or avoiding detection.

- **B: T1598.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick individuals into providing sensitive information. It is not related to secure erase protocols or avoiding detection.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. It is not related to secure erase protocols or avoiding detection.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise to avoid detection. This aligns well with the description of using secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting to avoid detection.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Malware Implantation**: The initial step involves implanting malware through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
2. **Secure Erase Protocols**: After the malware is implanted, Longhorn uses secure erase protocols to avoid detection. This involves renaming and overwriting files to remove traces of the attack.
3. **Indicator Removal**: The technique that best fits the description of using secure erase protocols to avoid detection is T1070-Indicator Removal.

**Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
