### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: How did FamousSparrow most likely exfiltrate data after SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys?
- **Key Points**:
  - SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS.
  - Communications were encrypted/decrypted with different multi-byte XOR keys.
  - The question asks about the method of data exfiltration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the same channel used for command and control (C2) communications. Given that SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS, this is a plausible method for exfiltration.
  - **B: T1055-Process Injection**: This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process. While this can be used for various purposes, it is not directly related to data exfiltration.
  - **C: T1518.001-Security Software Discovery**: This technique involves discovering security software on the victim's system. This is a reconnaissance activity and not related to data exfiltration.
  - **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**: This is the same as choice A and is also a plausible method for exfiltration.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifies that SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.
  - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) is a common technique where data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C2 communications.
  - Process Injection (T1055) and Security Software Discovery (T1518.001) are not directly related to data exfiltration.
  - Both choices A and D are the same and describe the most plausible method for exfiltration in this context.

**Final Answer: A: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
