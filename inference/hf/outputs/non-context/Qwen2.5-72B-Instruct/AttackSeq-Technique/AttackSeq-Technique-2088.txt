### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the Carbanak group, a well-known cybercriminal organization that targets financial institutions.
- **Sequence of TTPs**:
  1. **Reconnaissance**: Collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
  2. **Unknown Technique**: The technique we need to identify.
  3. **Lateral Movement**: Downloading and executing new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: Compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain a foothold in the target network. It does not fit well between reconnaissance and lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice B: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: Using phishing emails to gain initial access to the target network.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is often used to gain initial access, but it is not typically a step between reconnaissance and lateral movement. It is more likely to be part of the initial access phase.

- **Answer Choice C: T1584.005-Botnet**
  - **Description**: Using a botnet to maintain persistence and perform various malicious activities.
  - **Relevance**: Botnets are used for maintaining persistence and can be part of the attack lifecycle, but they are not typically a step between reconnaissance and lateral movement.

- **Answer Choice D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
  - **Description**: Extracting credentials from the operating system to gain additional access.
  - **Relevance**: Credential dumping is a common technique used after reconnaissance to gather the necessary credentials to move laterally within the network. This fits well between the reconnaissance phase and the lateral movement phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance**: Carbanak collects data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
2. **Credential Dumping (T1003)**: Carbanak extracts credentials from the operating system to gain additional access.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Carbanak downloads and executes new payloads to move laterally in the infrastructure.

**Final Answer: D: T1003-OS Credential Dumping**
