### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in a Cobalt Strike attack:
1. A Listener was configured to enable communication with the C2 server.
2. Reflective DLL injection was used to load the beacon.dll.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripts to execute commands and scripts. While this could be part of the attack, it is not specifically tied to the communication setup or the loading of the beacon.dll.

- **B: T1053.007-Container Orchestration Job**
  - This technique involves using container orchestration tools to schedule and manage tasks. This is not typically relevant to the setup of a C2 communication or the loading of a DLL in a Cobalt Strike attack.

- **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. Configuring a Listener in Cobalt Strike to enable communication with the C2 server would likely involve setting up an application layer protocol.

- **D: T1056.001-Keylogging**
  - This technique involves capturing keystrokes to gather sensitive information. While keylogging could be part of the attack, it is not directly related to the setup of C2 communication or the loading of the beacon.dll.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Listener Configuration**: The first step is configuring a Listener in Cobalt Strike to enable communication with the C2 server. This involves setting up a communication channel.
2. **Application Layer Protocol**: To establish this communication, the attacker would likely use an application layer protocol (T1071) to facilitate the connection.
3. **Reflective DLL Injection**: After the communication channel is established, the attacker uses reflective DLL injection to load the beacon.dll, which is a key component of Cobalt Strike for maintaining persistence and executing further commands.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between configuring the Listener and using reflective DLL injection is the setup of an application layer protocol.

**Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
