### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of events in an attack:
1. ChromeLoader installed a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic.
2. Operation In(ter)ception's malware served as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two events.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1547.014-Active Setup**
  - **Description**: Active Setup is a persistence technique where an attacker can use the Active Setup registry key to execute arbitrary commands or scripts when a user logs in.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used for persistence, not for intercepting browser traffic or downloading additional stages of malware.

- **B: T1090.002-External Proxy**
  - **Description**: External Proxy involves using a proxy server to route network traffic through an external server, often to mask the origin of the traffic or to bypass network restrictions.
  - **Relevance**: This technique could be used to intercept and manipulate outgoing browser traffic, which aligns with the first event in the sequence.

- **C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise**
  - **Description**: Supply Chain Compromise involves compromising a third-party supplier to gain access to the target organization.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to intercepting browser traffic or downloading additional stages of malware.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - **Description**: Ingress Tool Transfer involves the transfer of tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is used to download additional stages of malware, which aligns with the second event in the sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **ChromeLoader installed a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic**:
   - This suggests that the attacker has already gained some level of control over the browser and is monitoring network traffic.

2. **Operation In(ter)ception's malware served as a downloader for a fourth stage from a C2**:
   - This indicates that the malware is downloading additional components from a command and control (C2) server.

3. **Evaluating the Techniques**:
   - **T1547.014-Active Setup** is not relevant to intercepting browser traffic or downloading additional stages.
   - **T1090.002-External Proxy** is relevant to intercepting browser traffic, but it does not directly lead to downloading additional stages.
   - **T1195-Supply Chain Compromise** is not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer** is directly relevant to downloading additional stages of malware, which fits the second event in the sequence.

Given the sequence of events, the most plausible technique that occurred between the installation of the listener and the downloading of the fourth stage is **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**.

### Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer
