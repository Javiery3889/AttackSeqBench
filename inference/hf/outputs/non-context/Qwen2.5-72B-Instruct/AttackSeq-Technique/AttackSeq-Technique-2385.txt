### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the LightNeuron malware:
1. **Discovery of system network configurations** using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.
2. **Exfiltration of locally collected data** using a backdoor function.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1556.008-Network Provider DLL**
  - This technique involves modifying the Network Provider DLL to manipulate network traffic. It is not directly related to data collection or exfiltration, but rather to network manipulation. This does not fit well between the discovery and exfiltration steps.

- **B: T1005-Data from Local System**
  - This technique involves collecting data from the local system, which is a logical step after discovering system network configurations and before exfiltrating the data. This fits well in the sequence.

- **C: T1123-Audio Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing audio from the system, which is a specific type of data collection. While it is a form of data collection, it is not a general step that would typically occur between network discovery and data exfiltration.

- **D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a command and control (C2) channel, which is the final step in the sequence described. It does not fit between the discovery and exfiltration steps.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Discovery of system network configurations** using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` is the initial step.
2. **Data collection** from the local system is a logical next step, as the attacker would need to gather the data before exfiltrating it.
3. **Exfiltration of locally collected data** using a backdoor function is the final step.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred between the discovery and exfiltration steps is **T1005-Data from Local System**.

**Final Answer: B: T1005-Data from Local System**
