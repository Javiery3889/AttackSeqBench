### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the RIG Exploit Kit, which distributes CEIDPageLock by exploiting a vulnerability and tampering with the victim's browser homepage.
   - After this, a dropper starts a kernel-mode driver for persistence.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** RIG Exploit Kit exploits a vulnerability to distribute CEIDPageLock.
   - **Homepage Tampering:** The exploit kit tampers with the victim's browser homepage.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** A dropper starts a kernel-mode driver for persistence.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This technique involves an adversary luring victims to a website that hosts an exploit. This is likely the initial step where the RIG Exploit Kit is used.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise**
     - This is the same as choice A and is also a plausible initial step.
   - **C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a remote system. This could be used for command and control (C2) communication but is not a likely step between the initial compromise and the persistence mechanism.
   - **D: T1219-Remote Access Software**
     - This technique involves the use of remote access tools (RATs) to maintain access to a system. This could be a step after the initial compromise but is not typically used for persistence in the way described (starting a kernel-mode driver).

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The initial compromise (T1189-Drive-by Compromise) is the first step.
   - After the initial compromise, the exploit kit tampers with the browser homepage.
   - The next logical step before starting the kernel-mode driver for persistence would be to establish a communication channel with the attacker's server, which is typically done using application layer protocols (T1071-Application Layer Protocol).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
