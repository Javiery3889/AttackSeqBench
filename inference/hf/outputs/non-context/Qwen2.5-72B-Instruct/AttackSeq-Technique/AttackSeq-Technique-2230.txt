### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an adversary has discovered machines in a compromised network using scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan.
- The next step in the attack sequence involves lateral movement, specifically by transferring tools and establishing network tunnels.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1008 - Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels when the primary ones are detected or blocked. This is not directly related to the transfer of tools or establishing network tunnels.
- **T1548 - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: This technique involves exploiting mechanisms that allow for privilege escalation. While this could be a part of the attack, it does not directly address the transfer of tools or establishing network tunnels.
- **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer**: This technique involves transferring tools or files from one system to another within a network to facilitate further actions, such as lateral movement. This aligns well with the described scenario of transferring tools and establishing network tunnels.
- **T1072 - Software Deployment Tools**: This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to deploy malware or other tools. While this could be used for lateral movement, it is more about using existing deployment mechanisms rather than directly transferring tools.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The scenario describes the use of scanning tools to discover machines and then transferring tools and establishing network tunnels for lateral movement.
- Among the given options, **T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the transfer of tools and files necessary for lateral movement.
- The other options, while potentially relevant in different contexts, do not specifically address the transfer of tools and establishing network tunnels.

**Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
