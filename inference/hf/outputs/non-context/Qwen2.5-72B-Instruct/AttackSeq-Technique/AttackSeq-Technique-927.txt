### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence where Volatile Cedar uses keylogging to gain credentials and then connects to a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Keylogging (Credential Access)**: T1056
  - **Connecting to a multi-tiered server backend framework**: This suggests communication with a command and control (C2) server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications to gain initial access. While it is a common initial access technique, it does not fit the context of the question, which is about post-credential access communication.
- **Answer Choice B: T1497.001-System Checks**
  - **Relevance**: This sub-technique involves checking the system for specific conditions before executing an attack. It is not directly related to communication with a C2 server.
- **Answer Choice C: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves altering data to make it harder to detect. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it does not specifically describe the communication with a C2 server.
- **Answer Choice D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - **Relevance**: This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. This fits the context of the question, as it describes the communication with a multi-tiered server backend framework.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Keylogging (T1056)**: Volatile Cedar uses keylogging to gain credentials.
2. **Communication with C2 Server**: After gaining credentials, the campaign needs to communicate with a multi-tiered server backend framework to control targeted systems.
3. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**: The most likely technique for this communication is using standard application layer protocols, which aligns with the need to control systems remotely.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
