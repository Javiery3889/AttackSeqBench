### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor "Before Dropping Elephant" gained initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique was most likely used to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before the initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1008-Fallback Channels**: This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary ones are detected or disrupted. This is not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.
- **T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks**: This technique involves scanning IP blocks to identify potential targets. While this can be part of the reconnaissance phase, it is more about identifying technical vulnerabilities rather than gathering specific information about high-profile entities.
- **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**: This technique involves collecting information about specific individuals, such as their roles, contact information, and other details that can be used to craft targeted spear-phishing attacks. This aligns well with the need to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
- **T1074-Data Staged**: This technique involves preparing data for exfiltration. This is a post-compromise activity and not relevant to the initial information gathering phase.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described involves gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails. To successfully execute such an attack, the threat actor would need detailed information about the targets, including their roles and contact information.
- Among the given options, **T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information** is the most relevant technique for gathering the necessary information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
- The other techniques (T1008, T1595.001, and T1074) do not align as closely with the initial information gathering phase required for a targeted spear-phishing attack.

**Final Answer: C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
