### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. A macro is enabled to execute a payload.
2. The payload is executed through `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32`.
3. The malware then initiates SSL communication with a command and control (C2) server using an expired digital certificate.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the SSL communication with the C2 server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C2 server. However, the question specifically mentions SSL communication, which is a transport layer protocol. This technique is more about the method of communication rather than a step that occurs before the communication.

- **B: T1542.003-Bootkit**
  - This technique involves modifying the boot process to maintain persistence. While this is a sophisticated method, it is not typically a step that occurs immediately before establishing C2 communication. It is more about ensuring the malware remains on the system after a reboot.

- **C: T1552.001-Credentials In Files**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from files on the system. While this could be a part of the malware's overall strategy, it is not a necessary step before establishing C2 communication. The question does not mention any credential theft.

- **D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves techniques to detect and avoid virtualized environments or sandboxes. Malware often performs these checks before establishing C2 communication to ensure it is not being analyzed in a controlled environment. This is a plausible step that could occur before the SSL communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes a sequence where a macro is enabled, a payload is executed, and then SSL communication is established with a C2 server.
2. The most likely step before the SSL communication would be to ensure the environment is not a virtualized or sandboxed environment, as malware often performs these checks to avoid detection.
3. Among the given choices, T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is the most plausible technique that would occur before the SSL communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
