### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker compromises websites using watering hole tactics and injects them with exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - The next step involves executing custom shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, initializing a network connection, and downloading a payload 'dropper.dll'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. While this could be part of the initial compromise, it does not align with the actions described after the website compromise.
   - **T1651-Cloud Administration Command:**
     - This technique involves using cloud administration commands to manage cloud resources. It is not relevant to the described sequence of actions, which involve executing shellcode and downloading a payload.
   - **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a client application (e.g., a web browser) to execute arbitrary code. This aligns well with the described actions of executing custom shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, and downloading a payload.
   - **T1207-Rogue Domain Controller:**
     - This technique involves setting up a rogue domain controller to capture credentials and other sensitive information. It is not relevant to the described sequence of actions.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial compromise of websites using watering hole tactics and injecting them with exploits (CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782) suggests that the attacker is targeting client applications.
   - The next steps involve executing custom shellcode, de-obfuscating strings, initializing a network connection, and downloading a payload. These actions are consistent with exploiting a client application to gain execution on the victim's system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK technique that aligns with these actions is **T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: T1203-Exploitation for Client Execution**
