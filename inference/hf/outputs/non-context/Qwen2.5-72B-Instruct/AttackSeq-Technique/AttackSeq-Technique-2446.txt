### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Elise malware.
   - Key points:
     - **Obfuscation techniques for data exfiltration** using base64-encoded cookie values.
     - **Anti-virtual-machine features**.
     - **Spoofing of queries to non-existing domains**.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1218.014-MMC**
     - This technique involves the misuse of Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute arbitrary code. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, which focuses on obfuscation, anti-VM features, and domain spoofing.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1070.004-File Deletion**
     - This technique involves deleting files to cover tracks or remove evidence. While it could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly follow the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice C: T1012-Query Registry**
     - This technique involves querying the Windows registry to gather information. It does not align with the described sequence of TTPs, which focuses on obfuscation, anti-VM features, and domain spoofing.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade virtualization and sandbox environments. This aligns well with the described anti-virtual-machine features of the Elise malware.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Elise malware uses obfuscation techniques for data exfiltration, which suggests it is trying to avoid detection.
   - The malware also has heavy anti-virtual-machine features, which is a common technique to evade analysis in sandbox environments.
   - The spoofing of queries to non-existing domains is another evasion technique to avoid detection by security systems.
   - Among the given choices, **T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion** is the most relevant and aligns with the described TTPs.

**Final Answer: D: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
