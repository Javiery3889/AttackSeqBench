### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where the Carbanak group has used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access. However, the question already states that the Carbanak group has used Cobalt Strike to map the internal network, which suggests they have already gained access and are in the reconnaissance phase. Therefore, this technique is less likely to occur next.

- **B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network. While this could be a potential next step, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after mapping the internal network.

- **C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or files to other systems within the network to facilitate lateral movement. After mapping the internal network, the next logical step would be to transfer tools to other systems to move laterally and gain access to additional resources.

- **D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
  - This technique involves determining the physical locations of systems or individuals within the network. While this could be useful for certain types of attacks, it is not the most immediate or logical next step after mapping the internal network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The Carbanak group has already used Cobalt Strike to map the internal network, which is a reconnaissance activity.
2. After mapping the network, the next logical step would be to transfer tools to other systems to facilitate lateral movement.
3. T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer aligns best with this next step in the attack sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1570-Lateral Tool Transfer**
