### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where BitterAPT initially distributed their malware through compromised websites.
   - The focus is on the communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial distribution: Compromised websites (e.g., gandharaart[.]org).
   - Communication with compromised systems: Multiple CnC servers (e.g., blitzchatlog.ddns.net, playupdateapp.serveblog.net).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1114.003 - Email Forwarding Rule:**
     - This technique involves setting up email forwarding rules to send copies of emails to an attacker-controlled email account. It is not directly related to CnC communication.
   - **B: T1568 - Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This technique involves using dynamic DNS (DDNS) or other methods to resolve domain names to IP addresses that can change over time. This is a common method for maintaining CnC communication, especially when using multiple CnC servers.
   - **C: T1568 - Dynamic Resolution:**
     - This is the same as answer choice B.
   - **D: T1566 - Phishing:**
     - This technique involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a trusted source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or deploying malware. While phishing can be used for initial access, it is not directly related to CnC communication.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most plausible technique for facilitating communication with compromised systems using multiple CnC servers is **T1568 - Dynamic Resolution**. This technique allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised systems by dynamically resolving domain names to different IP addresses, which can help evade detection and maintain persistent communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: T1568 - Dynamic Resolution
