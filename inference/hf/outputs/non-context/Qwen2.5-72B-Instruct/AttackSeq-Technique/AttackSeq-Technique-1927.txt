### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where `sysBus32.exe` downloads and executes a second stage from a C2 (Command and Control) server, and other executables like `libCache32.exe` perform their tasks. The communication with the C2 infrastructure is hosted on Novinhost. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique facilitated this communication.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1056-Input Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, to gather sensitive information. It does not directly relate to communication with a C2 server.

- **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves adversaries transferring tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. While this could be part of the initial stages of the attack, it does not specifically address the communication with the C2 server.

- **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves adversaries using multiple communication channels to maintain resilience and ensure they can continue to communicate with the C2 server even if one channel is disrupted. This could be relevant if the communication with Novinhost is part of a fallback mechanism.

- **D: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves adversaries using native APIs to interact with the operating system and perform actions. While this could be used to facilitate communication, it is more about the method of interaction rather than the communication itself.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically mentions communication with the C2 infrastructure hosted on Novinhost. The most relevant technique for maintaining communication with a C2 server, especially in a scenario where multiple executables are involved and the communication is ongoing, is **T1008-Fallback Channels**.
  - This technique ensures that the communication remains robust and can adapt to disruptions, which is crucial for maintaining control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
