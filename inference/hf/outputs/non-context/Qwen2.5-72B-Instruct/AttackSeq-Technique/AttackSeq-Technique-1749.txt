### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021:
1. Employing PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance.
2. Leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.
3. Lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1087.004-Cloud Account**
  - This technique involves gathering information about cloud accounts. The question does not mention any cloud-related activities, so this is not relevant.

- **B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as usernames, passwords, and other credentials. While the question mentions leveraging compromised domain credentials, this technique is more about the initial gathering of such information, not the use of it for lateral movement.

- **C: T1021-Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using various remote services to move laterally within a network. The question specifically mentions lateral movement between IIS servers, which aligns with the use of remote services.

- **D: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - This sub-technique involves using cloud services for lateral movement. The question does not mention any cloud services, so this is not relevant.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
   - PowerSploit and SharpHound are used for reconnaissance to gather information about the network and potential vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Credential Access:**
   - Compromised domain credentials are used to access shared folders over SMB, indicating that the attackers have already obtained valid credentials.

3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - The attackers move laterally between IIS servers on the victim's network. This is a clear indication of using remote services to achieve lateral movement.

Given the context and the specific mention of lateral movement between IIS servers, the most plausible technique is **T1021-Remote Services**.

### Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
