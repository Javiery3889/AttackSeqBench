### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the DNSpionage campaign:
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: Exfiltration of user and domain information.
2. **Interception of Traffic**: Through DNS communication for further instructions.
3. **Communication with C2 Server**: The technique that facilitated this communication is the focus of the question.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's network, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase. However, it does not directly facilitate communication with the C2 server.

- **B: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols**
  - This sub-technique involves using publish/subscribe protocols for communication. While it is a form of communication, it is not typically associated with DNS communication, which is the focus of the question.

- **C: T1608.002-Upload Tool**
  - This sub-technique involves uploading tools to the victim's system. This is not related to communication with the C2 server.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using application layer protocols for communication. DNS is an application layer protocol, and it is commonly used for C2 communication in many campaigns, including DNSpionage.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: The campaign exfiltrated user and domain information, which aligns with T1590-Gather Victim Network Information.
2. **Interception of Traffic**: The campaign used DNS communication to intercept traffic and receive further instructions.
3. **Communication with C2 Server**: The technique that facilitated this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as DNS is an application layer protocol and is commonly used for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
