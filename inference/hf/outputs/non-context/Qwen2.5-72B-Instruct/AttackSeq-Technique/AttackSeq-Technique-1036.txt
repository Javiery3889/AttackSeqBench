### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers. The next step in the sequence involves gathering credentials using tools like Mimikatz to facilitate lateral movement. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the credential gathering.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for communication to exfiltrate data or communicate with a command and control server. This does not fit well with the sequence of gathering credentials.

- **B: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious activities. While this could be used to deploy tools like Mimikatz, it is not a necessary step before gathering credentials.

- **C: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's host, such as system configuration, network topology, and user accounts. This information is often necessary to identify which credentials to target and how to gather them effectively.

- **D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information**
  - This technique involves collecting information about the victim's identity, such as usernames, email addresses, and other personal details. While this can be useful, it is more specific to identity information rather than the broader host information needed for credential gathering.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells on SharePoint servers.
2. **Preparation for Credential Gathering**: Before gathering credentials, the attackers would need to understand the environment and identify potential targets. This involves gathering information about the victim's host, such as system configuration and user accounts.
3. **Credential Gathering**: Using tools like Mimikatz, the attackers gather credentials to facilitate lateral movement.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that occurred before credential gathering is **T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**.

**Final Answer: C: T1592-Gather Victim Host Information**
