### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where the Inception attackers gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word. After gaining initial access, POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server to perform actions based on the status code of a GET request. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the initial access.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies**
  - This technique involves leveraging trust relationships between networks to gain access. While it can be used to gain initial access, it is not typically associated with exploiting a specific vulnerability like CVE-2017-11882.

- **B: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking compute resources, which is not relevant to gaining initial access through a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.

- **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is typically done after gaining access, not before.

- **D: T1598-Phishing for Information**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which can be a precursor to gaining initial access. However, in this case, the initial access was gained through a specific vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) rather than phishing.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access was gained through exploiting CVE-2017-11882, which is a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that can be triggered by opening a malicious document.
- Phishing (T1598) is a common method to deliver such malicious documents, but the question specifically states that the initial access was through the vulnerability itself, not through phishing.
- The other techniques (T1590.003, T1496.001, and T1070) do not align with the described sequence of events.

Given the context, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers exploited the vulnerability directly, without the need for phishing or other techniques to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: None of the provided answer choices directly align with the described sequence of events. However, if we must choose the closest one, it would be:**

**Final Answer: D: T1598-Phishing for Information** (as a potential precursor, though not explicitly stated in the question).
