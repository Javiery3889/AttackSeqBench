### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after the adversaries used reflective code loading to evade defenses during the attack. Reflective code loading is a technique where adversaries load a malicious payload directly into memory, bypassing the need to write the payload to disk. This is often used to evade detection by security software.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
  - This technique involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and command and control (C2) communications. While this could be a subsequent step in an attack, it is not directly related to the evasion technique of reflective code loading.

- **B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation**
  - This technique involves using DNS requests to exfiltrate data or communicate with a C2 server. While it is a method of communication, it is not directly related to the evasion technique of reflective code loading.

- **C: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
  - This technique involves modifying or bypassing conditional access policies to gain unauthorized access to resources. This is more related to privilege escalation and access control, not directly to evasion techniques like reflective code loading.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a system. This is typically an early stage in an attack and not a subsequent step after using reflective code loading to evade defenses.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Reflective code loading is used to evade detection by loading malicious code directly into memory.
- After evading detection, the next logical step would be to establish and maintain command and control (C2) communications to further the attack.
- Among the given choices, **T1104-Multi-Stage Channels** is the most plausible technique to occur after reflective code loading, as it involves setting up multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

**Final Answer: A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels**
