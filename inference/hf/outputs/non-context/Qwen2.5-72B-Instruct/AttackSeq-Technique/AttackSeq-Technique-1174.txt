### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where:
1. APT29 deployed public exploits (e.g., CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) to gain initial access to vulnerable systems.
2. APT29 then maintained persistent access by:
   - Obtaining legitimate credentials.
   - Using anonymizing services.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity**
  - This technique involves using a hybrid identity to gain access to a network. It is not directly related to obtaining legitimate credentials or using anonymizing services.

- **B: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encrypted channels to communicate with the compromised system. While it can be used to maintain persistence, it does not directly involve obtaining legitimate credentials or using anonymizing services.

- **C: T1659-Content Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting content into web pages or applications. It is not directly related to obtaining legitimate credentials or using anonymizing services.

- **D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. This aligns well with the described sequence where APT29 obtained legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT29 used public exploits (e.g., CVE-2019-19781 Citrix) to gain initial access to vulnerable systems.
2. **Maintaining Persistence**:
   - **Obtaining Legitimate Credentials**: APT29 obtained legitimate credentials to maintain access.
   - **Using Anonymizing Services**: APT29 used anonymizing services to hide their activities.

The technique that most likely occurred before APT29 maintained persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and using anonymizing services is **T1078-Valid Accounts**.

**Final Answer: D: T1078-Valid Accounts**
