### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the 'yty' framework used plugins like 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering. These activities fall under the Collection tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
  - This technique involves the automatic exfiltration of collected data. After collecting data (screenshots and system information), the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data to the attacker's server.

- **B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories**
  - This technique involves collecting data from information repositories such as databases, file shares, and other data stores. While this is a collection technique, it is not the next logical step after taking screenshots and gathering system information.

- **C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetrically encrypted non-C2 (Command and Control) protocol. This is a specific method of exfiltration, which is a logical next step after data collection.

- **D: T1542.003-Bootkit**
  - This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a system. This is not a logical next step after data collection and does not align with the described sequence.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The 'yty' framework used plugins to take screenshots and gather system information, which are activities under the Collection tactic.
2. After collecting data, the next logical step is to exfiltrate the data to the attacker's server.
3. Among the answer choices, T1020-Automated Exfiltration and T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol both involve exfiltration.
4. T1020-Automated Exfiltration is a more general term, while T1048.001 is a specific method of exfiltration.
5. Given the context, T1020-Automated Exfiltration is the most plausible and general answer.

**Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration**
