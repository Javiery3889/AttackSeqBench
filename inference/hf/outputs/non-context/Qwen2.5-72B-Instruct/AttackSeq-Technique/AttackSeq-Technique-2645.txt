### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has:
1. Staged collected data in a temporary folder.
2. Encrypted the data for protection.
3. Transmitted the files to the command and control (C&C) servers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the system. It is typically used in the reconnaissance phase to understand the network environment. This does not align with the transmission of encrypted data to C&C servers.

- **B: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data using a symmetrically encrypted protocol that is not part of the C2 channel. This could be a plausible choice if the data is being transmitted over a non-C2 protocol, but the question specifically mentions C&C servers, which suggests a C2 channel.

- **C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - This technique involves exfiltrating data over the established C2 channel. Given that the data is being transmitted to C&C servers, this is the most likely choice. The C2 channel is the primary method for communication between the attacker and the compromised system, making it the most appropriate technique for this scenario.

- **D: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - This technique involves scanning for vulnerabilities or open ports on the network. It is typically used in the reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets. This does not align with the transmission of encrypted data to C&C servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question describes the staging and encryption of data.
2. The next step is the transmission of this data to C&C servers.
3. Among the answer choices, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the most appropriate because it directly involves transmitting data over the established C2 channel, which is the method used to communicate with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
