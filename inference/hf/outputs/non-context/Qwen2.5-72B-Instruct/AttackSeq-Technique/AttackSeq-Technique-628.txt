### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where a VB Script is used to extract and execute a payload delivered via a malicious HTA (HTML Application) file during the initial access phase.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Initial Access: Malicious HTA file
  - Execution: VB Script to extract and execute the payload

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1011-Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium**
  - **Evaluation**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over a network medium other than the command and control channel. It is typically used in the later stages of an attack, after the attacker has gained access and performed other actions like data collection. It is not likely to occur immediately after the initial execution of the payload.
  
- **Answer Choice B: T1106-Native API**
  - **Evaluation**: This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While it can be used during the execution phase, it is more about the method of execution rather than a subsequent step in the attack sequence. It does not fit well as the next logical step after the initial execution of the payload.
  
- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Evaluation**: This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. Since the question already mentions that the initial access was achieved via a malicious HTA file, this technique would not be a subsequent step in the attack sequence.
  
- **Answer Choice D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
  - **Evaluation**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at a later time. It is a common technique used after the initial execution of a payload to ensure persistence and maintain access to the system. This fits well as a logical next step after the initial execution of the payload.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker gains access to the system via a malicious HTA file.
2. **Execution**: A VB Script is used to extract and execute the payload.
3. **Next Logical Step**: To maintain persistence and ensure the malware continues to run, the attacker might create a scheduled task to execute the payload at regular intervals or at specific times.

**Final Answer: D: T1053.005-Scheduled Task**
