### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Shuckworm used malicious documents to execute the Pterodo backdoor and scheduled tasks to maintain their foothold.
- **Key TTPs Mentioned**:
  - Malicious documents to execute the backdoor.
  - Scheduled tasks to support the foothold.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms that ensure a backdoor or malware is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the need to ensure the backdoor remains active across system reboots.
- **Answer Choice B: T1098 - Account Manipulation**
  - This technique involves altering account properties or permissions to maintain access. While it can be useful for persistence, it does not directly ensure that the backdoor is executed at boot or logon.
- **Answer Choice C: T1204.003 - Malicious Image**
  - This technique involves using images to deliver or execute malicious content. It is not relevant to ensuring persistence across reboots.
- **Answer Choice D: T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces or scripting to execute commands. While it can be used to set up persistence, it is not the primary technique for ensuring the backdoor remains active across reboots.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question specifically mentions the need to ensure the backdoor remains active across system reboots.
  - **T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution** is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves setting up mechanisms that trigger the execution of the backdoor at system boot or user logon.
  - The other techniques (T1098, T1204.003, and T1059) do not directly address the need for persistence across reboots.

**Final Answer: A: T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
