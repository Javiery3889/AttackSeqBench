### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where threat actors have acquired servers, either through compromise or legitimate purchase, and are using these servers to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control (C2) purposes. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely to occur after this initial step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566.001-Spearphishing Attachment**
  - This technique involves sending spearphishing emails with attachments to gain initial access to a target network. This is typically an early stage in an attack and does not align with the scenario of configuring malicious infrastructure for C2.

- **B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities**
  - This technique involves acquiring tools, exploits, or other capabilities to support the attack. While this could be relevant, it is more about the preparation phase rather than the configuration of C2 infrastructure.

- **C: T1133-External Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using external remote services (e.g., RDP, SSH) to access and control systems. This is a plausible next step after setting up C2 infrastructure, as the threat actors would need to manage and control their malicious servers.

- **D: T1098.007-Additional Local or Domain Groups**
  - This technique involves adding accounts to local or domain groups to gain elevated privileges. This is more about maintaining persistence and privilege escalation, which is not directly related to the configuration of C2 infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The threat actors have acquired servers and configured them for C2 purposes.
2. After setting up the C2 infrastructure, the next logical step would be to manage and control these servers.
3. **T1133-External Remote Services** is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves using remote access methods to interact with the malicious infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services**
