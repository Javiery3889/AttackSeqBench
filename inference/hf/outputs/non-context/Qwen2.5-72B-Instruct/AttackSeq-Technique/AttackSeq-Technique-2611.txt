### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a sequence of actions by the NanHaiShu malware. The sequence includes:
  1. Establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.
  2. Communicating with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.
- **Task**: Identify the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurs between these two actions for gathering specific system details from the infected machine.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries using various methods to hide their infrastructure to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about concealing the attacker's infrastructure rather than gathering system details from the infected machine. It is not a good fit for the described sequence.

- **Answer Choice B: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries discovering domain trust relationships to identify potential lateral movement paths.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique is useful for identifying network topology, it is not specifically about gathering system details from the infected machine. It is not the most relevant choice.

- **Answer Choice C: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries ensuring their malware runs at system startup or logon.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial persistence mechanism (modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry). It does not fit the requirement of gathering system details.

- **Answer Choice D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and other system details.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is directly relevant to the task of gathering specific system details from the infected machine. It fits well between the persistence establishment and the communication with C&C servers.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Persistence Establishment**: NanHaiShu modifies the '%regrun%' registry entry to ensure it runs at startup.
2. **System Information Discovery**: The malware gathers specific system details to understand the environment it is operating in.
3. **C&C Communication**: The malware then communicates with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers.

**Final Answer: D: T1082-System Information Discovery**
