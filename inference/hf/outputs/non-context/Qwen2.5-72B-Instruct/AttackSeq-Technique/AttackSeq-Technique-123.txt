### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 (Command and Control) servers to receive commands and exfiltrate information.
- The next step in the sequence involves the destruction of data on targeted systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1568.002-Domain Generation Algorithms**
  - This technique involves the use of algorithms to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communication. It is not related to data destruction.
- **Answer Choice B: T1485-Data Destruction**
  - This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data on a system, which aligns with the described action of destroying data on targeted systems.
- **Answer Choice C: T1499.004-Application or System Exploitation**
  - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in applications or systems to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to data destruction.
- **Answer Choice D: T1543-Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. It does not directly relate to data destruction.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the question involves a backdoor communicating with C2 servers and then destroying data on targeted systems.
- Among the given answer choices, only **T1485-Data Destruction** directly aligns with the action of destroying data.
- The other techniques (T1568.002, T1499.004, and T1543) do not fit the context of data destruction.

**Final Answer: B: T1485-Data Destruction**
