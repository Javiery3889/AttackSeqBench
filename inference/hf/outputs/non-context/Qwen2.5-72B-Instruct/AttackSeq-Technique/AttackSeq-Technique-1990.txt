### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker uses HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls and deploy ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts. The next step in the sequence is to ensure that the malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW (Mark of the Web).

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

- **A: T1596.003-Digital Certificates**
  - This technique involves using digital certificates to sign malicious code, which can help in bypassing security controls. However, it does not directly address the issue of avoiding MOTW tags.

- **B: T1584-Compromise Infrastructure**
  - This technique involves compromising third-party infrastructure to host malicious content. While this can be used to deliver payloads, it does not directly address the issue of avoiding MOTW tags.

- **C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, which can include modifying security settings or bypassing security mechanisms. This could be relevant to avoiding MOTW tags, as it involves manipulating the environment to prevent security controls from tagging the payloads.

- **D: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves using resource forks to hide data within files. While it can be used to obfuscate malicious content, it does not directly address the issue of avoiding MOTW tags.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **HTML Smuggling** is used to bypass security controls and deploy ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
2. The next step is to ensure that the malicious payloads are not tagged with MOTW.
3. **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls** is the most relevant technique because it involves manipulating the environment to prevent security controls from tagging the payloads with MOTW.

**Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
