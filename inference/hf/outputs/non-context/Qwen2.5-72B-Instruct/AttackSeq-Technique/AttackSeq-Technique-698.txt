### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already set up malware within the infrastructure software for defense evasion. The next step in the sequence is the exploration of financial systems using remote administration tools. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this exploration.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying remote systems and their network configurations. It is a common initial step in network reconnaissance to understand the environment before further actions.
  
- **B: T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering and accessing cloud storage objects. While it can be part of an attack, it is not typically a prerequisite for exploring financial systems using remote administration tools.
  
- **C: T1202-Indirect Command Execution**
  - This technique involves executing commands indirectly, often to evade detection. While it can be used in various stages of an attack, it is not specifically related to the exploration of financial systems.
  
- **D: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - This technique involves stealing financial data. It is a final stage of the attack, not a step that occurs before exploring financial systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Setup**: The attackers have set up malware for defense evasion.
2. **Next Step**: They need to explore the network to identify the financial systems.
3. **Technique Evaluation**:
   - **T1018-Remote System Discovery** is the most logical step before exploring financial systems. It helps the attackers understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **T1619-Cloud Storage Object Discovery** is not directly related to network exploration.
   - **T1202-Indirect Command Execution** is a technique for evading detection, not for network exploration.
   - **T1657-Financial Theft** is a final stage, not a preparatory step.

### Final Answer: A: T1018-Remote System Discovery
