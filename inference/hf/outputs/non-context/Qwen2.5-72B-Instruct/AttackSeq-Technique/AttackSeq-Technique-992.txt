### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where FIN7 gains initial access through a phishing email. The email contains a VBS script that drops and launches a JavaScript backdoor on the victim's machine.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - Phishing email
  - VBS script
  - JavaScript backdoor

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1542.002-Component Firmware**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying firmware to maintain persistence or to execute malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the initial access or the immediate actions following the phishing email. It is more about long-term persistence and does not fit the context of the question.

- **Answer Choice B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using protocols other than the commonly used ones (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
  - **Relevance**: While this technique could be used later in the attack to exfiltrate data, it is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access through a phishing email and dropping a backdoor.

- **Answer Choice C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant because the VBS script and JavaScript backdoor are both scripts that need to be executed. After the initial access, the attacker would likely use the command and scripting interpreter to run the backdoor and establish further control over the victim's machine.

- **Answer Choice D: T1204.001-Malicious Link**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into clicking on a malicious link, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is related to the initial phishing email, but the question is asking about what happens after the initial access is gained. The malicious link is part of the initial access, not the next step.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The initial access is gained through a phishing email containing a VBS script.
  - The VBS script drops and launches a JavaScript backdoor.
  - The next logical step is to use the command and scripting interpreter to execute the backdoor and establish further control over the victim's machine.
  - Therefore, the most plausible next step is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.

**Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
