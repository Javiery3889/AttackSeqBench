### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence where a JavaScript file creates an executable (`d3reEW.exe`) to gather IP address information using the command `cmd /c ipconfig`.
- The next step in the sequence involves enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C (Command and Control) server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with a C&C server. Given that the question mentions enabling HTTPS communication, this is a strong candidate.

- **Answer Choice B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**
  - This technique involves creating scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code at a later time. While this could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.

- **Answer Choice C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy**
  - This technique involves using an internal proxy to route traffic. While it could be used to obfuscate communication, it is not directly related to enabling HTTPS communication.

- **Answer Choice D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering internet connection details, which is similar to the `ipconfig` command mentioned in the question. However, it does not directly relate to enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence described in the question involves gathering IP address information and then enabling HTTPS communication with a C&C server.
- The most relevant technique for enabling HTTPS communication is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.
- The other techniques (T1053, T1090.001, T1016.001) do not directly align with the specific step of enabling HTTPS communication.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
