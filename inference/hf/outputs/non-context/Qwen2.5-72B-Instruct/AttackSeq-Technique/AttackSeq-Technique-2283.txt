### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Regin malware:
1. Regin gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic.
2. Regin captured credentials by analyzing network traffic.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique fits between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1560.002-Archive via Library**
  - This technique involves compressing data to evade detection. It is typically used for exfiltration or to reduce the size of data before transmission. This does not fit well between gathering information and capturing credentials.

- **B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
  - This technique involves capturing network traffic to gather information. This fits well with the sequence because monitoring network traffic (as described in the first step) can naturally lead to capturing credentials from the network traffic (as described in the second step).

- **C: T1003.001-LSASS Memory**
  - This technique involves extracting credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory. While this is a method for capturing credentials, it is more specific to local system memory and does not align with the described network traffic monitoring.

- **D: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery**
  - This technique involves discovering active network connections on a system. While this can be part of the initial reconnaissance phase, it does not fit well between the described steps of monitoring network traffic and capturing credentials.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Step**: Regin gathered information on processes, memory utilization, and monitored network traffic.
2. **Intermediate Step**: Regin likely used network sniffing to capture network traffic, which is a logical next step after monitoring network traffic.
3. **Final Step**: Regin captured credentials by analyzing the network traffic.

**Final Answer: B: T1040-Network Sniffing**
