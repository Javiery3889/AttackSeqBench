### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where an attacker has executed a modular design with components like loaders and stealth implants on infected systems. The focus is on the next step, which is to prevent detection and forensic analysis on the compromised systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1543 - Create or Modify System Process**
  - This technique involves creating or modifying system processes to maintain persistence or execute malicious code. While this can help in maintaining access, it does not directly address the prevention of detection and forensic analysis.

- **B: T1070 - Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering forensic artifacts to impede analysis and detection. This directly aligns with the goal of preventing detection and forensic analysis.

- **C: T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls**
  - This technique involves subverting trust controls, such as code signing or security software, to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. While this can help in evading security measures, it does not specifically focus on removing forensic indicators.

- **D: T1078 - Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate credentials to gain access to systems. While this can help in maintaining access and evading detection, it does not directly address the removal of forensic indicators.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The question focuses on preventing detection and forensic analysis.
2. **T1070 - Indicator Removal** directly addresses the removal of forensic artifacts, which is crucial for preventing detection and forensic analysis.
3. The other techniques (T1543, T1553, and T1078) do not specifically focus on removing forensic indicators.

**Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal**
