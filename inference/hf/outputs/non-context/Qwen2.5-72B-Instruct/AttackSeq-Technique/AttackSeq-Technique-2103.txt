### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques during the infection chain to evade defense mechanisms.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing**
  - This technique involves modifying the arguments passed to a process to hide its true purpose. While this can be used to evade detection, it is more about obfuscation rather than directly evading sandboxing or analysis.

- **B: T1113-Screen Capture**
  - This technique involves capturing the contents of the screen, which is typically used for exfiltrating data or monitoring the victim's activities. It is not directly related to evading sandboxing or analysis.

- **C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
  - This technique involves detecting and evading virtualized environments and sandboxes. This is directly related to the question, as it is a common step in the infection chain to ensure that the malware is not being analyzed in a controlled environment.

- **D: T1571-Non-Standard Port**
  - This technique involves using non-standard ports for communication. While it can help evade some network-based detection, it is not directly related to evading sandboxing or analysis.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Process Argument Spoofing (T1564.010)**: This technique is more about obfuscation and not directly about evading sandboxing or analysis.
2. **Screen Capture (T1113)**: This technique is about data exfiltration and monitoring, not about evading sandboxing or analysis.
3. **Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1497)**: This technique is directly related to evading sandboxing and analysis, making it the most plausible choice.
4. **Non-Standard Port (T1571)**: This technique is about evading network detection, not directly about evading sandboxing or analysis.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible sequence is that the attackers first employed **Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (T1497)** to ensure that the environment is not a sandbox before proceeding with other anti-analysis techniques.

**Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**
