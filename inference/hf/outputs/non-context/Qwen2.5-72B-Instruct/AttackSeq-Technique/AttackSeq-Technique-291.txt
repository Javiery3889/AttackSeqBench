### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials.
   - After stealing the credentials, pings to the C2 (Command and Control) server are transmitted at regular intervals.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the pings to the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Backdoor Deployment:** The attacker has already deployed a backdoor.
   - **Credential Theft:** The backdoor is used to steal Google Chrome credentials.
   - **C2 Communication:** Pings to the C2 server are transmitted at regular intervals.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: T1069-Permission Groups Discovery:**
     - This technique involves discovering permission groups on a system, which is typically used to understand the environment and identify potential targets. It is not directly related to the sequence of stealing credentials and communicating with a C2 server.
   - **B: T1189-Drive-by Compromise:**
     - This technique involves compromising a victim's system through a malicious website. While it could be a method to initially deploy the backdoor, it does not fit the sequence of events after the backdoor is already in place and credentials are stolen.
   - **C: T1530-Data from Cloud Storage:**
     - This technique involves exfiltrating data from cloud storage services. It is not directly related to the sequence of stealing browser credentials and communicating with a C2 server.
   - **D: T1119-Automated Collection:**
     - This technique involves using automated methods to collect data from the victim's system. After deploying the backdoor and stealing credentials, the attacker would likely use automated collection to gather more data and prepare for regular communication with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is already in place and has stolen Google Chrome credentials.
   - Before pinging the C2 server, the attacker would need to collect the stolen credentials and prepare them for exfiltration.
   - Automated collection (T1119) is a logical step in this sequence, as it involves gathering the stolen credentials and other data to be sent to the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: T1119-Automated Collection
