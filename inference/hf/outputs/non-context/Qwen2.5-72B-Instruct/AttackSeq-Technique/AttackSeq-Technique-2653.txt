### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Dridex, a known malware.
   - Dridex employs heavy obfuscation and anti-debug techniques to evade detection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to communicate data such as the computer name and botnet ID number with its true Command and Control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. Encrypted POST requests are a common method for this communication.
     - This aligns well with the described scenario of Dridex communicating data via encrypted POST requests.

   - **Answer Choice B: T1622-Debugger Evasion**
     - This technique involves techniques to detect and evade debuggers, which is mentioned in the question but is not the focus of the communication with the C2 server.
     - This does not align with the communication aspect of the question.

   - **Answer Choice C: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate command and control traffic.
     - While this could be used in conjunction with encrypted POST requests, it is not the primary method of communication described in the question.

   - **Answer Choice D: T1591.001-Determine Physical Locations**
     - This technique involves determining the physical location of the victim.
     - This is not related to the communication of data with the C2 server via encrypted POST requests.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question focuses on the communication method used by Dridex to send data to its C2 servers.
   - The most relevant technique for this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves using standard application layer protocols, such as HTTP/HTTPS, to communicate with the C2 server.
   - Encrypted POST requests are a common method used in this technique to securely transmit data.

**Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
