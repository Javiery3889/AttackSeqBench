### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After Shamoon malware overwrites the disk’s boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy, which ATT&CK technique most likely executes next to achieve the destruction of target data on disks?
- **Key Points**:
  - Shamoon malware overwrites the disk’s boot records.
  - The next step is to achieve the destruction of target data on disks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**: This technique involves degrading or disabling security tools and services. While this could be part of the initial stages of an attack, it is not the next logical step after overwriting boot records.
  - **B: T1485-Data Destruction**: This technique involves the deletion or corruption of data to render it unusable. This aligns well with the goal of destroying target data on disks.
  - **C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking**: This technique involves taking control of network bandwidth, which is not relevant to the destruction of data on disks.
  - **D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification**: This technique involves changing domain policies to maintain persistence or evade detection. This is not directly related to the destruction of data on disks.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Action**: Shamoon malware overwrites the disk’s boot records to evade defenses.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After evading defenses, the malware would likely aim to achieve its primary goal, which is to destroy the target data on the disks.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: T1562-Impair Defenses**: Not the next logical step after overwriting boot records.
   - **B: T1485-Data Destruction**: Directly aligns with the goal of destroying target data on disks.
   - **C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking**: Not relevant to data destruction.
   - **D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification**: Not directly related to data destruction.

**Final Answer: B: T1485-Data Destruction**
