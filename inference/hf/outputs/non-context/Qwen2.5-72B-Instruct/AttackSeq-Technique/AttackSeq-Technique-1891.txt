### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group FIN13. The sequence is as follows:
1. Gather information on network and host configurations.
2. Target user accounts within victim networks.
3. Employ WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to target user accounts within victim networks.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1482-Domain Trust Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying trust relationships between domains. While it can provide valuable information about the network structure, it is not directly related to targeting user accounts.

- **B: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules**
  - This technique involves modifying Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to gain unauthorized access. It is more about modifying authentication mechanisms rather than discovering user accounts.

- **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While it can provide access to sensitive information, it is not specifically focused on discovering user accounts.

- **D: T1087-Account Discovery**
  - This technique involves identifying valid accounts and their associated privileges. It is directly related to targeting user accounts within victim networks.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Gather Information on Network and Host Configurations**: This is the initial step where the attacker collects information about the network and host configurations.
2. **Target User Accounts**: The next step is to identify and target user accounts. The most relevant technique for this step is T1087-Account Discovery, as it involves identifying valid accounts and their associated privileges.
3. **Employ WMI and Custom Web Shells for Lateral Movement**: After identifying the user accounts, the attacker uses WMI and custom web shells to move laterally within the network.

**Final Answer: D: T1087-Account Discovery**
