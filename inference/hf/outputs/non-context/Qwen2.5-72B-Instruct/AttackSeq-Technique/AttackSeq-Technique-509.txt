### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the SombRAT backdoor, part of the CostaRicto Campaign, has archived collected data in a custom storage file format.
- **Key TTP**: The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to have been used to transfer the data from the victim's system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1052.001 - Exfiltration over USB**
  - **Description**: This technique involves transferring data from a victim's system to a removable medium, such as a USB drive.
  - **Evaluation**: While this is a valid exfiltration technique, it is less likely in the context of a sophisticated backdoor like SombRAT, which typically uses network-based methods for data exfiltration.

- **Answer Choice B: T1129 - Shared Modules**
  - **Description**: This technique involves sharing and loading modules or libraries across multiple systems or processes.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is more about maintaining persistence and not about exfiltrating data. It does not fit the context of transferring collected data from the victim's system.

- **Answer Choice C: T1590.001 - Domain Properties**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using domain properties to store or exfiltrate data.
  - **Evaluation**: This technique is not commonly used for exfiltration and is more related to data storage within a domain environment. It does not fit the context of transferring data from the victim's system.

- **Answer Choice D: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data over the command and control (C2) channel that the malware uses to communicate with the attacker.
  - **Evaluation**: This is the most plausible technique for a backdoor like SombRAT. Backdoors typically use their C2 channels to exfiltrate data, making this the most logical choice.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Context Analysis**: The SombRAT backdoor has archived data in a custom storage file format.
2. **Exfiltration Method**: The most common and efficient method for a backdoor to exfiltrate data is over its C2 channel.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A**: Less likely due to the sophistication of SombRAT.
   - **B**: Not related to exfiltration.
   - **C**: Not a common exfiltration method.
   - **D**: Most logical and common method for backdoors.

**Final Answer: D: T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
