### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an iOS malware app that is installed with a hidden icon and runs in the background to collect sensitive information.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - The app is installed.
  - The app has a hidden icon.
  - The app runs in the background.
  - The app collects information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - **Description**: This technique involves encoding data to make it less recognizable to defenders.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used to obfuscate data during exfiltration or communication, not during the initial installation or execution of the app.
  - **Evaluation**: Not the most likely technique to occur before the app begins collecting information.

- **Answer Choice B: T1055.005-Thread Local Storage**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using thread-local storage to inject code into other processes.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to process injection and code execution within the context of a running process, not the initial installation or execution of the app.
  - **Evaluation**: Not the most likely technique to occur before the app begins collecting information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1204-User Execution**
  - **Description**: This technique involves tricking users into executing malicious code, often through social engineering.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the initial installation of the app, as it likely involves the user being tricked into installing the app.
  - **Evaluation**: This is a strong candidate for the technique that occurred before the app began collecting information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is specific to Linux systems and is not applicable to iOS.
  - **Evaluation**: Not relevant to the context of an iOS app.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The app must be installed on the device first.
  - The installation likely involves the user being tricked into installing the app, which aligns with the T1204-User Execution technique.
  - Once installed, the app can run in the background and collect sensitive information.
- **Conclusion**:
  - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the user was tricked into installing the app (T1204-User Execution) before the app began collecting information.

**Final Answer: C: T1204-User Execution**
