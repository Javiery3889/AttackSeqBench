### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor "Blind Eagle":
1. Used a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
2. Ensured execution upon system startup using the Login1.vbs script.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves the use of command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. This is relevant to the use of PowerShell commands, but it is already part of the initial step (using a JavaScript downloader to execute PowerShell commands).

- **B: T1134.005-SID-History Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting a user's Security Identifier (SID) history to gain access to resources. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as it does not involve command execution or persistence.

- **C: T1053.006-Systemd Timers**
  - This technique involves using systemd timers to schedule tasks on Linux systems. This is not relevant to the sequence described, as it is specific to Linux and the question mentions a Windows environment (ActiveXObject, PowerShell, and VBScript).

- **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves ensuring that a program or script is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This is relevant to the final step of ensuring execution upon system startup using the Login1.vbs script.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Step**: Blind Eagle used a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - This step involves T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1064 (Scripting).

2. **Intermediate Step**: We need to identify what likely occurred between the initial command execution and the final persistence mechanism.
   - The most plausible intermediate step would be to set up a mechanism to ensure the script runs automatically upon system startup.

3. **Final Step**: Blind Eagle ensured execution upon system startup using the Login1.vbs script.
   - This step involves T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

Given the sequence described, the most plausible intermediate step is setting up a mechanism to ensure the script runs automatically upon system startup, which aligns with T1547.

### Final Answer: D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
