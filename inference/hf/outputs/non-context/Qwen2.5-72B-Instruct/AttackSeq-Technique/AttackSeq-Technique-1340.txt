### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses anti-analysis techniques such as a custom packer and a virtual machine to execute code. The next step in the sequence involves downloading second stage shellcode from a specified URL for further control.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1572-Protocol Tunneling**
  - Protocol Tunneling involves encapsulating one protocol within another to bypass network security controls. This technique is often used to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data, but it is not typically used to download second stage shellcode.

- **B: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - Hide Artifacts involves concealing the presence of malicious files, processes, or other artifacts to avoid detection. While this technique is useful for maintaining stealth, it does not directly relate to the act of downloading second stage shellcode.

- **C: T1659-Content Injection**
  - Content Injection involves inserting malicious content into legitimate files or network traffic. This technique is often used to manipulate data or execute code, but it is not typically used to download second stage shellcode.

- **D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - Ingress Tool Transfer involves the transfer of tools or other files from an external system to the victim's system. This technique is directly related to the act of downloading second stage shellcode from a specified URL.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker uses anti-analysis techniques (custom packer and virtual machine) to execute code.
2. The next step involves downloading second stage shellcode from a specified URL.
3. Among the given choices, T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer is the most relevant technique because it specifically involves transferring tools or files from an external system to the victim's system, which aligns with the act of downloading second stage shellcode.

**Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
