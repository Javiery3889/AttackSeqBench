### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where APT28 has harvested credentials via spear-phishing and used OLDBAIT. The next step in their attack sequence involves moving deeper into the victim's network after exploiting internet-facing servers.
- **TTPs Mentioned**:
  - **Spear-Phishing**: A technique used to trick specific individuals into providing sensitive information, such as credentials.
  - **OLDBAIT**: A technique that involves using previously disclosed vulnerabilities or exploits to gain initial access.
  - **Exploitation of Internet-Facing Servers**: Gaining access to the network by exploiting vulnerabilities in servers that are exposed to the internet.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to systems or networks.
  - **Relevance**: After gaining initial access via spear-phishing and OLDBAIT, APT28 would likely use this technique to move laterally within the network by exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services.

- **Answer Choice B: T1021.007-Cloud Services**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using cloud services to move laterally within a network.
  - **Relevance**: While cloud services can be used for lateral movement, the question specifically mentions exploiting internet-facing servers, which suggests a more traditional network environment rather than a cloud-based one.

- **Answer Choice C: T1653-Power Settings**
  - **Description**: This technique involves modifying power settings to maintain persistence or to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more about maintaining access and avoiding detection rather than moving deeper into the network.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - **Description**: This technique involves hiding artifacts to avoid detection.
  - **Relevance**: While hiding artifacts is important for maintaining stealth, it does not directly help in moving deeper into the network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: APT28 gains initial access via spear-phishing and OLDBAIT.
2. **Exploitation of Internet-Facing Servers**: They exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers to gain a foothold in the network.
3. **Lateral Movement**: To move deeper into the network, they would need to exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to additional systems.

**Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
