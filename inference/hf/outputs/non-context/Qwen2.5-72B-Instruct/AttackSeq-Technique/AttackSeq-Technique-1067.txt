### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers used watering hole tactics to gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in Chrome and Internet Explorer.
   - After gaining initial access, they leveraged a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458) using a PowerShell loader.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Watering hole tactics exploiting vulnerabilities in Chrome and Internet Explorer.
   - Privilege Escalation: CVE-2019-1458 using a PowerShell loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1113-Screen Capture**
     - This technique involves capturing the contents of a user's screen. It is typically used for exfiltrating visual data and is not a common step before privilege escalation.
   - **B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
     - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. PowerShell is a command and scripting interpreter, and it is often used to execute malicious code and scripts, which can be a precursor to privilege escalation.
   - **C: T1204.003-Malicious Image**
     - This technique involves using a malicious image to trick users into executing malicious code. It is more related to initial access and not typically a step before privilege escalation.
   - **D: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
     - This technique involves using non-standard encoding to obfuscate data. While it can be used to hide malicious code, it is not a common step before privilege escalation.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after gaining initial access, the attackers would use a command and scripting interpreter (PowerShell) to execute the necessary commands to leverage the privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2019-1458).
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used to execute scripts and commands, making it a likely choice for the attackers to use before performing privilege escalation.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
