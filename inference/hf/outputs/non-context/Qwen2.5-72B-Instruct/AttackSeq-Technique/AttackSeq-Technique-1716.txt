### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the initial access technique used by Mustang Panda to deploy malicious payloads using embedded '.lnk' files. The key points to focus on are:
- Initial access
- Embedded '.lnk' files

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - Phishing involves tricking users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments. This technique is often used to gain initial access by sending emails with embedded links or attachments.
  - Embedded '.lnk' files can be part of a phishing campaign, where the user is tricked into opening the file, which then executes the malicious payload.

- **B: T1036-Masquerading**
  - Masquerading involves renaming or modifying the appearance of files or programs to make them appear legitimate. This technique is used to avoid detection but is not typically the initial access method.
  - While '.lnk' files can be masqueraded, this technique is more about post-compromise activities rather than initial access.

- **C: T1578.005-Modify Cloud Compute Configurations**
  - This technique involves altering cloud compute configurations to maintain persistence or gain access. It is not related to initial access using embedded files.

- **D: T1078.001-Default Accounts**
  - This technique involves using default accounts to gain access to systems. It is not related to the use of embedded '.lnk' files for initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The question specifically mentions the use of embedded '.lnk' files for initial access.
  - Phishing (T1566) is a common method for delivering such files, where the user is tricked into opening the file, leading to the execution of the malicious payload.
  - The other techniques (B, C, and D) do not align with the initial access method described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: T1566-Phishing**
