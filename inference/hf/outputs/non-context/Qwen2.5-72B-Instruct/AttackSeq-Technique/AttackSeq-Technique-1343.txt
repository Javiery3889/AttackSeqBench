### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence involving ShadowPad, where the attackers use DLL hijacking to execute a backdoor in a legitimate OLE-COM object viewing application. The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before this step to gain initial access to the victim's network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using encryption to protect command and control (C2) communications. While it is a common technique used by attackers to avoid detection, it is not typically used to gain initial access to a network. It is more relevant to the C2 phase of an attack.

- **B: T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**
  - This technique involves using voice communication (e.g., phone calls) to trick victims into providing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their systems. While it can be used to gain initial access, it is less common and less effective compared to other methods for sophisticated attacks like ShadowPad.

- **C: T1187-Forced Authentication**
  - This technique involves forcing a user to authenticate to a service or system, often by intercepting or redirecting authentication requests. It is more commonly used in scenarios where the attacker needs to gain access to a specific service or system, but it is not typically used as an initial access vector for network compromise.

- **D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to a network. This is a common and effective method for sophisticated attackers to gain a foothold in a victim's network. Public-facing applications are often exposed to the internet and can be vulnerable to various types of attacks, making them a prime target for initial access.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The question asks about the technique used to gain initial access to the victim's network.
2. **Evaluation of Techniques**:
   - **T1573-Encrypted Channel**: Not used for initial access.
   - **T1566.004-Spearphishing Voice**: Less common and less effective for sophisticated attacks.
   - **T1187-Forced Authentication**: More specific to service access, not initial network compromise.
   - **T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**: Common and effective for gaining initial access to a network.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for gaining initial access in this scenario is exploiting a public-facing application.

**Final Answer: D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
