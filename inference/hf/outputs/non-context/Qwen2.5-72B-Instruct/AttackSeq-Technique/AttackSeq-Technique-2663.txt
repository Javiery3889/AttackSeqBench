### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware Korplug:
1. Collects data from local and networked drives.
2. Gathers system information like system locale and IP addresses.
3. Facilitates encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers for further interaction.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves the use of bidirectional communication channels to maintain a persistent connection with the C&C server. While it is relevant to communication, it does not specifically mention encryption or fallback servers.

- **B: T1027.003-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other files or protocols. While it can be used for covert communication, it does not directly address encrypted communication or fallback C&C servers.

- **C: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive**
  - This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. While it is relevant to the initial data collection phase, it does not address the communication with C&C servers.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) to communicate with C&C servers. It can include encrypted communication (e.g., HTTPS) and is often used to establish a secure and reliable connection with fallback mechanisms.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: Korplug collects data from local and networked drives and gathers system information. This aligns with the initial stages of the attack.
2. **Communication**: The next step is to facilitate encrypted communication with fallback C&C servers. This is crucial for maintaining a secure and persistent connection.
3. **Relevance of T1071**: T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most relevant technique because it specifically addresses the use of standard protocols (which can be encrypted) to communicate with C&C servers. It also supports the concept of fallback mechanisms, which is important for maintaining command and control.

**Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
