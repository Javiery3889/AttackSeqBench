### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The attack sequence involves the download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros. After this, the RMS executable needs to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.
- **Key TTPs**: 
  - Download of malicious payloads via macros.
  - Maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of various methods to hide the infrastructure used in an attack, such as using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) or fast flux networks.
  - **Relevance**: While hiding infrastructure is important, it is not the primary technique used to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

- **Answer Choice B: T1059.007-JavaScript**
  - **Description**: This sub-technique involves the use of JavaScript to execute code on a victim's system.
  - **Relevance**: JavaScript can be used to download and execute payloads, but it is not specifically used to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

- **Answer Choice C: T1219-Remote Access Software**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of remote access software to maintain a persistent connection to the victim's system.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant because remote access software is specifically designed to maintain a persistent connection, which is necessary for the RMS executable to communicate with the threat actor's infrastructure.

- **Answer Choice D: T1566-Phishing**
  - **Description**: This technique involves the use of phishing to trick victims into providing sensitive information or executing malicious code.
  - **Relevance**: Phishing is used to gain initial access to a system, but it is not used to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with the download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros.
2. **Maintaining Contact**: After the initial access, the RMS executable needs to maintain a persistent connection to the threat actor's infrastructure.
3. **Relevant Technique**: The most relevant technique for maintaining a persistent connection is T1219-Remote Access Software.

**Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software**
