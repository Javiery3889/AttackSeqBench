### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses a signed credential-dumping tool during the Credential Access phase. After obtaining credentials, the attacker scans the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold. We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the scanning activity.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves using legitimate user or service accounts to gain access to systems. It is often used to maintain persistence and to move laterally within a network. This is a plausible technique to use before scanning the network, as the attacker would need valid credentials to perform network scanning without raising immediate suspicion.

- **B: T1037.003-Network Logon Script**
  - This technique involves modifying or creating logon scripts that run when a user logs on to a network. While this can be used for persistence, it is not typically a technique used immediately before network scanning. It is more about setting up long-term access.

- **C: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using protocols that are not typically used for application communication, such as ICMP or raw sockets, to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. This is not directly related to the sequence of obtaining credentials and scanning the network.

- **D: T1070-Indicator Removal**
  - This technique involves removing or altering system artifacts to avoid detection. While it is a common post-exploitation technique, it is not typically used before network scanning. It is more about covering tracks after actions have been taken.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attacker uses a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain credentials (Credential Access).
2. To scan the network for open ports, the attacker would need valid credentials to avoid detection and to have the necessary permissions.
3. Among the given choices, **T1078-Valid Accounts** is the most logical technique to have occurred before the network scanning, as it provides the necessary credentials for the attacker to perform the scan without raising suspicion.

**Final Answer: A: T1078-Valid Accounts**
