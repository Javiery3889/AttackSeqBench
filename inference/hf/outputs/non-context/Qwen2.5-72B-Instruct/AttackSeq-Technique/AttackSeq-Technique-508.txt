### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the SombRAT backdoor utilized protocol tunneling over DNS/HTTP for communication with C2 servers. The tools mentioned are pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY for proxying.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1090-Proxy**
  - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic through an intermediary server. While this is related to the use of proxies, it is more about the actual use of the proxy rather than the preparation or setup of the proxy.

- **B: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**
  - This technique involves transferring tools or other files from an external system into the compromised environment. This could be relevant if the tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were transferred to the compromised system before being used.

- **C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves gathering information about the network configuration of the compromised system. This is often a preliminary step to understand the network environment before setting up communication channels.

- **D: T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**
  - This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or information. This is typically used to reveal the actual content of files or commands, which is not directly related to setting up communication channels.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - The SombRAT backdoor is using protocol tunneling over DNS/HTTP for communication with C2 servers.
   - Tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY are being used for proxying.

2. **Preparation Steps**:
   - Before setting up the tunneling and proxying, the attacker would need to understand the network configuration of the compromised system to ensure the tools and techniques will work effectively.
   - The attacker would also need to transfer the necessary tools to the compromised system.

3. **Evaluating the Choices**:
   - **T1090-Proxy**: This is about using the proxy, not setting it up.
   - **T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer**: This is a necessary step to get the tools onto the compromised system.
   - **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**: This is a crucial step to understand the network environment before setting up the communication.
   - **T1140-Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information**: This is not directly related to setting up communication channels.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first discovers the system network configuration (T1016) to understand the network environment, and then transfers the necessary tools (T1105) to the compromised system.

**Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
