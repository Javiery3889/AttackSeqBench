### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a scenario where attackers have collected sensitive information from victims' devices, including contact lists, geo-locations, and voice recordings. The next step in the attack sequence involves transmitting this stolen data back to the attackers' infrastructure using HTTP POST requests.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described attack sequence:

- **A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication**
  - This technique involves the use of a command and control (C2) channel that allows for bidirectional communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't specifically address the transmission of stolen data via HTTP POST requests.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the use of common application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server. HTTP is a common application layer protocol, and HTTP POST requests are a method of transmitting data. This aligns well with the described scenario of using HTTP POST requests to transmit stolen data.

- **C: T1078-Valid Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of legitimate user accounts to gain access to systems. While this could be used in the initial stages of the attack, it does not describe the transmission of stolen data.

- **D: T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS**
  - This technique involves the use of fast flux DNS to obfuscate the location of C2 servers. While this could be used to make it harder to track the C2 infrastructure, it does not specifically address the transmission of stolen data via HTTP POST requests.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The question specifically mentions the use of HTTP POST requests to transmit stolen data.
- HTTP is an application layer protocol, and the technique that best describes the use of such protocols is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
- The other techniques (T1102.002, T1078, and T1568.001) do not directly address the transmission of data via HTTP POST requests.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
