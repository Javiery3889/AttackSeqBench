### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where phishing emails, chat messages, and Facebook posts are used to deliver Windows Shortcut files. These files lead to hex-encoded malicious binaries, which are then used to install persistent malware.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts**
  - This technique involves the use of valid accounts in cloud services to gain access or maintain persistence. While this could be a part of a broader attack, it does not directly follow the delivery of Windows Shortcut files and the installation of persistent malware.

- **B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to execute malicious code when the system boots or a user logs on. This is a common method for achieving persistence, which aligns well with the installation of persistent malware described in the question.

- **C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves the use of phishing to deliver malicious content. While phishing is mentioned in the question, it is the initial step in the attack sequence, not what occurs after the delivery of the Windows Shortcut files and the installation of persistent malware.

- **D: T1556.009-Conditional Access Policies**
  - This technique involves modifying conditional access policies to gain or maintain access. This is more related to network and account management and does not directly follow the delivery of Windows Shortcut files and the installation of persistent malware.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attack sequence starts with phishing emails, chat messages, and Facebook posts.
2. These methods deliver Windows Shortcut files.
3. The Windows Shortcut files lead to hex-encoded malicious binaries.
4. The malicious binaries are used to install persistent malware.
5. To maintain persistence, the attacker would likely set up mechanisms to execute the malware at boot or logon.

Given this sequence, the most plausible technique that would occur after the delivery of the Windows Shortcut files and the installation of persistent malware is **T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**.

**Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
