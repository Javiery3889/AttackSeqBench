### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Duke group:
1. Collected detailed bot/system information.
2. Used Seaduke to update bot configurations.
3. Uploaded files for operational control.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after these actions.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1542.005-TFTP Boot**
  - TFTP Boot is a technique where an adversary configures a system to boot from a network location using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). This is typically used for initial access or persistence, not for operational control after configuration updates.

- **B: T1602-Data from Configuration Repository**
  - This technique involves adversaries collecting data from a configuration repository, which is a central storage location for configuration data. While this could be relevant in the context of collecting bot/system information, it doesn't align with the actions of updating configurations and uploading files for operational control.

- **C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
  - Multi-hop Proxy is a technique where an adversary uses a chain of proxies to route network traffic between systems or to obfuscate the origin of the traffic. This could be used for operational control, especially after setting up the bot configurations and uploading files to maintain and manage the botnet.

- **D: T1132-Data Encoding**
  - Data Encoding involves converting data to a different format to avoid detection. This technique is often used to exfiltrate data or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. While it could be used in the context of operational control, it is more about data manipulation rather than the direct control and management of the botnet.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Duke group has already collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files for operational control.
- The next logical step would be to maintain and manage the botnet, which involves routing network traffic and maintaining communication with the bots.
- **T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy** aligns best with this scenario as it involves setting up a chain of proxies to route traffic, which is essential for maintaining operational control over the botnet.

**Final Answer: C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy**
