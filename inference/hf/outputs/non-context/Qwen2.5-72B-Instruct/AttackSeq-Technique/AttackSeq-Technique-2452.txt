### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elise malware:
1. **Defense Evasion Techniques**: The malware employs various methods to avoid detection.
2. **Communication with a Hardcoded C2 Server**: The malware establishes a connection with a command and control (C2) server.
3. **Harvesting Extensive System Information**: The malware collects detailed information about the system.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the described sequence:

- **A: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - This technique involves the malware discovering files and directories on the system. While this is a common step in information gathering, it is more specific to file and directory structures and may not encompass the broader "extensive system information" mentioned in the question.

- **B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
  - This technique involves the malware discovering the network configuration of the system, including IP addresses, network interfaces, and routing tables. This is a more comprehensive form of information gathering that aligns well with the "extensive system information" mentioned in the question.

- **C: T1564.009-Resource Forking**
  - This technique involves the malware using resource forking to hide data or code. It is more related to defense evasion and obfuscation rather than information gathering.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves the malware using application layer protocols to communicate with the C2 server. While this is a crucial step in the attack sequence, it is more about communication rather than information gathering.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Defense Evasion Techniques**: The malware uses various methods to avoid detection.
2. **Communication with a Hardcoded C2 Server**: The malware establishes a connection with a C2 server.
3. **Harvesting Extensive System Information**: The malware collects detailed information about the system.

Given the sequence, the most plausible technique for harvesting extensive system information is **T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**. This technique aligns well with the need to gather comprehensive information about the system, including network configurations, which is a critical step in understanding the environment and planning further actions.

**Final Answer: B: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery**
