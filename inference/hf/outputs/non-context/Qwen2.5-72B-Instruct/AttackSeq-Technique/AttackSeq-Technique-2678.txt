### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware ZoxPNG.
   - ZoxPNG establishes communication with a C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests containing PNG files.
   - After establishing communication, ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Communication:** ZoxPNG uses HTTP GET and POST requests to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Command Handling and Loop:** ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: T1106-Native API**
     - This technique involves adversaries using native APIs to interact with the operating system. While this could be part of the malware's operations, it doesn't specifically describe the communication and command dispatch loop.
   - **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
     - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP) to communicate with a C2 server. This aligns well with the initial communication using HTTP GET and POST requests.
   - **C: T1003.008-/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow**
     - This technique involves credential dumping from specific files on Unix-like systems. This is not relevant to the communication and command dispatch described in the question.
   - **D: T1106-Native API**
     - This is the same as choice A and has the same evaluation.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most relevant technique for the initial communication using HTTP GET and POST requests is **T1071-Application Layer Protocol**.
   - The question also mentions that ZoxPNG registers command handlers and enters a loop for communication and command dispatch. This is a common behavior for malware after establishing a C2 connection, but it doesn't specifically align with any of the other techniques listed.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
