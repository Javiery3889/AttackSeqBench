### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Initial Access**: The question states that the initial access was achieved through malicious attachments exploiting software vulnerabilities.
- **Defense Evasion**: After gaining initial access, the malware used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to evade simple file scanning.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1666-Modify Cloud Resource Hierarchy**
  - This technique involves modifying the structure of cloud resources to hide or manipulate data. It is not directly related to evading file scanning or local defense mechanisms.

- **Answer Choice B: T1552.008-Chat Messages**
  - This technique involves stealing chat messages, which is not related to defense evasion or file scanning.

- **Answer Choice C: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves using phishing to gain initial access. While it is a valid initial access technique, the question already states that initial access was achieved through malicious attachments exploiting software vulnerabilities.

- **Answer Choice D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding artifacts to evade detection. Using WMI to evade simple file scanning is a form of hiding artifacts, making this the most plausible choice.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attacker used malicious attachments to exploit software vulnerabilities and gain initial access.
2. **Defense Evasion**: After gaining access, the malware used WMI to evade simple file scanning, which is a form of hiding artifacts.
3. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A**: Not related to local defense evasion.
   - **B**: Not related to defense evasion.
   - **C**: Already used for initial access, not for defense evasion.
   - **D**: Directly related to hiding artifacts to evade detection.

**Final Answer: D: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
