  - **Relevance**: High, as it directly aligns with the initial access method described in the question (phishing messages mimicking Instagram's interface).

- **Answer Choice D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools**
  - **Description**: This technique involves compromising software dependencies and development tools to gain access to a system.
  - **Relevance**: Low, as it does not align with the initial access method described in the question (phishing).

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with phishing messages that mimic Instagram's interface.
2. **Credential Harvesting**: The goal is to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.
3. **Relevant TTP**: The most relevant TTP for this initial access and credential harvesting phase is T1566-Phishing.

**Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing**
