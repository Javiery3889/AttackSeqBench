### Step 1: Analyze the Question

The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Dexphot malware:
1. Employing software bundlers to drop its installer.
2. Using obfuscated batch scripts to evade defenses.
3. Using process hollowing to execute malicious code within legitimate system processes.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the process hollowing step.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate

Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1564-Hide Artifacts**
  - This technique involves hiding files, system artifacts, or network artifacts to avoid detection. While this could be used at various stages of the attack, it is not specifically tied to the execution of malicious code within legitimate processes.

- **B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking Component Object Model (COM) objects to execute malicious code. This could be a plausible step before process hollowing, as it can be used to gain control over legitimate processes and inject malicious code.

- **C: T1106-Native API**
  - This technique involves directly calling native APIs to perform actions. While it can be used to execute code, it is not specifically tied to the process hollowing technique.

- **D: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter**
  - This technique involves using command-line interfaces and scripts to execute commands and scripts. The question already mentions the use of obfuscated batch scripts, which aligns with this technique. However, it is not specifically tied to the process hollowing step.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Software Bundlers**: Used to drop the installer.
2. **Obfuscated Batch Scripts**: Used to evade defenses.
3. **Process Hollowing**: Used to execute malicious code within legitimate processes.

Given the sequence, the most likely technique to occur before process hollowing would be one that helps in gaining control over the legitimate processes. **T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking** fits this description well, as it can be used to hijack COM objects and gain control over legitimate processes, which can then be used for process hollowing.

**Final Answer: B: T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking**
