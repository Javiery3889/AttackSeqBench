### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Grandoreiro malware. The sequence is as follows:
1. Grandoreiro collects information about its victims, such as computer name, username, operating system version, and bitness.
2. It then uses RealThinClient SDK over HTTP for Command and Control (C2).

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1072-Software Deployment Tools**
  - This technique involves using legitimate software deployment tools to execute malicious activities. It is not directly related to the collection of victim information or the establishment of C2 communication.

- **B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) to communicate with a C2 server. This is a plausible step after collecting victim information, as the malware would need to establish a communication channel to send the collected data and receive further commands.

- **C: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning**
  - This technique involves manipulating the ARP cache to redirect network traffic. It is more related to network manipulation and does not directly follow the collection of victim information or the establishment of C2 communication.

- **D: T1555-Credentials from Password Stores**
  - This technique involves stealing credentials from password stores. While this could be a subsequent step in the attack, it is not the most immediate step after collecting basic victim information and before establishing C2 communication.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Collection of Victim Information**: The malware collects information such as computer name, username, operating system version, and bitness.
2. **Establishing C2 Communication**: The malware uses RealThinClient SDK over HTTP for C2 communication.

The most logical step between these two actions is to establish a communication channel to send the collected information and receive further commands. This aligns with the use of application layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
