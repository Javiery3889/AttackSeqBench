### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes an attack sequence where the Equation Editor vulnerability is exploited to drop the 'intel.wll' file, which maintains malware persistence upon relaunching Microsoft Word. The next step in the infection chain involves downloading and decrypting subsequent stages from a C&C server.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence described:

- **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that malware is executed automatically when the system boots or a user logs on. This aligns well with the 'intel.wll' file maintaining persistence upon relaunching Microsoft Word.

- **B: T1071.003-Mail Protocols**
  - This technique involves using mail protocols for communication. While it could be used for C&C communication, it does not fit the context of maintaining persistence or the initial exploitation.

- **C: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. The Equation Editor vulnerability is an example of this, but it is already mentioned in the question as the initial exploitation step. This does not fit the sequence of events after the initial exploitation.

- **D: T1205.002-Socket Filters**
  - This technique involves using socket filters to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This is not typically used for maintaining persistence or the initial exploitation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial step involves exploiting the Equation Editor vulnerability to drop the 'intel.wll' file.
2. The 'intel.wll' file is used to maintain persistence upon relaunching Microsoft Word.
3. The next step in the infection chain is downloading and decrypting subsequent stages from a C&C server.
4. The technique that best fits the step of maintaining persistence is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.

**Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
