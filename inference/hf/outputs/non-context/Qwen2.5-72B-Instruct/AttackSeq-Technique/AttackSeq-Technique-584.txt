### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers:
1. Gained credential access using Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
2. Used webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network.
3. Dumped credentials to further execute commands on other systems.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1114.001 - Local Email Collection**
  - This technique involves collecting email data from local email clients. It does not align with the use of webshells or executing commands on other systems.

- **B: T1055 - Process Injection**
  - This technique involves injecting code into the address space of a separate process. While it can be used for various purposes, it does not directly align with the use of webshells or remote command execution.

- **C: T1021 - Remote Services**
  - This technique involves using legitimate remote services to gain access to systems. It includes various sub-techniques, such as:
    - **T1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
    - **T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares**
    - **T1021.003 - SSH**
    - **T1021.004 - VNC**
    - **T1021.005 - Web Protocols**
    - **T1021.006 - Windows Remote Management (WinRM)**
    - **T1021.007 - Cloud Services**
  - The use of webshells to execute commands on other systems aligns well with the "Web Protocols" sub-technique (T1021.005).

- **D: T1021.007 - Cloud Services**
  - This sub-technique involves using cloud services to gain remote access. It does not align with the use of webshells on internal network systems.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The attackers gained initial credential access using Mimikatz and Impacket tools.
2. They then used webshells to execute commands on other systems within the network.
3. The use of webshells to execute commands aligns with the "Web Protocols" sub-technique (T1021.005) under the broader T1021 - Remote Services technique.

**Final Answer: C: T1021 - Remote Services**
