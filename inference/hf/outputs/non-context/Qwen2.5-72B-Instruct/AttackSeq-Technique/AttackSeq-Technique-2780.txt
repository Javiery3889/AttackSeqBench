### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where Dragonfly conducted reconnaissance using various methods (spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits) to gather information. After this reconnaissance phase, they gained initial access to energy companies using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
- **Key Phases**:
  1. **Reconnaissance**: Using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
  2. **Initial Access**: Using spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This technique involves using phishing to gather information, which aligns with the reconnaissance phase.
  - **B: T1598-Phishing for Information**: This is the same as choice A.
  - **C: T1070-Indicator Removal**: This technique involves removing or altering indicators of compromise, which is typically done after gaining access and establishing a foothold, not during the reconnaissance phase.
  - **D: T1553.004-Install Root Certificate**: This technique involves installing a root certificate, which is typically used to establish trust and can be part of the initial access or persistence phase, but it is not a reconnaissance technique.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The question asks for the technique that occurred after the reconnaissance phase but before the initial access phase.
  - **Reconnaissance Phase**: Dragonfly used spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits to gather information.
  - **Initial Access Phase**: Dragonfly used spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
  - **Technique in Between**: The technique that fits between these two phases is **T1598-Phishing for Information**. This is because it is a continuation of the reconnaissance efforts, specifically using phishing to gather more detailed information that can be used to gain initial access.

- **Final Answer**: A: T1598-Phishing for Information
