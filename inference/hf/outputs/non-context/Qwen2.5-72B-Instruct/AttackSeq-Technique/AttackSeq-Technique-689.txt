### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where the Pierogi backdoor is executed via an embedded macro in a Microsoft Word document.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely to ensure the backdoor runs upon user login.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL**
  - This technique involves loading a malicious DLL into the Terminal Services process. This is not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

- **Answer Choice B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**
  - This technique involves setting up mechanisms to ensure that the backdoor runs automatically when the user logs in. This is a common method for maintaining persistence and aligns well with the scenario described.

- **Answer Choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service**
  - This technique involves sending data to a web service, which is not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

- **Answer Choice D: T1098.005-Device Registration**
  - This technique involves registering a device with a service to gain access to resources, which is not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
