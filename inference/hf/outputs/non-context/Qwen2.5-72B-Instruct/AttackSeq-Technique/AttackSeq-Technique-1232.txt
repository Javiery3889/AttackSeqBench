### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Inception attackers.
   - They use POWERSHOWER to set up persistence by writing a script to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves collecting system details on the infected machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1598-Phishing for Information**
     - This technique involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, which is not relevant to the described scenario of collecting system details on an already infected machine.
   - **B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
     - This technique involves collecting information about the system, such as the operating system, architecture, and installed software. This aligns well with the next step of collecting system details on the infected machine.
   - **C: T1652-Device Driver Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying device drivers on the system, which is a more specific and less common next step after setting up persistence.
   - **D: T1547.009-Shortcut Modification**
     - This technique involves modifying shortcuts to maintain persistence, which is already covered by the use of a run key in the registry.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible next step in the attack sequence, given the context of collecting system details on the infected machine, is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery**
