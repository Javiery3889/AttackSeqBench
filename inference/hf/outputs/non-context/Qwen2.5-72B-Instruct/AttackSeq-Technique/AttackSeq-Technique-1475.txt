### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the SLUB backdoor.
   - The backdoor performs a discovery process by retrieving commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet and obtaining the username and computer name.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The backdoor retrieves commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet.
   - The backdoor obtains the username and computer name.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: T1485-Data Destruction**
     - This technique involves the deletion of data to disrupt or damage the target's operations.
     - It is not a logical next step after discovery and command retrieval.
   - **Answer Choice B: T1102-Web Service**
     - This technique involves the use of web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server.
     - It is a plausible next step after retrieving commands from a web service (GitHub 'gist').
   - **Answer Choice C: T1033-System Owner/User Discovery**
     - This technique involves identifying the system owner or user.
     - The question already states that the backdoor obtained the username and computer name, which is part of this technique.
     - This technique is already part of the described sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: T1102-Web Service**
     - This is the same as Answer Choice B and is a plausible next step after retrieving commands from a web service.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical next step after the backdoor retrieves commands from a GitHub 'gist' snippet and obtains the username and computer name is to use a web service to communicate with a C2 server.
   - Both Answer Choices B and D are the same and align with this reasoning.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
