### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of events where:
1. Malware is deployed through spear phishing emails.
2. The malware establishes connections to the attacker's infrastructure.
3. The connections use domains to evade network detection.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1566-Phishing**
  - This technique involves the use of phishing to gain initial access to a system. While it is part of the initial attack vector, it does not describe the subsequent step of establishing connections to the attacker's infrastructure.

- **B: T1001.002-Steganography**
  - This technique involves hiding data within other data to evade detection. While it can be used for data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communication, it is not specifically about establishing connections using domains.

- **C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
  - This technique involves using a dead drop resolver to establish a connection to a C2 server. A dead drop resolver is a method where the malware checks a predefined list of domains or URLs to find a valid C2 server. This aligns well with the description of using domains to evade network detection.

- **D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using standard application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to communicate with a C2 server. While it can be used to establish connections, it does not specifically mention the use of domains for evasion.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. The initial attack vector is spear phishing, which is covered by T1566-Phishing.
2. After gaining access, the malware needs to establish a connection to the attacker's infrastructure.
3. The question specifically mentions the use of domains to evade network detection, which is a key characteristic of T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver.

**Final Answer: C: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver**
