### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after KONNI malware executed arbitrary code on the infected host and before the stolen screenshots were uploaded to the C2 infrastructure?
- **Key Points**:
  - KONNI malware has already executed arbitrary code.
  - Stolen screenshots are to be uploaded to the C2 infrastructure.
  - We need to identify the technique that likely occurred in between these two events.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choices**:
  - **A: T1560.003-Archive via Custom Method**: This technique involves compressing data to evade detection. It is typically used to prepare data for exfiltration but is not directly related to capturing or uploading screenshots.
  - **B: T1113-Screen Capture**: This technique involves capturing screenshots or other visual data from the infected host. This is a logical step before uploading the stolen screenshots to the C2 infrastructure.
  - **C: T1497.002-User Activity Based Checks**: This technique involves checking for user activity to avoid detection. While it can be part of an attack, it is not directly related to the sequence of capturing and uploading screenshots.
  - **D: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves setting up persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware runs at boot or logon. It is not directly related to the sequence of capturing and uploading screenshots.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Arbitrary Code Execution**: KONNI malware has already executed arbitrary code on the infected host.
2. **Next Logical Step**: The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to capture the screenshots of the infected host.
3. **Screen Capture**: The technique T1113-Screen Capture fits this step perfectly, as it involves capturing visual data from the infected host.
4. **Upload to C2**: After capturing the screenshots, the malware would then upload them to the C2 infrastructure.

**Final Answer: B: T1113-Screen Capture**
