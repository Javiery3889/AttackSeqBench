### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the APT-TOCS group. The sequence is as follows:
1. Lateral movement within the internal network.
2. Communicating with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.

We need to determine which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred between these two steps.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to see which one fits best in the sequence:

- **A: T1562.004 - Disable or Modify System Firewall**
  - This technique involves disabling or modifying the system firewall to allow the attacker to maintain access or facilitate further actions. While this could be a part of the initial setup or post-exploitation, it is not typically a step that occurs between lateral movement and communication with compromised systems.

- **B: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application to gain initial access to the network. This is typically an early step in the attack lifecycle, not something that occurs after lateral movement.

- **C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
  - This technique involves using common application layer protocols (like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.) to communicate with the command and control (C2) server. This fits well with the described sequence, as it is a logical step to use HTTP GET requests to communicate with compromised systems after lateral movement.

- **D: T1573 - Encrypted Channel**
  - This technique involves using an encrypted channel to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection. While this is a common technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the question and does not align as closely with the use of HTTP GET requests.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Lateral Movement (T1021, T1077, etc.)** - The APT-TOCS group moves laterally within the internal network to gain access to additional systems.
2. **Communication with Compromised Systems** - After gaining access to the desired systems, the group uses HTTP GET requests to communicate with these systems.

The technique that fits best between these two steps is **T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**. This technique describes the use of common application layer protocols, such as HTTP, to communicate with the compromised systems, which aligns perfectly with the described sequence.

**Final Answer: C: T1071 - Application Layer Protocol**
