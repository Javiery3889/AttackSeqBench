### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a scenario where an attacker (Suckfly) has already scanned the internal network for open ports to expand its foothold.
- The next step in the attack sequence is to move laterally within the network.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking**
  - This technique involves hijacking an existing remote service session, which is not typically the next step after scanning for open ports. It is more specific to hijacking an already established session.

- **Answer Choice B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a remote service to gain access to a system. This is a logical next step after identifying open ports, as the attacker would use the open ports to exploit a service and move laterally.

- **Answer Choice C: T1558.003-Kerberoasting**
  - This technique involves requesting service ticket (TGS) requests for service accounts and then cracking the tickets offline to obtain the service account's password. While this can be used for lateral movement, it is more specific to credential theft and is not the immediate next step after scanning for open ports.

- **Answer Choice D: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application**
  - This technique involves exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application. This is typically used for initial access, not for lateral movement within an internal network.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The attacker has already scanned the internal network for open ports.
  - The next logical step is to exploit one of these open services to move laterally within the network.
  - **T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services** aligns best with this scenario, as it involves using the identified open ports to exploit a service and gain access to other systems.

**Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services**
