### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Lazarus group executed a credential harvesting tool named Responder to acquire login credentials.
- **Objective**: Determine the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after the credential harvesting.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using non-standard data encoding methods to obfuscate commands or payloads.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used to evade detection or to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. It is not directly related to the immediate actions following credential harvesting.

- **Answer Choice B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries performing discovery of files and directories on a system.
  - **Relevance**: After acquiring credentials, an attacker might perform file and directory discovery to understand the victim's environment and identify valuable data or further targets.

- **Answer Choice C: T1036-Masquerading**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries renaming or masquerading malicious files or programs to appear legitimate.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is often used to avoid detection and maintain persistence. It is not directly related to the immediate actions following credential harvesting.

- **Answer Choice D: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
  - **Description**: This is the same as Answer Choice B.
  - **Relevance**: Same as Answer Choice B.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Credential Harvesting**: The Lazarus group used Responder to harvest login credentials.
2. **Next Logical Step**: After obtaining credentials, the next logical step for an attacker is to explore the victim's environment to understand the system and identify valuable data or further targets.
3. **Relevance of T1083**: File and Directory Discovery (T1083) is a common technique used after credential harvesting to gather information about the system and its contents.

**Final Answer: B: T1083-File and Directory Discovery**
