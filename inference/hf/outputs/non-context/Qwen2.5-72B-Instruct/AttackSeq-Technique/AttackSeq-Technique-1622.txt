### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 (a known threat actor) has already performed IP range scanning and identified vulnerable systems.
- **Objective**: Determine the next ATT&CK technique used in the Discovery phase to centralize the information gathered from the scanning and identification process.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1613-Container and Resource Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves discovering containers and resources within a cloud environment.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is more relevant to cloud environments and does not align well with the context of scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

- **Answer Choice B: T1048-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exfiltrating data using alternative protocols.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is part of the Exfiltration tactic, not the Discovery tactic. It is used to move data out of the network, not to discover or centralize information.

- **Answer Choice C: T1055.009-Proc Memory**
  - **Description**: This technique involves injecting code into processes to execute it in the context of those processes.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is part of the Execution tactic and is used to run code on a system, not to discover or centralize information.

- **Answer Choice D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves identifying remote systems and their details, such as network topology, IP addresses, and system names.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is part of the Discovery tactic and aligns well with the context of scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. It is used to gather detailed information about the remote systems, which can then be centralized.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The attack sequence described involves scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
  - The next logical step in the Discovery phase would be to gather detailed information about these systems.
  - T1018-Remote System Discovery is the most relevant technique for this purpose, as it involves identifying and gathering information about remote systems.

**Final Answer: D: T1018-Remote System Discovery**
