### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes an attack sequence involving the Elfin group, which used PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging for defense evasion. After this, they deployed DarkComet to extract credentials from compromised systems.
- **Key TTPs**:
  - **PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging**: This indicates defense evasion techniques.
  - **Deploying DarkComet to extract credentials**: This suggests credential access techniques.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1595-Active Scanning**
  - **Description**: Active Scanning involves probing for information and vulnerabilities on the network.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gather information. It does not align well with the sequence described, which involves defense evasion and credential access.

- **Answer Choice B: T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging**
  - **Description**: Process Doppelgänging is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, often for persistence or to evade detection.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used for defense evasion, it is more specific to process injection and does not directly fit the context of bypassing logging or preparing for credential extraction.

- **Answer Choice C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
  - **Description**: Impair Defenses involves techniques to disable or manipulate security tools and configurations to prevent detection and response.
  - **Relevance**: This technique aligns well with the described use of PowerShell commands and other methods to bypass logging. It is a logical step in the sequence before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials, as it ensures that the attacker's actions are not logged or detected.

- **Answer Choice D: T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness**
  - **Description**: This technique involves exploiting weak file permissions on services to gain elevated privileges or to manipulate system configurations.
  - **Relevance**: While this technique can be used for privilege escalation, it does not directly fit the context of bypassing logging or preparing for credential extraction.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Initial Analysis**: The attack sequence involves defense evasion (bypassing logging) and credential access (deploying DarkComet).
2. **Evaluation of Choices**:
   - **A: Active Scanning** - Not relevant to the described sequence.
   - **B: Process Doppelgänging** - More specific to process injection, not directly related to bypassing logging.
   - **C: Impair Defenses** - Directly relevant to bypassing logging and ensuring undetected actions.
   - **D: Services File Permissions Weakness** - More relevant to privilege escalation, not directly related to bypassing logging.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves impairing defenses to bypass logging before deploying DarkComet to extract credentials.

**Final Answer: C: T1562-Impair Defenses**
