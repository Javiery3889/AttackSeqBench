### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a malicious .LNK object in an email attachment executes a PowerShell command to download and inject shellcode into `wabmig.exe`.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to ensure the RAT (Remote Access Tool) remains active even after system restarts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** The .LNK object in the email attachment is used to execute a PowerShell command.
   - **Download and Inject Shellcode:** The PowerShell command downloads and injects shellcode into `wabmig.exe`.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The question is asking about the technique used to ensure the RAT remains active after system restarts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:**
     - This technique involves setting up mechanisms that ensure the malware runs automatically when the system boots or the user logs on. This is a common method for achieving persistence.
   - **B: T1566-Phishing:**
     - This technique involves the initial delivery of the malicious payload via phishing emails. While it is part of the initial compromise, it does not address persistence.
   - **C: T1098.002-Additional Email Delegate Permissions:**
     - This technique involves gaining additional permissions to email accounts, which is not related to ensuring the RAT remains active after system restarts.
   - **D: T1574.006-Dynamic Linker Hijacking:**
     - This technique involves hijacking the dynamic linker to execute malicious code when a legitimate program is run. While it can be used for persistence, it is less common and more specific than boot or logon autostart execution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Compromise and Execution:**
   - The .LNK object in the email attachment is used to execute a PowerShell command, which is a common initial access technique (T1566-Phishing).
2. **Download and Inject Shellcode:**
   - The PowerShell command downloads and injects shellcode into `wabmig.exe`, which is a technique for executing arbitrary code (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter and T1055-Process Injection).
3. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - To ensure the RAT remains active after system restarts, the attacker would need to use a persistence technique. The most common and straightforward method for this is to set up a mechanism that runs the malware at boot or logon (T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
