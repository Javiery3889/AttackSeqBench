### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the PurpleFox malware:
1. Evaded detection using an MSI package.
2. Installed a rootkit driver.
3. Blocked incoming connections via a firewall rule.
4. Established a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice to determine which one aligns best with the attack sequence:

- **A: T1102-Web Service**
  - This technique involves adversaries using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C&C servers. While it can be used to establish communication, it doesn't specifically address the need for a bidirectional channel that is established after evading detection and setting up a rootkit.

- **B: T1205-Traffic Signaling**
  - This technique involves using legitimate protocols and services to blend in with normal network traffic. It can be used to mask C&C communications, but it doesn't specifically address the establishment of a bidirectional channel.

- **C: T1008-Fallback Channels**
  - This technique involves using alternative communication channels if the primary C&C channel is disrupted. While it is related to communication, it doesn't specifically address the initial establishment of a bidirectional channel.

- **D: T1014-Rootkit**
  - This technique involves using rootkits to maintain persistence and evade detection. While it is relevant to the earlier steps of the attack (installing a rootkit driver), it doesn't address the establishment of a bidirectional communication channel.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Evade Detection**: PurpleFox used an MSI package to install a rootkit driver, which aligns with T1014-Rootkit.
2. **Block Incoming Connections**: Setting up a firewall rule to block incoming connections is a defensive measure to prevent detection and interference.
3. **Establish Bidirectional Communication**: The next logical step is to establish a communication channel with the C&C server. The most relevant technique for this is T1102-Web Service, as it involves using legitimate web services to host and communicate with C&C servers, which can be bidirectional.

Given the sequence of actions, the most plausible technique for establishing a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers is T1102-Web Service.

**Final Answer: A: T1102-Web Service**
