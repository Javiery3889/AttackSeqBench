### Step 1: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C (Command and Control) servers to coordinate its malicious activities. 

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice:

- **A: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking**
  - Compute Hijacking involves using the victim's computational resources for the attacker's purposes, such as mining cryptocurrency. This is not typically a next step after C&C communication in the context of BlackEnergy, which is known for its destructive and espionage capabilities.

- **B: T1001-Data Obfuscation**
  - Data Obfuscation involves altering data to make it less understandable or detectable. This technique is often used to hide the nature of the data being exfiltrated or to evade detection. While it can occur after C&C communication, it is not the most likely next step in the context of BlackEnergy's typical attack patterns.

- **C: T1485-Data Destruction**
  - Data Destruction involves the deletion or corruption of data on the victim's systems. BlackEnergy is known for its destructive capabilities, and after establishing C&C communication, it is plausible that the next step would be to destroy data to achieve its objectives, such as causing disruption or covering tracks.

- **D: T1657-Financial Theft**
  - Financial Theft involves stealing financial information or funds. While this is a common goal for many malware, BlackEnergy is more associated with destructive and espionage activities rather than financial theft.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Compute Hijacking (T1496.001)**: Not a typical next step for BlackEnergy.
2. **Data Obfuscation (T1001)**: Possible but not the most likely next step.
3. **Data Destruction (T1485)**: Highly plausible given BlackEnergy's known capabilities.
4. **Financial Theft (T1657)**: Not a primary goal of BlackEnergy.

Given the context and the known capabilities of BlackEnergy, the most plausible next step after C&C communication would be **Data Destruction**.

**Final Answer: C: T1485-Data Destruction**
