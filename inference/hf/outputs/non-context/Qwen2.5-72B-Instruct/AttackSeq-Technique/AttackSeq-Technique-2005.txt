### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- The question describes a sequence of events where a script named `Scr.js` fingerprints the infected system and saves the output.
- After this, the KopiLuwak backdoor begins communicating with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **T1135-Network Share Discovery**: This technique involves an adversary discovering network shares on a system. It is not relevant to the communication with compromised websites.
- **T1572-Protocol Tunneling**: This technique involves using a protocol to encapsulate another protocol, often to bypass network security. While it could be used for communication, it is not the most direct fit for the described scenario.
- **T1102-Web Service**: This technique involves using legitimate web services to communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This fits well with the scenario where the backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites.
- **T1053-Scheduled Task/Job**: This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to execute malicious code. It is not directly related to the communication with websites.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Fingerprinting and Output Saving**: The initial step where `Scr.js` fingerprints the system and saves the output is not directly related to the communication phase.
2. **Communication with Compromised Websites**: The key part of the question is the communication with two compromised legitimate websites to receive and send commands. This is a clear indication of command and control (C2) communication.
3. **Relevance of T1102-Web Service**: The use of compromised legitimate websites to communicate with the backdoor aligns well with the T1102-Web Service technique, which involves leveraging web services for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service**
