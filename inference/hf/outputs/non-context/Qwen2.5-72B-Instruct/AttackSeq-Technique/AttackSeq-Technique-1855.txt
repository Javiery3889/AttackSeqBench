### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The VERMIN malware has already set up persistence via a scheduled task and obfuscated its code for defense evasion.
- **Next Step**: The malware is collecting system-related details such as machine name, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1069.003-Cloud Groups**
  - **Description**: This technique involves identifying and enumerating cloud groups and roles.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the collection of system-related details on a local machine.

- **Answer Choice B: T1610-Deploy Container**
  - **Description**: This technique involves deploying a container to execute code or host a service.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the collection of system-related details on a local machine.

- **Answer Choice C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
  - **Description**: This technique involves adversaries attempting to get information about the system and its configuration, such as machine name, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.
  - **Relevance**: This is highly relevant to the described action of collecting system-related details.

- **Answer Choice D: T1056-Input Capture**
  - **Description**: This technique involves capturing user input, such as keystrokes, screen captures, and other forms of input.
  - **Relevance**: This is not relevant to the collection of system-related details on a local machine.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The VERMIN malware has already set up persistence and obfuscated its code.
  - The next logical step is to gather information about the system it has infected.
  - The technique that best fits this description is T1082-System Information Discovery, as it involves collecting system-related details such as machine name, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.

**Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery**
