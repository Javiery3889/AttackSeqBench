### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The question describes a scenario where the Gamaredon group has used a backdoor to list interesting files on the system during the discovery phase. The next step in the attack sequence involves gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares.
- **TTPs Mentioned**: The question focuses on the technique used to gather sensitive documents after the discovery phase.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: T1596.002-WHOIS**
  - **Description**: This technique involves querying WHOIS databases to gather information about domain names and IP addresses.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not relevant to gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, or network shares. It is more about gathering information about domain and IP registrations.

- **Answer Choice B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**
  - **Description**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the collection of sensitive documents. It is more about manipulating trust mechanisms.

- **Answer Choice C: T1119-Automated Collection**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using automated tools to collect data from the system, including files, documents, and other sensitive information.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is highly relevant to the scenario described. After listing interesting files, the next logical step would be to use automated tools to collect these files.

- **Answer Choice D: T1213.001-Confluence**
  - **Description**: This technique involves using Confluence, a collaboration and documentation tool, to gather information.
  - **Relevance**: This technique is not directly related to the collection of sensitive documents from the local system, drives, or network shares. It is more about using a specific tool for collaboration and documentation.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Context Analysis**: The question describes a scenario where the attacker has already discovered interesting files and is now looking to gather sensitive documents.
2. **Relevance of Techniques**:
   - **T1596.002-WHOIS**: Not relevant to document collection.
   - **T1553-Subvert Trust Controls**: Not relevant to document collection.
   - **T1119-Automated Collection**: Highly relevant to document collection.
   - **T1213.001-Confluence**: Not relevant to document collection.
3. **Conclusion**: The most plausible technique for gathering sensitive documents from the local system, drives, and network shares after the discovery phase is **T1119-Automated Collection**.

**Final Answer: C: T1119-Automated Collection**
