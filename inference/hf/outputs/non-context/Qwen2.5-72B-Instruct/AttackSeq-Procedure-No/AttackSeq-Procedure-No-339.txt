### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Nemesis bootkit.
   - The bootkit evades detection by executing before the Windows operating system fully loads.
   - It bypasses typical operating system integrity checks.
   - The question asks whether the bootkit will achieve persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR) only afterward.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Understanding Bootkits:**
     - Bootkits are a type of malware that infects the boot sector of a hard drive or other storage device. They are designed to load before the operating system, allowing them to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Volume Boot Record (VBR):**
     - The VBR is a section of a hard drive that contains the code necessary to boot the operating system. Infecting the VBR is a common method for bootkits to achieve persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The bootkit evades detection by executing before the OS loads.
     - It bypasses integrity checks.
     - The question implies that the bootkit might infect the VBR only after these initial steps.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Execution:**
     - The bootkit must first execute before the OS loads to evade detection and bypass integrity checks.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - To achieve persistence, the bootkit needs to ensure it can load every time the system boots. Infecting the VBR is a common and effective method for this.
   - **Timing:**
     - The question asks if the bootkit will infect the VBR only after evading detection and bypassing integrity checks. Given the nature of bootkits, it is more likely that the VBR infection is part of the initial infection process to ensure persistence from the start.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The bootkit is likely to infect the VBR as part of its initial infection process to ensure it can load every time the system boots, rather than waiting to do so afterward.

### Final Answer: B: No
