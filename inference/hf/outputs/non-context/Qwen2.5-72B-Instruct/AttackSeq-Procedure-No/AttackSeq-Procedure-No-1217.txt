### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compressing and encrypting stolen data.
     - Exfiltrating the data over a C2 (Command and Control) channel.
     - Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives during the collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T9000 (Tactic: Exfiltration, Technique: Data Compression and Encryption):**
     - T9000 is a technique used for compressing and encrypting data before exfiltration. This is typically done to reduce the size of the data and make it harder to detect.
   - **Exfiltration over C2 Channel:**
     - After compressing and encrypting the data, the next logical step is to exfiltrate it over a C2 channel. This is a common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - **Stealing Sensitive Data from Skype Communications and Removable Drives:**
     - Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives is a data collection activity. This typically occurs before the data is compressed, encrypted, and exfiltrated.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the data has already been compressed, encrypted, and exfiltrated.
   - Stealing sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives would logically occur before the data is compressed and encrypted, not after.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that T9000 would then steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives after the data has already been exfiltrated.

### Final Answer:
B: No
