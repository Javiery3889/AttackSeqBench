### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - It then mentions an encoded PowerShell script that is retrieved via a VBS macro.
   - The final step involves downloading payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious Word documents are a common initial access vector. This part of the sequence is plausible.
   - **Encoded PowerShell Script:**
     - Encoded PowerShell scripts are often used in malware to obfuscate the malicious code and evade detection. This is a common technique.
   - **VBS Macro:**
     - VBS macros in Word documents can be used to execute the encoded PowerShell script. This is a typical sequence in many malware attacks.
   - **Downloading Payloads:**
     - Once the PowerShell script is executed, it can download additional payloads. Ursnif and GandCrab are known malware families that can be delivered in this manner.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Phishing email with a malicious Word document.
     2. VBS macro in the Word document retrieves and executes an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. The PowerShell script downloads payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with common attack patterns.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a typical attack flow.

### Final Answer:
B: No

**Reasoning:**
The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a typical attack flow. However, the question asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute **only** before being retrieved via a VBS macro. This phrasing is incorrect because the PowerShell script is typically retrieved and then executed, not the other way around. Therefore, the correct answer is "No" because the sequence as described in the question is not accurate. The correct sequence should be that the VBS macro retrieves and then executes the encoded PowerShell script.
