### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
     - Standing up websites containing malicious JavaScript to profile potential victims or infect them via a fake software update.
     - Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FamousSparrow is known to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to gain initial access. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Web Presence and Malicious JavaScript:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for threat actors to set up web infrastructure to further their attack. This can include standing up websites with malicious JavaScript to profile victims or deliver additional payloads.
   - **Using `cmd.exe` to Download and Install Backdoor:**
     - Once the initial foothold is established and additional infrastructure is set up, threat actors often use command-line tools like `cmd.exe` to download and install backdoors. This is a common technique to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical progression of TTPs that aligns with the known behavior of FamousSparrow.
   - The use of initial vulnerabilities to gain access, followed by setting up web infrastructure for further exploitation, and then using command-line tools to install a backdoor is a well-documented attack pattern.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
