### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Get-NetComputer command from PowerView**: This is used for remote system discovery.
     - **SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites**: This is used for initial compromise.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Get-NetComputer command from PowerView**:
     - This command is part of the PowerView script, which is a collection of PowerShell functions used for network enumeration and discovery.
     - It is typically used in the **Discovery** phase of an attack to identify potential targets within a network.
   - **SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites**:
     - SocGholish is a framework used for social engineering and phishing attacks.
     - It is often used in the **Initial Access** phase to gain a foothold in the target network by tricking users into downloading malware or providing credentials.
   - **Sequence Analysis**:
     - In a typical attack sequence, the **Initial Access** phase comes before the **Discovery** phase.
     - Therefore, it is more logical for the attackers to use the SocGholish framework to gain initial access before using the Get-NetComputer command to discover remote systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, it is not likely that the attackers will use the Get-NetComputer command before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

**Final Answer: B: No**
