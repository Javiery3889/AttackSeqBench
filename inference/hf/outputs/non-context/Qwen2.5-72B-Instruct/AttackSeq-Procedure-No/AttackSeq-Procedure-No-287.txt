### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Elfin group, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence involves deploying malware tools (Notestuk and Stonedrill), exploiting a specific vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250), and the method of delivery (spear-phishing emails).
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Elfin would scan for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure before delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Deploying Malware Tools (Notestuk and Stonedrill)**
     - Notestuk and Stonedrill are known malware tools used by Elfin for various purposes, including initial access and persistence.
   - **Step 2: Exploiting CVE-2018-20250**
     - CVE-2018-20250 is a specific vulnerability that Elfin might exploit to gain access to a target system.
   - **Step 3: Method of Delivery (Spear-Phishing Emails)**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common method for delivering malware and exploits.
   - **Step 4: Scanning for Vulnerable Websites**
     - Scanning for vulnerable websites is a common reconnaissance technique used to identify potential targets or to set up C&C infrastructure.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Target Identification:**
     - Before delivering an exploit via spear-phishing emails, it is common for threat actors to perform reconnaissance to identify vulnerable targets. This includes scanning for vulnerable websites.
   - **C&C Infrastructure:**
     - Setting up C&C infrastructure often involves identifying and compromising servers or websites that can be used to control the compromised systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described in the question (scanning for vulnerable websites before delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails) aligns with a logical and common attack pattern. Threat actors typically gather intelligence and set up infrastructure before launching the actual attack.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of actions and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is likely that Elfin would scan for vulnerable websites to identify targets or create C&C infrastructure before delivering the exploit via spear-phishing emails.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
