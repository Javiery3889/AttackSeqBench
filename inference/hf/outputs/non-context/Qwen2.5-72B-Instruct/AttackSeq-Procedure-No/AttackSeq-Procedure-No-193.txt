### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Elise malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence through the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
     - Enumerating running processes as part of the discovery phase.
     - Distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document to facilitate initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document to facilitate initial access. This is a common technique used by malware to gain a foothold on a system, often through phishing or social engineering.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the malware achieves persistence by modifying the Run Registry key. This ensures that the malware is executed every time the system starts.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The question asks if the malware will enumerate running processes as part of its discovery phase only after distributing the malicious document.
     - Typically, the discovery phase (enumerating running processes) occurs after the malware has gained initial access and established persistence. This is because the malware needs to be active on the system to perform such actions.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Distribute a malicious Microsoft Word document to gain initial access.
     2. Achieve persistence through the Run Registry key.
     3. Enumerate running processes as part of the discovery phase.
   - The question specifically asks if the enumeration of running processes happens only after the distribution of the malicious document.
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs, the enumeration of running processes would indeed occur after the initial access and persistence have been established.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The enumeration of running processes as part of the discovery phase would not occur only after distributing the malicious Microsoft Word document. It would occur after the malware has gained initial access and established persistence.
