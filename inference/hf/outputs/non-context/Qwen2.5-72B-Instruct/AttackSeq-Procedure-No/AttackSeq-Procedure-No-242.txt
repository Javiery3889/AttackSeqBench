### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **System Information Discovery:** The malware executes commands to gather information about the system.
     - **Exfiltration to C&C Server:** The gathered information is sent back to the Command and Control (C&C) server.
     - **Network Sniffer Module:** The malware uses a network sniffer to capture user credentials being transmitted over the network.
     - **Communication with C&C Infrastructure:** The malware attempts to communicate with its C&C infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery and Exfiltration:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. The malware gathers information about the system to understand its environment and capabilities.
     - The information is then exfiltrated to the C&C server for further analysis and decision-making by the attacker.
   - **Network Sniffer Module:**
     - Using a network sniffer to capture user credentials is a technique often employed in the **Credential Access** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
     - This step is typically performed to gain additional access to the network and to escalate privileges.
   - **Communication with C&C Infrastructure:**
     - Communication with the C&C infrastructure is a continuous process throughout the attack. However, the question implies a specific sequence where the network sniffer is used before attempting further communication with the C&C server.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. System Information Discovery
     2. Exfiltration to C&C Server
     3. Network Sniffer Module
     4. Communication with C&C Infrastructure
   - This sequence is plausible because:
     - After gathering and exfiltrating system information, the attacker might use the network sniffer to capture additional credentials to gain more access.
     - Once the credentials are captured, the malware might need to communicate with the C&C server to report the new findings or receive further instructions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is plausible. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
