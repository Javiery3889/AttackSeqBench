### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.
   - The question then asks whether these collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This implies that the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This implies that the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI:**
     - Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts is a common technique used by attackers to gather information. This is part of the data collection phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration is a separate phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. While collecting email accounts is a step in the data collection process, exfiltration involves sending the collected data to a remote server.
   - **Automatic Exfiltration:**
     - The question specifically asks about automatic exfiltration over FTP. While exfiltration can be automated, it is not an inherent part of the data collection process. The attacker would need to set up a separate mechanism to exfiltrate the data, which is not automatically triggered by the collection process itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the collection of email accounts from contacts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI does not automatically lead to exfiltration over FTP. The exfiltration step would require additional configuration or actions by the attacker.

### Final Answer: B: No
