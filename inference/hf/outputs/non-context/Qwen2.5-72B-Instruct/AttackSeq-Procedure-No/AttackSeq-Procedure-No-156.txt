### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10:
     - Using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2).
     - Transferring data using tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP).
   - The question then asks if APT10 is likely to exfiltrate data using the MIME protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2:**
     - APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Data Transfer Tools:**
     - Robocopy and PSCP are legitimate tools often used for file transfer and synchronization. APT10 has been known to use such tools to transfer data within the network or to exfiltrate data.
   - **MIME Protocol for Exfiltration:**
     - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for formatting messages to include non-ASCII characters and attachments. It is commonly used in email systems.
     - APT10 is known for using various exfiltration methods, but MIME is not a typical method for data exfiltration in the context of APT10's known TTPs. APT10 typically uses more direct methods like FTP, HTTP, or custom protocols for exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 and tools like Robocopy and PSCP for data transfer, it is less likely that they would use the MIME protocol for exfiltration. MIME is more commonly associated with email and not typically used for data exfiltration in APT10's known TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
