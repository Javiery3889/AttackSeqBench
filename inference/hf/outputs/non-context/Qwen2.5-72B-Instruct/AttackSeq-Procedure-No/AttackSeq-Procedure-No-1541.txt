### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is gained via a phishing campaign delivering malware disguised as a Curriculum Vitae.
   - The question asks whether the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain `judystevenson[.]info` only after using other identified C2 domains.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing campaign delivering malware. This is a common initial access technique (T1566 in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Malware Communication:** Malware typically communicates with a C2 server to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain persistence. This communication can happen immediately after the initial infection or after a delay.
   - **Sequence of C2 Domains:** The question implies a sequence where the malware might use multiple C2 domains. However, it does not specify that the malware must use other C2 domains before communicating with `judystevenson[.]info`.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Immediate Communication:** Malware often communicates with its C2 server immediately after infection to establish a connection and receive further instructions. This is a common behavior to ensure the attacker can control the compromised system as soon as possible.
   - **Multiple C2 Domains:** While it is possible for malware to use multiple C2 domains, the question does not provide enough information to conclude that the malware will only communicate with `judystevenson[.]info` after using other domains.
   - **Default Behavior:** Without additional context, it is more plausible that the malware will communicate with the primary C2 domain (`judystevenson[.]info`) as soon as it is executed, rather than waiting to use other domains first.

### Final Answer:
B: No
