### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an obfuscated batch script is used to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`).
   - The final step involves communication for command and control (C2).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Obfuscated batch script execution.
   - **Intermediate TTP:** Execution of `myScript.ps1` PowerShell script.
   - **Final TTP:** Communication for C2.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the final PowerShell script will use Telnet for C2.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the final PowerShell script will not use Telnet for C2, but rather another method, such as njRAT.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Telnet for C2:**
     - Telnet is a simple and outdated protocol that is not commonly used for C2 in modern malware. It lacks encryption and is easily detectable, making it a poor choice for sophisticated attackers.
   - **njRAT for C2:**
     - njRAT (also known as Bladabindi) is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that is frequently used for C2. It provides a more sophisticated and stealthy method for attackers to control compromised systems.
   - **Context of the Question:**
     - The use of an obfuscated batch script and a PowerShell script suggests a more advanced and stealthy approach, which aligns more with the use of a RAT like njRAT rather than a simple and detectable protocol like Telnet.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
