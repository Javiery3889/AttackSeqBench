### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
     - Utilizing tools like Mimikatz or PwDump for credential theft.
     - Form-grabbing techniques to extract data from web data forms.
     - Identifying systems of interest.
     - Staging data in multi-part archives.
     - Placing the data in the Recycle Bin.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance and Credential Theft:**
     - APT10 is known for conducting internal reconnaissance and using tools like Mimikatz for credential theft. This aligns with the initial steps described in the question.
   - **Form-Grabbing Techniques:**
     - Form-grabbing techniques are typically used to capture data entered into web forms, often in the context of web-based attacks or malware that targets web browsers. APT10 is more known for targeting network infrastructure and internal systems rather than web forms.
   - **Identifying Systems of Interest, Staging Data, and Placing in Recycle Bin:**
     - These steps are consistent with APT10's known TTPs. They often identify valuable systems, stage data for exfiltration, and use techniques to hide their activities, such as placing data in the Recycle Bin.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Steps:**
     - APT10 would likely conduct internal reconnaissance and use tools like Mimikatz for credential theft. This is a common and well-documented TTP for APT10.
   - **Form-Grabbing Techniques:**
     - While form-grabbing is a technique used in some cyber attacks, it is not a typical TTP for APT10. APT10 is more focused on network infiltration and data exfiltration from internal systems.
   - **Subsequent Steps:**
     - Identifying systems of interest, staging data, and placing it in the Recycle Bin are all consistent with APT10's known TTPs. These steps are part of their data exfiltration process.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the form-grabbing technique is not a typical TTP for APT10. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for APT10 would not include form-grabbing techniques.

**Final Answer: B: No**
