### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware "Longhorn."
   - The sequence includes:
     - System fingerprinting
     - Exfiltration during the collection phase
     - System information discovery as part of discovery operations
     - Defense evasion techniques like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting and Exfiltration:**
     - These are typical initial steps in an attack where the malware gathers information about the target system and exfiltrates data.
   - **System Information Discovery:**
     - This is a discovery operation where the malware gathers more detailed information about the system, such as network configuration, user accounts, and system architecture.
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation are techniques used to avoid detection and analysis by security tools and researchers.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if Longhorn is likely to perform system information discovery only after employing defense evasion techniques.
   - In a typical attack sequence, an attacker might use defense evasion techniques early to avoid detection, but system information discovery is often a necessary step to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - It is plausible that Longhorn would use defense evasion techniques before or during system information discovery to ensure that the discovery process itself does not trigger alerts.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the nature of advanced malware, it is reasonable to assume that defense evasion techniques would be employed early in the attack to maintain stealth.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Longhorn would use defense evasion techniques before or during system information discovery.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
