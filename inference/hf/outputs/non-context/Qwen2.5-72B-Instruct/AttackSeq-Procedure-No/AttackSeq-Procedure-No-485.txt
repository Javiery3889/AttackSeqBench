### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access).
     2. Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
     3. Collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types (Discovery).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (Mimikatz):** This is a common initial step where the attacker gains access to credentials, which can be used to move laterally within the network or to gain higher privileges.
   - **Exfiltration of File Contents:** After gaining access to the system, the attacker might read and exfiltrate sensitive files to the C&C server. This is typically done to gather valuable data that can be used for further attacks or for financial gain.
   - **Discovery of System Information:** This step involves gathering information about the system to understand its environment, which can help in planning further actions. This includes collecting usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining credentials, an attacker would likely exfiltrate valuable data before or during the discovery phase. The discovery phase is often used to gather information that can help in further exploitation, but it is not uncommon for exfiltration to occur early in the attack to ensure the data is secured.
   - FamousSparrow, known for its sophisticated attack patterns, would likely prioritize exfiltrating valuable data as soon as possible to minimize the risk of detection and to ensure the data is secure.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
