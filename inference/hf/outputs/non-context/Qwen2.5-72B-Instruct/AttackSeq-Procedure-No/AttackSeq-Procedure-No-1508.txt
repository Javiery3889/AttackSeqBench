### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RIG Exploit Kit (EK).
   - The sequence in question is: 
     1. Creating system services to execute cryptocurrency mining software.
     2. Running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RIG Exploit Kit (EK) Overview:**
     - RIG EK is a well-known exploit kit that typically uses vulnerabilities in web browsers and plugins to deliver malware.
     - It often uses obfuscated JavaScript or other scripting languages to exploit vulnerabilities and download additional payloads.
   - **Creating System Services for Cryptocurrency Mining:**
     - While RIG EK can be used to deliver various types of malware, including cryptocurrency miners, it is less common for it to create system services specifically for this purpose.
     - Typically, RIG EK focuses on delivering the initial payload, which may then perform additional actions like mining.
   - **Running an Obfuscated PowerShell Script:**
     - It is common for RIG EK to use obfuscated PowerShell scripts to download and execute additional malware.
     - This is a typical technique used to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves creating system services for cryptocurrency mining before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
   - While RIG EK can deliver cryptocurrency miners, the creation of system services for this purpose is not a typical initial step in its attack sequence.
   - The more common sequence would be to use an obfuscated script to download and execute the malware, which may then include a cryptocurrency miner as part of its payload.
