### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.
     2. Obtaining credential information from `/etc/shadow` using the `shadow.py` module.
     3. Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Using trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords during privilege escalation.**
     - This is a plausible first step. Trojans are often used to gain initial access and log credentials, which can then be used for privilege escalation.
   - **Step 2: Obtaining credential information from `/etc/shadow` using the `shadow.py` module.**
     - The `/etc/shadow` file contains hashed passwords for user accounts on Unix-like systems. Accessing this file typically requires root or administrative privileges.
     - Using a module like `shadow.py` to extract this information is a logical next step after gaining elevated privileges.
   - **Step 3: Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.**
     - Once the attacker has obtained credentials and elevated privileges, they would likely want to gather more information about the network and host to plan further actions.
     - Using native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance is a common tactic in the post-exploitation phase.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and follows a typical attack pattern:
     1. Initial access and credential harvesting.
     2. Privilege escalation and credential extraction.
     3. Internal reconnaissance.
   - There is no reason to believe that FIN13 would skip the step of obtaining credential information from `/etc/shadow` before moving on to internal reconnaissance.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
