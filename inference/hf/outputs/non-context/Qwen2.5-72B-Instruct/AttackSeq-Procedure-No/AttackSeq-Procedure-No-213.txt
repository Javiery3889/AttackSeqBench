### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milestone backdoor and asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM after performing system information discovery and screen capture.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:** The question mentions that these functionalities are performed.
   - **Defense Evasion using DKOM:** The question asks if the Fire Chili kernel rootkit is deployed for Defense Evasion using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring persistence is a common initial step in many attack sequences to maintain access to the compromised system.
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:** These are typical reconnaissance and data collection activities that occur after gaining initial access and ensuring persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion using DKOM:** Deploying a kernel rootkit like Fire Chili for Defense Evasion using DKOM is a more advanced and sophisticated step. It is often used to hide the presence of the malware and maintain stealth.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Persistence:** The backdoor ensures it can survive system reboots.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker gathers information about the system and captures screens to understand the environment.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** The attacker then deploys a kernel rootkit to avoid detection and maintain stealth.
   - This sequence is consistent with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like Deep Panda, which are known for their sophisticated and multi-stage attack techniques.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical progression and the typical behavior of APTs, it is plausible that Deep Panda would deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for Defense Evasion using DKOM after performing system information discovery and screen capture.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
