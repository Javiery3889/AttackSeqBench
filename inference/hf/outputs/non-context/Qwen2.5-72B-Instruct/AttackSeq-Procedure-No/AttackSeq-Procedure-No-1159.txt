### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether other macOS malware (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CloudMensis) would likely employ their respective mechanisms for gaining initial access only after CrateDepression has dropped its payloads.
   - The key points to consider are:
     - The sequence of events: CrateDepression dropping payloads first.
     - The likelihood of other malware gaining initial access after this event.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CrateDepression:**
     - Drops Poseidon payloads via a malicious crate named 'rustdecimal.'
     - This is a specific method of delivering malware, typically used to gain initial access or to execute further stages of an attack.
   - **Alchimist, ChromeLoader, and CloudMensis:**
     - These are other macOS malware that have their own methods for gaining initial access.
     - Alchimist: Often uses malicious documents or email attachments.
     - ChromeLoader: Typically uses browser hijacking or malicious extensions.
     - CloudMensis: Often uses malicious cloud storage links or phishing.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access Mechanisms:**
     - Each of these malware families (Alchimist, ChromeLoader, CloudMensis) has distinct and independent methods for gaining initial access to a system.
     - These methods are designed to be effective on their own and do not typically depend on the presence of other malware or the success of other malware's payload delivery.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - It is unlikely that these malware would wait for CrateDepression to drop its payloads before attempting to gain initial access.
     - Malware typically operates independently to maximize the chances of successful infection and to avoid detection by waiting for other malware to act first.
   - **Operational Independence:**
     - Malware authors and operators often work independently and do not coordinate their attacks in a way that one malware waits for another to complete its task.
