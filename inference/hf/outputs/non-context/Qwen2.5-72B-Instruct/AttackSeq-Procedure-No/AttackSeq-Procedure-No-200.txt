### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
     - Using Nmap to map the network.
     - Using Mimikatz to collect credentials.
   - The question then asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
     - PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that can be used for lateral movement in a network. It is often used by attackers to distribute malware and other tools once they have gained access to a network.
     - Given that the GreyEnergy group has already compromised a computer, mapped the network, and collected credentials, it is plausible that they would use a tool like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the GreyEnergy group will not use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
     - While it is possible that the group might use other methods for lateral movement, the use of a legitimate tool like PDQ Deploy is a common and effective technique for distributing malware and tools in a compromised network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described and the common practices of advanced threat actors, it is more plausible that the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
