### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **PowerShell injection** using the `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` PowerSploit module.
     - **Network service scanning** using tools like `pscan` and `nmap`.
     - **Using the SombRAT backdoor** for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell Injection:**
     - The use of `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` is a common technique for executing malicious payloads in memory without writing to disk, which is a stealthy method to avoid detection.
   - **Network Service Scanning:**
     - Tools like `pscan` and `nmap` are typically used in the reconnaissance phase to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the network.
   - **SombRAT Backdoor:**
     - SombRAT is a backdoor that can perform various post-compromise activities, including process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible but not necessarily the most common or logical order of operations.
     - Typically, an attacker would first perform reconnaissance (network service scanning) to gather information about the target network before deploying a backdoor or executing a payload.
     - However, the question specifically mentions that the PowerShell injection is performed first, which suggests that the attacker has already gained some level of access to the target system.
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker might then use network service scanning to map the network and identify additional targets.
     - Finally, the SombRAT backdoor would be used to maintain persistence and perform further reconnaissance on the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While the sequence is not the most common, it is still plausible. The attacker might have used PowerShell injection to gain initial access, then performed network service scanning to map the network, and finally deployed the SombRAT backdoor for further activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
