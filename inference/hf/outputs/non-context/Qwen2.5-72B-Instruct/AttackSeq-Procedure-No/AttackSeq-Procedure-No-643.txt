### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a malware might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Keylogging
     - Clipboard logging
     - Screen recording
     - Collecting system information (OS version)
     - Ensuring persistence (adding a startup program or system service)

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging, Clipboard Logging, and Screen Recording:**
     - These are techniques used for data collection. They are typically employed to gather sensitive information from the victim's system.
   - **Collecting System Information:**
     - Collecting system information, such as the OS version, is often done early in the attack to understand the environment and tailor further actions. This information can help the attacker decide which exploits to use or how to proceed with the attack.
   - **Ensuring Persistence:**
     - Ensuring persistence is a critical step for maintaining long-term access to the victim's system. This is typically done after initial reconnaissance and data collection to ensure that the malware can survive system reboots and other disruptions.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect system information only after ensuring persistence.
   - Based on the typical attack sequence:
     - **Initial Reconnaissance and Data Collection:**
       - Collecting system information (OS version) is often done early to understand the environment.
     - **Data Collection:**
       - Keylogging, clipboard logging, and screen recording are performed to gather sensitive data.
     - **Ensuring Persistence:**
       - Adding a startup program or system service is done to maintain long-term access.

   - Therefore, it is more likely that the malware will collect system information before ensuring persistence, not after.

### Final Answer:
B: No
