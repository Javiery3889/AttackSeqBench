### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Nemesis bootkit has achieved persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Volume Boot Record (VBR) Infection:**
     - The VBR is a critical part of the boot process, and infecting it allows the malware to gain early control over the system.
     - This early control can be used to load additional malware components or to manipulate the system in various ways.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Malware often employs various techniques to evade detection, including placing files in directories that are typically excluded from scanning.
     - Common directories that are often excluded from scanning include system directories, temporary directories, and user-specific directories.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the Nemesis bootkit has already achieved persistence at a very low level (VBR), it is highly likely that it would use additional evasion techniques to maintain its presence and avoid detection.
     - Placing install files in directories that are excluded from scanning is a common and effective evasion technique.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that the Nemesis bootkit would use such evasion techniques to avoid detection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
