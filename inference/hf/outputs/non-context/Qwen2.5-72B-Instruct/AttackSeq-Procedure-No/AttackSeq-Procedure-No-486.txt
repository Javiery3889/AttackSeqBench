### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Credential Access**: Dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.
     2. **Discovery**: Retrieving metadata for files on disk and listing the current working directory.
     3. **Exfiltration**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: Using Mimikatz to dump credentials is a common technique for gaining access to additional credentials, which can be used to move laterally within a network or to gain higher privileges.
   - **Discovery**: After gaining access, it is logical for an attacker to perform discovery to understand the environment and identify valuable data. Retrieving metadata for files and listing the current working directory are typical discovery actions.
   - **Exfiltration**: Once the attacker has identified valuable data, the next step is to exfiltrate it. Reading file contents and sending them to a C&C server is a common exfiltration technique.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is plausible.
   - **B: No**: This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not plausible.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Credential Access** to gain initial access and additional credentials.
     2. **Discovery** to understand the environment and identify valuable data.
     3. **Exfiltration** to send the identified data to the attacker's server.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like FamousSparrow.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
