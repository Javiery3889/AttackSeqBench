### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Command and Control (C2) capabilities by a tool called "Infamous Chisel."
   - The C2 capabilities mentioned include SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) functionality, a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel would perform discovery activities such as enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network using the `netd` component.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Capabilities:**
     - SCP functionality allows for secure file transfers.
     - A local Socks connection can be used to proxy traffic.
     - An SSH server and client enable secure remote access and command execution.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Enumerating multiple data directories is a common discovery technique to understand the file system and identify valuable data.
     - IP scanning of the local network is another discovery technique to map the network and identify other potential targets.
   - **`netd` Component:**
     - The `netd` component is typically associated with network discovery and management tasks, which aligns with the IP scanning activity mentioned.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Infamous Chisel has established robust C2 capabilities, it is logical that the next step in the attack sequence would be to perform discovery activities to gather more information about the compromised environment.
   - The use of the `netd` component for IP scanning is consistent with the goal of network discovery, which is a common follow-up action after establishing C2.
   - Enumerating data directories is also a logical step to understand the file system and identify sensitive data that could be exfiltrated or used for further attacks.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
