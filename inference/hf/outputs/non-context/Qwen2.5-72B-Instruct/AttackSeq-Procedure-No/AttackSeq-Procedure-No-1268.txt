### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - SocGholish is a type of malware that is often used to gain initial access to a victim's system. Once the initial access is gained, attackers typically look for ways to expand their foothold and gather more information about the environment.
     - Enumerating AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, is a common discovery technique used by attackers to understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
     - This sequence aligns with the typical attack lifecycle, where initial access is followed by reconnaissance and discovery.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is unlikely for the attackers to enumerate AWS infrastructure after gaining initial access using SocGholish.
     - However, this does not align with the typical behavior of sophisticated attackers, who often perform extensive reconnaissance after gaining initial access to identify valuable assets and plan further actions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical attack lifecycle and the common behavior of attackers, it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish, the attackers will enumerate AWS infrastructure for discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
