### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) to gain initial access.
     2. Using a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
     3. Dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) via a system configuration file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper is known to exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access to a target system. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **DLL Injection:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is plausible that Tropic Trooper would use a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into a legitimate process like dllhost.exe. This technique is known as process injection and is used to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Backdoor Installer:**
     - Finally, dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) via a system configuration file is a common method to ensure the backdoor is installed and persists across system reboots.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 is a known initial access technique used by Tropic Trooper.
   - **DLL Injection:**
     - Using a malicious DLL loader (wab32res.dll) to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe is a logical next step to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Backdoor Installer:**
     - Dropping a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) via a system configuration file is a common method to ensure the backdoor is installed and persists across system reboots.
