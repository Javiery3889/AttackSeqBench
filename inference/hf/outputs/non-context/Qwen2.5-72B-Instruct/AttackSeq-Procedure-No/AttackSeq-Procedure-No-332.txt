### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Derusbi malware.
   - The malware gathers system information and beacons this data to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via destination port 443.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2)**
   - **Technique: Standard Application Layer Protocol (e.g., HTTPS)**
   - **Port: 443 (HTTPS)**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will use Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for its C2 interactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port 443 (HTTPS):** This port is commonly used for secure web traffic, which is why it is often used by malware to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive:** These are cloud storage services that can be used for various purposes, including data exfiltration and C2 communications. However, they typically use their own APIs and protocols, which may not necessarily use port 443 in the same way as standard HTTPS traffic.
   - **C2 Interactions:** Malware often uses standard protocols like HTTPS to communicate with C2 servers because it is less likely to be blocked or flagged by network security measures. Using cloud storage services for C2 can be more complex and may require additional steps to establish and maintain communication.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While it is possible for malware to use cloud storage services for C2, it is less common and more complex compared to using standard HTTPS traffic on port 443.
   - The use of port 443 suggests that the malware is likely using a more straightforward and common method for C2 communications, such as direct HTTPS requests to a C2 server.

### Final Answer:
B: No
