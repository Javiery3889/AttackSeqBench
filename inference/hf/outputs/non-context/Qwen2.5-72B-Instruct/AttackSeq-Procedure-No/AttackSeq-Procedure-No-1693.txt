### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components (including the Graphite malware) only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** CVE-2021-40444 (Client Execution)
   - **PowerShell Execution:** Empire stager
   - **Acquisition of Domains and Development of Malware:** Graphite malware

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Exploit (CVE-2021-40444):** This is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is typically the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **PowerShell Execution (Empire stager):** After gaining initial access, attackers often use PowerShell to execute a stager, which is a small piece of code that downloads and executes additional malware. This is a common next step in the attack sequence.
   - **Acquisition of Domains and Development of Malware:** These activities are typically part of the preparation phase of an attack, which occurs before the initial exploitation. Acquiring domains and developing malware are usually done in advance to ensure that the attack can be carried out smoothly.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers acquired domains and developed malware only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager. However, this is unlikely because:
     - **Preparation Phase:** Acquiring domains and developing malware are typically done before the initial exploitation to ensure that the attack can be executed effectively.
     - **Logical Sequence:** It is more logical that the attackers would have already prepared the domains and malware before exploiting the vulnerability and using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical attack sequence and the logical flow of TTPs, it is unlikely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malware only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

### Final Answer: B: No
