### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The attack starts with a spear-phishing attack that exploits an Adobe Flash vulnerability.
   - The exploit is delivered through links to `show.swf` files hosted on `rpt.perrydale[.]com` and `report.perrydale[.]com`.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash exploit `show.swf` will attempt to evade defenses by embedding a payload in an animated GIF image `b.gif` and then executing shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing and Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails to victims, often with malicious links or attachments.
     - The links provided (`rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf` and `report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf`) are used to deliver the Flash exploit.
   - **Exploiting Adobe Flash:**
     - Adobe Flash has been a frequent target for exploits due to its widespread use and numerous vulnerabilities.
     - The `show.swf` file is likely a malicious Flash file designed to exploit a known vulnerability.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Attackers often use various techniques to evade detection and defenses.
     - Embedding a payload in an animated GIF image (`b.gif`) is a known evasion technique. This can help bypass simple file type checks and signature-based detection.
   - **Execution of Shellcode:**
     - Once the exploit is successful, the next step is often to execute shellcode.
     - Using embedded ActionScript classes to execute shellcode is a plausible method, as ActionScript can be used to manipulate the Flash environment and execute arbitrary code.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with known attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing to deliver a malicious Flash file.
     2. **Exploitation:** The Flash file exploits a vulnerability.
     3. **Evasion:** The payload is embedded in an animated GIF to evade detection.
     4. **Execution:** Shellcode is executed using embedded ActionScript classes.
   - Each step in the sequence is a logical and plausible progression of the attack.
