### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through watering hole tactics.
   - The initial access exploits CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - The question asks whether attackers will execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation only before using the PowerShell loader.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a watering hole attack, which is a common initial access technique.
     - The vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 are exploited to gain initial access.
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is a common next step in an attack sequence to gain higher-level access.
     - However, the question specifically asks if the attackers will execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation **only** before using the PowerShell loader.
   - **PowerShell Loader:**
     - The PowerShell loader is typically used to download and execute additional payloads, which can include backdoors, but it is not necessarily tied to privilege escalation alone.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers are using the PowerShell loader to download and execute additional payloads.
   - Privilege escalation is a step that can occur at various points in the attack sequence, but it is not necessarily the only step before using the PowerShell loader.
   - The attackers might use the PowerShell loader to achieve multiple objectives, including but not limited to privilege escalation.

### Final Answer:
B: No
