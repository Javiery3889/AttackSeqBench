### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sednit group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **COM object hijacking for persistence** by adding custom registry keys.
     - **Distributing Zebrocy components** through spearphishing emails.
     - Using a **Stage-1 downloader** to download and execute a new downloader.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **COM object hijacking for persistence:** This technique is used to ensure that the malware persists across system reboots. It involves modifying the Windows registry to execute a malicious component when a specific COM object is invoked.
   - **Distributing Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails:** Zebrocy is a malware family associated with the Sednit group. Spearphishing emails are a common initial access vector used to deliver malware.
   - **Using a Stage-1 downloader:** A Stage-1 downloader is typically used to download and execute additional malware components. This is often a multi-stage process where the initial payload is small and its primary function is to fetch and run more complex malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests a multi-stage attack:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attackers use spearphishing emails to deliver Zebrocy components.
     2. **Persistence:** Once the initial access is gained, they use COM object hijacking to ensure the malware persists.
     3. **Additional Malware Deployment:** After establishing persistence, they use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute additional malware components.
   - The order of these steps is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     - **Initial Access** is typically the first step in any attack.
     - **Persistence** is often established early to ensure the attacker can maintain control over the compromised system.
     - **Additional Malware Deployment** follows to expand the attacker's capabilities and achieve their objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common TTPs used by the Sednit group, the most plausible answer is that the operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails to gain initial access, then use COM object hijacking for persistence, and finally use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute additional malware.

**Final Answer: B: No** 

The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. The correct sequence should be:
1. **Initial Access** through spearphishing emails.
2. **Persistence** using COM object hijacking.
3. **Additional Malware Deployment** using a Stage-1 downloader.
