### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments.
   - The Taidoor malware is dropped and a decoy document is opened for initial access.
   - The question asks whether Taidoor is likely to perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2012-0158**: This vulnerability is a well-known remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office. It is often used to drop malware via malicious documents.
   - **Taidoor Malware**: Taidoor is a malware known for its use in targeted attacks, particularly in Taiwan. It often includes features to evade detection and analysis.
   - **Anti-sandboxing and Anti-virtualization Checks**: These are common techniques used by malware to detect if they are running in a sandbox or virtual environment. If detected, the malware may alter its behavior to avoid analysis.
   - **CnC Communication**: Malware often communicates with CnC servers to receive commands or exfiltrate data. Using a modified traffic pattern can help evade network-based detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access**: The use of CVE-2012-0158 to drop Taidoor and open a decoy document is a typical initial access technique.
   - **Evasion Techniques**: Given that Taidoor is known for its use in targeted attacks, it is highly likely that it would include anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks to avoid detection and analysis.
   - **CnC Communication**: The use of a modified traffic pattern to communicate with CnC servers is a common evasion technique to avoid network-based detection.
