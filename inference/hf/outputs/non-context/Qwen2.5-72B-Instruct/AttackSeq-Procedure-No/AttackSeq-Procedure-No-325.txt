### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the XAgent app.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Discovery:** Collecting a list of processes.
     2. **Exfiltration:** Sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 (Command and Control) server.
     3. **Persistence/Execution:** Hiding the app icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (Collecting Processes):** This is a common initial step in many malware operations to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Exfiltration (Sending Data to C2):** After gathering information, malware typically sends it to a C2 server for further analysis or to receive additional commands.
   - **Persistence/Execution (Hiding Icon and Running in Background):** This step is often taken to maintain a low profile and avoid detection by the user. However, the specific mention of "iOS 7 devices only" is crucial.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **iOS 7 Specificity:** The question specifies that the app will hide its icon and run in the background only on iOS 7 devices. This is a very specific condition that might be less common in modern malware, as iOS 7 is quite outdated and less likely to be a primary target for current threats.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described (discovery, exfiltration, then persistence) is logical and aligns with typical malware behavior. However, the specific condition of running only on iOS 7 devices is unusual and might be less likely in a real-world scenario.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the specific condition of running only on iOS 7 devices, which is an outdated and less relevant target, the sequence described is less likely to be the most plausible.

### Final Answer:
B: No
