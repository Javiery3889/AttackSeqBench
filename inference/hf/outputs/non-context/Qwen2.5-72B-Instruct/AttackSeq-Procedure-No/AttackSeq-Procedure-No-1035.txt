### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are consistent with the behavior of APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers.
     - Using valid user accounts.
     - Exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours.
     - Lateral movement.
     - Using Mimikatz for credential theft.
     - Accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
     - Deploying Trochilus.
     - Copying the NTDS.DIT database file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT10 Background:**
     - APT10 is a well-known cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2009.
     - They are known for targeting a wide range of industries, including technology, telecommunications, and government.
     - APT10 has a history of using sophisticated techniques for initial access, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
   - **TTPs Analysis:**
     - **Initial Access:**
       - Logging in via Citrix servers using valid user accounts is a common initial access technique used by APT10.
     - **Lateral Movement:**
       - Using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with specific working hours (Tianjin, China) is a tactic to blend in with normal network activity and avoid detection.
     - **Credential Theft:**
       - Using Mimikatz to steal credentials is a well-documented technique used by APT10 to gain additional access and move laterally within the network.
     - **Access to Domain Controller:**
       - Accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller is a critical step for gaining control over the network and deploying further malware.
     - **Deployment of Trochilus:**
       - Trochilus is a backdoor used by APT10 to maintain persistence and control over compromised systems.
     - **Copying NTDS.DIT:**
       - Copying the NTDS.DIT database file is a method to exfiltrate all user credentials from the domain controller, which can be used for further attacks or data exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly consistent with the known behavior of APT10.
   - Each step in the sequence aligns with the tactics and techniques that APT10 has been known to use in past campaigns.
   - The use of valid user accounts, Mimikatz, and the deployment of Trochilus are all well-documented in CTI reports and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
