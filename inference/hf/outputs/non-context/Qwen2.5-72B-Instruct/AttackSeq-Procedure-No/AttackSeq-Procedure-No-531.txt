### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the Dropping Elephant backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Iterating through password stores.
     - Stealing Google Chrome credentials.
     - Evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts.
     - Downloading additional malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to use the described TTPs to evade defenses and download additional malware.
     - This aligns with common APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) behavior, where malware often uses multiple stages to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
     - Decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell scripts is a known technique for evading defenses, as it can obfuscate the true nature of the commands being executed.
     - Downloading additional malware is a common next step after gaining initial access and stealing credentials.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not likely to use the described TTPs.
     - This would be less plausible because it contradicts the typical behavior of sophisticated malware, which often includes multiple stages of attack and evasion techniques.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.
   - The Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to use the described techniques to evade defenses and download additional malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
