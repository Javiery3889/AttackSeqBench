### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS) servers to establish initial access to victim systems before targeting Kavach, a multi-factor authentication (MFA) app used by the Government of India.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question involves:
     - Gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services (ADSync and ADFS).
     - Establishing initial access to victim systems.
     - Targeting Kavach, an MFA app.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services (ADSync and ADFS) can be a method to gain initial access to victim systems. These keys can be used to authenticate and gain access to the network.
     - Once initial access is established, the attacker can then target specific applications, such as Kavach, which is an MFA app.
     - This sequence aligns with common attack patterns where attackers first gain access to the network and then move laterally to target specific applications or systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the answer is no, it implies that SideCopy would not gather encryption keys from Azure AD services to establish initial access.
     - This would mean that SideCopy would use a different method to gain initial access, which is less likely given the context of targeting a government MFA app, where security measures are typically robust.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of targeting a government MFA app, it is more plausible that SideCopy would use a sophisticated method to gain initial access, such as gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.
   - This approach aligns with the typical TTPs of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, which often involve multi-stage attacks to bypass security measures.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
