### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting data from network shared drives.
     - Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.
     - Using tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services.
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Collection and Targeting:**
     - FIN13 is known to collect data from network shared drives and target specific information for fraudulent transactions. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gather valuable data.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Using tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement is a plausible next step. Invoke-WMIExec is a PowerShell script used for executing commands on remote systems via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), and BUSTEDPIPE is a custom web shell that can be used to maintain access and execute commands on compromised systems.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance is a logical step after gaining initial access and moving laterally. This helps the attacker understand the network topology, identify valuable targets, and plan further actions.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Data Collection:**
     - FIN13 starts by collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions. This is a common initial step to gather valuable data and understand the environment.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After collecting the initial data, FIN13 uses tools like Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE to move laterally within the network. This allows the attacker to access other systems and expand their control.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Once lateral movement is achieved, FIN13 leverages native OS binaries and custom malware to perform internal reconnaissance. This helps the attacker map the network, identify additional targets, and plan further actions.
