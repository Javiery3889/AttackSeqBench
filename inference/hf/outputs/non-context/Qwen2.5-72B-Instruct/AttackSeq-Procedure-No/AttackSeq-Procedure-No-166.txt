### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
     - Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
     - Leveraging shared MSP (Managed Service Provider) infrastructure.
     - Staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of techniques for lateral movement, including credential theft and token manipulation. Abusing SAML tokens is a sophisticated method that can be used to gain access to other systems within the network.
     - However, APT10 is also known to leverage shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally, especially in environments where MSPs have broad access to multiple client networks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT10 is not likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement and will instead leverage shared MSP infrastructure.
     - Leveraging shared MSP infrastructure is a common technique used by APT10 to move laterally, as it allows them to access multiple client networks through a single compromised MSP account.
     - While SAML token abuse is a valid technique, it is not as commonly associated with APT10 as leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the known TTPs of APT10, leveraging shared MSP infrastructure is a more common and effective method for lateral movement in their operations.
   - While SAML token abuse is a sophisticated technique, it is not as frequently used by APT10 as leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.

### Final Answer: B: No
