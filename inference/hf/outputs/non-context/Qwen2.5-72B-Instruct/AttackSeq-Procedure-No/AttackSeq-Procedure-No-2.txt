### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
   - The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will query the registry for installed applications as part of software discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (T1547):** The malware adds Intel-related files to registry run keys to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a common technique for achieving persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1036):** The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable to avoid detection by security software. This is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - **Software Discovery (T1082):** Querying the registry for installed applications is a common technique for software discovery. This helps the malware understand the environment it is operating in and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After achieving persistence and evading defenses, it is logical for the malware to gather information about the system to plan its next steps.
   - Querying the registry for installed applications is a common and effective way to discover what software is present on the system.
   - This information can be used to identify potential targets, determine the presence of security tools, or find vulnerabilities to exploit.

### Final Answer:
