### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by CozyDuke.
   - CozyDuke establishes persistence using methods like registry modifications or COM-object hijacking.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that CozyDuke would communicate with its C&C (Command and Control) server using the Jabber/XMPP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Techniques:**
     - CozyDuke is known to use various persistence mechanisms, including registry modifications and COM-object hijacking. These techniques are common in malware to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts or when certain events occur.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The choice of C&C communication protocol is crucial for the malware to maintain control over the infected system.
     - Jabber/XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is a protocol used for instant messaging and presence information. It is known for its use in legitimate communication applications but has also been used by some malware for C&C communication due to its ability to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **CozyDuke's Known C&C Communication:**
     - CozyDuke, also known as CozyBear, is a sophisticated threat actor associated with the APT29 group. While it has been known to use various C&C communication methods, including HTTP and HTTPS, there is no widely documented evidence of CozyDuke specifically using Jabber/XMPP for C&C communication.
     - The use of HTTP and HTTPS is more common and aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated APT groups, which often prefer protocols that are less likely to be blocked by network security measures.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known behavior of CozyDuke and the typical C&C communication methods used by sophisticated APT groups, it is less likely that CozyDuke would use Jabber/XMPP for C&C communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
