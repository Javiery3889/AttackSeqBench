### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the InfoOS module and the XAgent component.
   - The InfoOS module gathers system information such as IOPlatformUUID and operating system version.
   - The XAgent component is expected to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - The communication is expected to occur via the HTTPChannel module.
   - The question asks if the XAgent component communicates with the C&C server only after sending a hello message.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **InfoOS Module:**
     - This module is responsible for gathering system information, which is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This information is often used to determine the next steps in the attack, such as which exploits to use or what data to exfiltrate.
   - **XAgent Component:**
     - XAgent is a component of the malware that is responsible for communicating with the C&C server. This communication is crucial for receiving further commands and instructions.
   - **HTTPChannel Module:**
     - This module is used for communication over HTTP, which is a common protocol for C&C communication due to its widespread use and ability to blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **Hello Message:**
     - Sending a hello message is a common practice in C&C communication. It is often used to establish a connection and confirm the presence of the infected machine to the C&C server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common TTPs in cyber attacks:
     1. **Gather System Information:**
        - The InfoOS module gathers system information to prepare for further actions.
     2. **Establish C&C Communication:**
        - The XAgent component would typically need to establish a connection with the C&C server.
     3. **Send Hello Message:**
        - Sending a hello message is a standard step to confirm the connection and readiness to receive commands.
     4. **Receive Commands:**
        - After the hello message, the XAgent component would receive further commands from the C&C server.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical order of operations for a cyber attack.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
