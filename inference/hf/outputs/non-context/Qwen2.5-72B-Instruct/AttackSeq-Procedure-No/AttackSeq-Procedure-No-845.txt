### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The attack involves delivering KerrDown to targets using malicious Microsoft Office documents with macros or RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture and contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture and will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Office document will not use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture and will not contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Base64 Blobs:**
     - Base64 encoding is commonly used to encode binary data in a text format, which can be useful for embedding malicious payloads in documents. However, the question does not specify that base64 blobs are a necessary part of the attack sequence.
   - **System Architecture:**
     - It is common for malware to check the victim's system architecture (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit) to ensure compatibility and effective execution. However, the question does not provide specific evidence that this is a required step in the attack.
   - **Image File Instructing to Enable Macros:**
     - Malicious Office documents often contain social engineering elements, such as images or text, to trick the victim into enabling macros. This is a common technique to bypass security warnings and execute the malicious payload.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While the use of base64 blobs and system architecture checks are plausible, they are not explicitly mentioned as necessary steps in the attack sequence described. However, the presence of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros is a common and well-documented technique in such attacks.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros, but the use of base64 blobs and system architecture checks are not necessarily part of the described sequence.

### Final Answer: B: No
