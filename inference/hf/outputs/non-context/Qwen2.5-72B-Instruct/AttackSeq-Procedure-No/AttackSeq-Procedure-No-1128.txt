### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the NewsBeef group gains initial access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks using malicious macro-enabled Office documents.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic as part of the campaign's execution phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The NewsBeef group uses spearphishing and watering hole attacks with malicious macro-enabled Office documents. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The question specifically mentions the use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) in Word documents to execute PowerShell commands.
     - DDE is a known technique used to execute commands or scripts, often used to deliver malware.
   - **Malware Delivery:**
     - JHUHUGIT and Koadic are known malware families.
     - JHUHUGIT is a backdoor, and Koadic is a post-exploitation framework.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would use DDE to execute PowerShell commands to deliver additional malware like JHUHUGIT and Koadic. This is a common tactic in multi-stage attacks to maintain persistence and expand their foothold in the network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is a plausible attack sequence.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that Word documents will execute PowerShell commands through DDE to deliver JHUHUGIT and Koadic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
