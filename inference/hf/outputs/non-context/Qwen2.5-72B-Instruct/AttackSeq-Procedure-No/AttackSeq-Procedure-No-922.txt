### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
     - Using these documents for lateral movement via compromised systems.
     - Searching victim collaboration channels (like MS Teams or Slack) for sensitive information during the collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Injecting Malicious Macros:**
     - This is a common technique used by various threat actors, including Gamaredon, to gain initial access and execute malicious code on victim systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, threat actors often use various techniques to move laterally within the network to gain access to more systems and data.
   - **Searching Collaboration Channels:**
     - Collaboration channels like MS Teams and Slack are rich sources of sensitive information, such as credentials, internal communications, and business-critical data.
     - It is a logical step for an advanced threat actor to search these channels during the collection phase to gather as much information as possible.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that Gamaredon’s malware will search victim collaboration channels for sensitive information.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is unlikely that Gamaredon’s malware will search victim collaboration channels for sensitive information.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the advanced nature of the Gamaredon group and their known tactics, it is highly plausible that they would search collaboration channels for sensitive information. This aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors who aim to maximize the value of their compromise by gathering as much data as possible.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
