### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware:
     1. The malware uses the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information.
     2. The gathered information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
     3. The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will:
        - Encrypt the C2 (Command and Control) data.
        - Convert the encrypted data into a hexadecimal representation.
        - Encode the hexadecimal data into base64.
        - Contact the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Encryption of C2 Data:**
     - Encrypting C2 data is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the communication between the malware and the C2 server.
   - **Hexadecimal Representation:**
     - Converting data into a hexadecimal representation is not a standard practice in C2 communications. It is more common to use base64 encoding directly.
   - **Base64 Encoding:**
     - Base64 encoding is a standard method to encode binary data into a text format, which is often used in C2 communications to ensure the data can be transmitted over protocols that expect text data.
   - **Contacting a Domain:**
     - After gathering and sending initial system information, it is plausible that the malware would contact a domain for further instructions or to exfiltrate more data.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is mostly plausible, but the step of converting the data into a hexadecimal representation before base64 encoding is not a common practice. Typically, data is directly encrypted and then base64 encoded.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence would be:
     1. Gather system information.
     2. Send the information to the initial C2 server.
     3. Encrypt the C2 data.
     4. Encode the encrypted data into base64.
     5. Contact the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

### Final Answer:
B: No
