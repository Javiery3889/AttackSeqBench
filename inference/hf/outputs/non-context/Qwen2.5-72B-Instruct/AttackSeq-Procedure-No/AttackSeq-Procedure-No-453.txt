### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts.
     - Command and control (C2) operations.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT-TOCS will then exhibit lateral movement through network projection within the internal network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell for Downloading Encrypted Data Scripts:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts. This is a common technique for initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
     - Once the initial access is established, attackers typically set up C2 channels to maintain control over the compromised system and to exfiltrate data or execute further commands.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a technique used by attackers to move from one system to another within a network. This is often done to spread the infection, gain additional access, and achieve the attacker's objectives.
   - **Network Projection:**
     - Network projection involves the use of network tools and techniques to map and explore the internal network, identify potential targets, and plan the next steps in the attack.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that APT-TOCS has already used PowerShell to download scripts and established C2 operations, it is highly likely that the next step would be to explore the internal network and move laterally.
   - Lateral movement is a common next step after gaining initial access and setting up C2, as it allows the attacker to spread and gain deeper access to the network.
   - Network projection is a crucial part of lateral movement, as it helps the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
