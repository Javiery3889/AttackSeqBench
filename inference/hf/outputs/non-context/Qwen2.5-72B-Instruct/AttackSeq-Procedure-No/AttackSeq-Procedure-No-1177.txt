### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the malware FoggyWeb.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Downloading additional components from a C2 server.
     2. Exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.
     3. Passively monitoring HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb will passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that FoggyWeb will not passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Download Additional Components:**
     - This is a common initial step in many malware operations, where the malware downloads additional components to enhance its capabilities.
   - **Exfiltrate Configuration Database and Certificates:**
     - Exfiltrating sensitive data such as configuration databases and certificates is a critical step in many attacks, especially those targeting authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - **Passive Monitoring of HTTP Requests:**
     - After exfiltrating the necessary data, it is plausible that the malware would then monitor HTTP requests to gather more information or to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical malware behavior. After downloading additional components and exfiltrating sensitive data, the malware would likely move on to monitoring HTTP requests to further its objectives.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
