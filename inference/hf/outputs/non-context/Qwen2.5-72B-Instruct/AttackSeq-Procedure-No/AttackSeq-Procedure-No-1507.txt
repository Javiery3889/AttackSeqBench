### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites only after running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Malvertising:** This involves the use of online advertising to spread malware.
   - **Redirecting Users:** This involves redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites.
   - **Obfuscated PowerShell Script:** This involves running an obfuscated PowerShell script.
   - **Fetching Malware:** This involves using the Command and Scripting Interpreter to fetch malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RIG Exploit Kit (EK):** RIG EK is known for delivering exploits through malvertising. It typically works by redirecting users to malicious websites where the exploit kit can execute.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Malvertising and Redirecting Users:** RIG EK often starts by using malvertising to redirect users to malicious websites.
     - **Obfuscated PowerShell Script:** While RIG EK can use various methods to deliver malware, it is not typical for it to run an obfuscated PowerShell script as the first step in the sequence. Instead, it usually delivers the exploit directly or through a download mechanism.
     - **Fetching Malware:** The Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) can be used to fetch malware, but this is usually a later step in the attack sequence, not the initial step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question, where RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter only after redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites, is not the most typical or likely sequence for RIG EK.

### Final Answer: B: No
