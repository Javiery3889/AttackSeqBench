### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     - Using a backdoor to list interesting files (such as Office documents) during the discovery phase.
     - Capturing passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window as part of data collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Inserting Malicious Macros:**
     - This is a common technique used by various threat actors, including Gamaredon, to maintain persistence and execute malicious code.
   - **Using a Backdoor for Discovery:**
     - Once the macros are executed, the backdoor can be used to perform discovery, which involves identifying and listing interesting files on the victim's system.
   - **Capturing Passwords via GUI Prompt:**
     - The question suggests that the malware will capture passwords by prompting the victim with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window.
     - This technique is more specific to macOS and involves social engineering to trick the user into providing their credentials.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Gamaredon's Known TTPs:**
     - Gamaredon is known for using a variety of TTPs, including the use of malicious macros and backdoors for persistence and data exfiltration.
     - However, the specific technique of using a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window to capture passwords is less commonly associated with Gamaredon's known activities.
   - **Platform Consistency:**
     - The use of a macOS-specific GUI prompt suggests that the attack is targeting macOS systems. Gamaredon is more commonly associated with Windows-based attacks, although they have been known to target other platforms as well.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the first two steps (inserting malicious macros and using a backdoor for discovery) are consistent with Gamaredon's known TTPs, the third step (capturing passwords via a macOS-specific GUI prompt) is less likely to be part of their typical attack sequence.
   - The use of a macOS-specific technique in this context seems out of place and less plausible given Gamaredon's primary focus on Windows-based attacks.

### Final Answer:
B: No
