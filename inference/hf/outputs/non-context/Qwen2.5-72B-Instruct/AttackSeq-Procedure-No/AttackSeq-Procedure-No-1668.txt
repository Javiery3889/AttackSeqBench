### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the TDrop2 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Process Hollowing:** A technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process.
     - **Obfuscation of the Second-Stage Payload:** A method to evade detection by making the payload difficult to analyze.
     - **Collection of the MAC Address:** A discovery activity to gather information about the infected host.
     - **Communication with C2 Servers:** Using encrypted and encoded commands to communicate with command and control servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Hollowing and Obfuscation:**
     - These are common techniques used in the initial stages of an attack to gain a foothold and evade detection.
   - **Collection of the MAC Address:**
     - This is a typical discovery activity. Malware often collects system information to understand the environment it is operating in, which can help in further stages of the attack.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - After gaining a foothold and collecting necessary information, malware typically establishes communication with C2 servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Infection and Evasion:**
        - The malware uses process hollowing to inject itself into a legitimate process and obfuscates its payload to avoid detection.
     2. **Discovery:**
        - Once the malware is running, it collects information about the host, such as the MAC address, to understand the environment.
     3. **C2 Communication:**
        - After gathering necessary information, the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands to maintain stealth and receive further instructions.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
