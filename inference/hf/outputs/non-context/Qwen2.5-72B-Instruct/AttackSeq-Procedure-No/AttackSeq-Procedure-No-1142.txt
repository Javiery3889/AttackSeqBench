### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has conducted reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan.
   - The attacker has identified Building Management Systems (BMS) with the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The use of masscan for scanning and identifying BMS and unauthenticated printer web interfaces is part of the reconnaissance phase. This phase involves gathering information about the target environment.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase typically involves exploring the network and systems to gather more detailed information. This can include identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
   - **Metadata and File Listings:**
     - Retrieving metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings is a more detailed form of information gathering that typically occurs after initial reconnaissance. It involves accessing file systems and directories, which is a step beyond just identifying open ports and services.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The reconnaissance phase using masscan and identifying BMS and unauthenticated printer web interfaces is focused on network-level information.
   - The discovery phase, which follows reconnaissance, can involve more detailed exploration, including accessing file systems and directories.
   - Given that the question asks about the discovery phase, it is plausible that the attacker would attempt to retrieve metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings as part of this phase.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
