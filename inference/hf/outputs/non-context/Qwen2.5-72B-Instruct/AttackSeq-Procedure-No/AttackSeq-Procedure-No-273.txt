### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Korplug variant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a custom TCP-based protocol to communicate with C&C servers.
     - Collecting system information such as uptime, Windows version, and CPU clock rate.
     - Establishing persistence by creating a scheduled task or registry entry to run the executable from a hidden system directory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Korplug variant collects system information only after establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Korplug variant does not necessarily collect system information only after establishing persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Establishing persistence is a common tactic used by malware to ensure it can run again after a system reboot or other disruptions. This is typically done by creating a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collecting System Information:**
     - Collecting system information is often one of the first actions taken by malware to understand the environment it is operating in. This information can be used to tailor further actions, such as determining the best way to establish persistence or identifying valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is more common for malware to collect system information early in the infection process to gather necessary details before taking further actions, such as establishing persistence. This is because the information collected can influence how the malware proceeds.
     - Therefore, it is less likely that the Korplug variant would wait to collect system information until after it has established persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
