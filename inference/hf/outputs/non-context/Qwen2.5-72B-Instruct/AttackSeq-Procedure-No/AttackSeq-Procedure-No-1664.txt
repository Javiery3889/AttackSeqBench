### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the LightNeuron malware.
   - LightNeuron collects emails based on specified rules and exfiltrates local files through automated collection methods.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that LightNeuron would use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C&C) communication instead of emails, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071 (Application Layer Protocol).

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that LightNeuron would use FTP for C&C communication.
     - FTP is a common protocol for file transfer, but it is not typically used for C&C communication in malware. C&C communication often uses more covert and less easily detectable methods, such as HTTPS, DNS, or custom protocols.
     - LightNeuron is known for its use of email for both data exfiltration and C&C communication, which aligns with its nature as a backdoor that leverages email infrastructure.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that LightNeuron would not use FTP for C&C communication.
     - Given that LightNeuron is designed to use email for both data exfiltration and C&C communication, it is more plausible that it would continue to use email rather than switch to FTP for C&C.
     - Using email for C&C is a known and effective method for LightNeuron, and switching to FTP would be less stealthy and more detectable.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is more plausible that LightNeuron would continue to use email for C&C communication rather than switch to FTP.

**Final Answer: B: No**
