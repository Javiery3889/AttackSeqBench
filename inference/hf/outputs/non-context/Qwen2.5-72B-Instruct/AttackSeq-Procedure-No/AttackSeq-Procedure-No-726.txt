### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Stuxnet.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Exploiting the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability.
     - Exploiting the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Stuxnet will use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication to send system information and receive commands or updates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stuxnet's Known TTPs:**
     - Stuxnet is a sophisticated piece of malware that was designed to target specific industrial control systems, particularly those used in Iran's nuclear program.
     - Stuxnet is known for its use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, including MS08-067 and MS10-061, for initial infection and lateral movement.
     - For C2 communication, Stuxnet used a variety of methods, including:
       - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:** Stuxnet could communicate with other infected machines within the same network to share information and updates.
       - **HTTP and HTTPS Protocols:** Stuxnet used these protocols to communicate with its C2 servers.
       - **Covert Channels:** Stuxnet used hidden channels within legitimate network traffic to avoid detection.
   - **FTP Protocol:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network.
     - While FTP is a common protocol, it is not typically used for C2 communication in sophisticated malware like Stuxnet. FTP is more prone to detection and is less stealthy compared to other protocols like HTTP/HTTPS or P2P.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Stuxnet and its known use of more stealthy and secure communication methods, it is unlikely that Stuxnet would use FTP for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
