### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a malware named SkinnyBoy.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
     - The C2 server is identified as `updaterweb[.]com`.
     - The communication method is an HTTP POST request.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the C2 traffic is obfuscated using an altered version of base64.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Obfuscation of C2 traffic is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and analysis.
     - Base64 encoding is a popular method for obfuscation, and malware often uses altered or custom versions of base64 to further complicate detection.
     - Given that SkinnyBoy is communicating with a C2 server, it is plausible that it would use some form of obfuscation to hide its traffic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the malware does not obfuscate its C2 traffic, it would be more easily detected by network security tools.
     - This would be less likely for a sophisticated malware that aims to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in malware development and the need to evade detection, it is more plausible that SkinnyBoy would obfuscate its C2 traffic using an altered version of base64.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
