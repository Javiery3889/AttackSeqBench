### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
   - After gaining initial access, the question asks if it is likely that ProjectM will use WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) in scripts for remote execution and system surveys.
   - Finally, the question asks if ProjectM will employ techniques to evade defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of malicious RTF and Excel files to exploit known vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the initial phase of the attack.
   - **WMI for Remote Execution and System Surveys:**
     - WMI is a powerful tool that can be used for remote execution and system surveys. It is often used by attackers to gather information about the compromised system and to execute commands remotely. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Evading defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors to maintain operational security and avoid detection. This is typically done after the initial reconnaissance and exploitation phases to ensure the attacker's infrastructure remains hidden.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:
     1. **Initial Access:** Using malicious files to exploit vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution and Reconnaissance:** Using WMI for remote execution and system surveys.
     3. **Evasion:** Employing techniques to evade defense measures.
   - This sequence is consistent with the typical attack lifecycle and the capabilities of advanced threat actors like ProjectM.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
