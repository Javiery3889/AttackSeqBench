### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware "Smooth Operator."
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file during the discovery stage.
     2. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers.
     3. Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json` during the collection stage.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Stage:**
     - Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file is a common discovery technique. This helps the malware understand the environment it is operating in.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers is typically done after the initial discovery to establish a command and control channel. This allows the malware to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - **Collection Stage:**
     - Parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json` is a collection technique. This is often done to gather specific data that the malware is interested in.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The logical sequence of TTPs would be:
     1. **Discovery:** Collect OS version from `SystemVersion.plist`.
     2. **C2 Communication:** Establish HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers.
     3. **Collection:** Parse and extract domain and account name values from `3CX` file `config.json`.

   - The question asks if Smooth Operator is likely to perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers **before** parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the `3CX` file `config.json`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs, it is logical for the malware to establish C2 communication before proceeding to the collection stage. This ensures that the malware can receive further instructions or exfiltrate data as needed.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
