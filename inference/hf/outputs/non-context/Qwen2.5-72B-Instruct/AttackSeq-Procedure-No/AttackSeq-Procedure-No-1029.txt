### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for a malware called PyFlash.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with a hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Using AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption.
     - Operating on ports like 8,000 for C&C operations.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that PyFlash will gather system information (systeminfo, tasklist, arp) as part of the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Tactic: Command and Control (C2):**
     - The malware communicates with a hardcoded C&C server, which is a common TTP for maintaining control over the compromised system.
   - **Tactic: Defense Evasion:**
     - Using AES-128 in CBC mode for encryption helps evade detection by making network traffic less suspicious.
   - **Tactic: Discovery:**
     - Gathering system information (systeminfo, tasklist, arp) is a typical discovery phase activity. This information helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with a typical attack lifecycle:
     - **Initial Compromise:** The malware is installed and communicates with the C&C server.
     - **Establishment of C2:** The malware uses encryption to secure its communication.
     - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information to understand the environment.
   - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C&C server and is using encryption, it is highly likely that the next step would be to gather system information to aid in further exploitation.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
