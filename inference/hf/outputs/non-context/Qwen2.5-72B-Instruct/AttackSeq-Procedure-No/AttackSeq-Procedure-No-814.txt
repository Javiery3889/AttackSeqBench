### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an infected PC has been discovered, and the network configuration has been encrypted using AES.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WinDealer will prompt the user for their credentials as part of the data collection process.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that WinDealer, after encrypting the network configuration, will ask the user for their credentials.
     - This is unusual because typically, malware like WinDealer would attempt to gather credentials stealthily without user interaction to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that WinDealer does not prompt the user for their credentials as part of the data collection process.
     - This is more plausible because malware often uses techniques to gather credentials without user interaction, such as keylogging, credential dumping, or exploiting vulnerabilities.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Malware like WinDealer is designed to operate covertly to avoid detection and maintain access to the infected system.
   - Prompting the user for credentials would likely alert the user to the presence of the malware, which is counterproductive to the malware's goals.
   - Therefore, it is more likely that WinDealer would use stealthier methods to collect credentials rather than prompting the user directly.

### Final Answer: B: No
