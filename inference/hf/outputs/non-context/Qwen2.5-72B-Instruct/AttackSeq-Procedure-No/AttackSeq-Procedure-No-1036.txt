### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Mimikatz for credential theft.
     - Accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
     - Deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file.
   - The question then asks whether APT10 is more likely to use remote COM execution to deliver Beacon payloads for lateral movement or to log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Remote COM Execution:**
     - Remote COM (Component Object Model) execution is a technique used to execute code on a remote system. It can be used for lateral movement, but it is less common and more complex compared to other methods.
     - APT10 is known for using a variety of techniques for lateral movement, including the use of legitimate credentials and remote access tools.
   - **Logging in via Citrix Servers:**
     - APT10 has been known to use valid user credentials to log into networks via remote access tools like Citrix servers.
     - This method is more stealthy and aligns with their known TTPs, as it mimics legitimate user behavior and can help avoid detection.
     - The mention of logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours suggests that APT10 is trying to blend in with normal user activity, which is a common tactic to avoid detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10 is known for using a combination of sophisticated and stealthy techniques to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network.
   - Given that they have already stolen credentials using Mimikatz and have access to the Active Directory domain controller, it is more likely that they would use these credentials to log into the network via Citrix servers.
   - This method is more aligned with their known TTPs and helps them blend in with normal user activity, reducing the risk of detection.
   - Remote COM execution, while possible, is less common and more likely to be detected, making it a less plausible choice for APT10 in this scenario.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
