### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving GreyEnergy, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using spearphishing emails to gain initial access.
     - Compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access.
     - Injecting shellcode into `svchost.exe`.
     - Running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spearphishing Emails:**
     - Spearphishing is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including GreyEnergy. It involves sending targeted emails to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or attachments.
   - **Compromising Public-Facing Web Servers:**
     - Compromising public-facing web servers is another common initial access technique. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications or using stolen credentials.
   - **Injecting Shellcode into `svchost.exe`:**
     - Injecting shellcode into legitimate processes like `svchost.exe` is a technique used to execute malicious code while evading detection. This is a common tactic in the exploitation and post-exploitation phases.
   - **Running Modules Fileless in Memory:**
     - Running modules fileless in memory is a technique to avoid leaving traces on the disk, making it harder for security tools to detect the malware. This is a common tactic used to hinder analysis and detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - GreyEnergy is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the known TTPs of GreyEnergy, which include:
     - Using spearphishing and web server compromises for initial access.
     - Employing process injection and fileless techniques to run malicious code in memory.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
