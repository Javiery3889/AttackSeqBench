### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RIG Exploit Kit (EK).
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Exploit Server:** RIG EK's exploit server returns encrypted exploit code.
     - **Encryption Algorithm:** The exploit code is encrypted using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.
     - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:** The C2 operations use an encrypted channel.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that proxy servers will be used within the infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using proxy servers can indeed make infections harder to detect. Proxy servers can:
       - Mask the true origin of the C2 traffic.
       - Bypass certain network security measures.
       - Add an additional layer of obfuscation to the communication.
     - Given that the RIG EK already uses encryption for its C2 operations, adding proxy servers would be a logical step to further enhance the stealth of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that proxy servers are not likely to be used.
     - However, this seems less plausible given the sophisticated nature of the RIG EK and its use of encryption. Advanced threat actors often employ multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion techniques.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the use of proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
