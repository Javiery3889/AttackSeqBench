### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Utilizing the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
     - Using Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control (C2) channel.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RPC Protocol:**
     - RPC is a protocol that allows a program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction.
     - RPC is often used for communication between different parts of a distributed system, but it is not typically used for data exfiltration.

   - **Microsoft OneDrive as C2:**
     - OneDrive is a cloud storage service that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
     - In the context of C2, OneDrive can be used to send commands to a compromised system and receive data back.
     - OneDrive can be used for data exfiltration, but it is not the most common method for exfiltrating large amounts of data due to its bandwidth and storage limitations.

   - **HTTPS for Data Exfiltration:**
     - HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data.
     - HTTPS is commonly used for data exfiltration because it is widely used, encrypted, and can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
     - Given that the attacker has already used OneDrive for C2, it is plausible that they might use a different, more efficient method for data exfiltration, such as HTTPS.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS. This is because HTTPS is a common and efficient method for data exfiltration, and it complements the use of OneDrive for C2 by providing a different channel for data transfer.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
