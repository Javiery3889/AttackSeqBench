### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
   - They then deliver DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
   - The question asks if it is likely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Malware Delivery:**
     - LYCEUM gains initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - They deliver DanBot malware via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
   - **Clearing System Logs:**
     - Clearing system logs is a technique used to cover tracks and avoid detection. This is typically done after gaining access and establishing a foothold in the system.
   - **Execution of Arbitrary Commands:**
     - DanBot is used to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`, which is a Windows command-line interpreter.
   - **Platform Consideration:**
     - The question mentions clearing Linux or Mac system logs, but the execution of commands is via `cmd.exe`, which is a Windows-specific tool.
     - This suggests that the primary target is a Windows system, not Linux or Mac.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the primary target is a Windows system (as indicated by the use of `cmd.exe`), it is less likely that LYCEUM would focus on clearing Linux or Mac system logs.
   - Clearing system logs on a different platform (Linux or Mac) would not directly benefit the attack on a Windows system.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that LYCEUM would focus on clearing Windows system logs if they were to cover their tracks.

### Final Answer: B: No
