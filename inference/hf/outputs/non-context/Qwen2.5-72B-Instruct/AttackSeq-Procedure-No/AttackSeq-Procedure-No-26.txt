### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware named Machete.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Stealing clipboard contents
     - Capturing screenshots
     - Logging keystrokes
     - Exfiltrating data using SMTPS
     - Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with command and control (C2) servers

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Clipboard Contents, Capturing Screenshots, and Logging Keystrokes:**
     - These are common data collection techniques used by malware to gather sensitive information from the victim's system.
   - **Exfiltrating Data Using SMTPS:**
     - SMTPS (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of SMTP, typically used for sending emails. While it is possible for malware to use SMTPS to exfiltrate data, it is less common compared to other protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
   - **Using FTP and HTTP Ports for Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) are commonly used for data exfiltration and C2 communication. These protocols are more typical in malware operations because they are less likely to be blocked by firewalls and are easier to blend in with normal traffic.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - While it is technically possible for malware to use SMTPS for data exfiltration, it is less common and more likely to raise suspicion. Malware typically uses more common and less detectable methods like HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the malware first exfiltrates data using SMTPS and then uses FTP and HTTP for C2 communication. This sequence is less plausible because it introduces an additional and less common step (SMTPS exfiltration) before using more common methods (FTP and HTTP).

### Final Answer:
B: No
