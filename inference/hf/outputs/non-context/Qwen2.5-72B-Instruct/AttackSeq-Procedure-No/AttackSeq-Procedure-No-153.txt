### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control (C2) infrastructure.
     - Employing tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains for C2:**
     - APT10 is known to use dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Tools like Robocopy and PSCP:**
     - Robocopy is a robust file copying tool used for file transfer and synchronization.
     - PSCP is a command-line secure file copy program, often used for secure file transfers.
   - **Staging Data for Exfiltration:**
     - APT10 has been known to stage data for exfiltration, often using compression tools to reduce the size of the data and make it easier to transfer.
   - **Remote Command Execution Scripts:**
     - APT10 frequently uses remote command execution scripts to automate and control the exfiltration process.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains:**
     - Using dynamic-DNS domains for C2 is a common TTP for APT10, as it allows them to maintain control over compromised systems and evade detection.
   - **Robocopy and PSCP:**
     - These tools are used for file transfer and secure copying, which aligns with the need to move data from the compromised system to the attacker's infrastructure.
   - **Staging Data for Exfiltration:**
     - Staging data in multi-part archives using compression tools is a logical next step after data has been identified and collected. This helps in reducing the size of the data and making it easier to transfer without raising suspicion.
   - **Remote Command Execution Scripts:**
     - Using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools and manage the exfiltration process is a common practice for APT10 to automate and control the exfiltration process.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of TTPs described and the known behavior of APT10, it is highly likely that APT10 will stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
