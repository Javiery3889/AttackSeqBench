### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Stealing clipboard contents
     - Capturing screenshots
     - Logging keystrokes
     - Exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers
     - Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with command and control (C2) servers

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Stealing Clipboard Contents, Capturing Screenshots, and Logging Keystrokes:**
     - These are common data collection techniques used by malware to gather sensitive information from the victim's system.
   - **Exfiltrating Encrypted Data to Remote Servers:**
     - After collecting data, it is common for malware to exfiltrate the data to a remote server. Encrypting the data before exfiltration is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the data remains confidential.
   - **Using FTP and HTTP Ports for Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - FTP and HTTP are common protocols used for communication. However, using these protocols for C2 communication is less common because they are easily detectable and can be blocked by network security measures. More sophisticated malware often uses HTTPS or other encrypted protocols to avoid detection.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the sequence of collecting data and exfiltrating it is plausible, the use of FTP and HTTP for C2 communication is less likely for sophisticated malware like Machete. Machete is known for its advanced capabilities and would likely use more secure and less detectable methods for C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
B: No
