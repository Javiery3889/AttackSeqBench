### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Deployment using PsExec:** This is a common technique for lateral movement and remote execution.
     - **Stopping services and disabling Windows Defender:** This is part of the **Defense Evasion** phase to prevent detection and interference.
     - **Deleting system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands:** This is a technique often used in the **Impact** phase to prevent data recovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Ransomware often aims to prevent victims from recovering their data, and deleting system volume shadow copies is a common technique to achieve this.
       - The use of PowerShell for this task is also common, as PowerShell provides a powerful and flexible scripting environment.
       - Given that the ransomware has already disabled Windows Defender and stopped services, it is logical that it would proceed to delete shadow copies to maximize the impact of the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This choice is less plausible because it contradicts the typical behavior of ransomware, which often includes steps to prevent data recovery.
       - The sequence described in the question already shows a high level of sophistication and intent to cause maximum damage, making it unlikely that the attackers would skip such a crucial step.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the ransomware will indeed delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
