### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sayad malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Gathering information about the compromised host (system details, running processes, data from applications).
     - **Collection Phase:** Setting up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning attack using a Wi-Fi Pineapple to capture victim credentials or plant malware.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Encrypting and uploading the data to a C2 (Command and Control) server at 107.6.182.179 using RSA encryption.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the attacker gathers information about the compromised host to understand its environment and capabilities.
   - **Collection Phase:** Setting up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning attack using a Wi-Fi Pineapple is a technique that can be used to capture victim credentials or plant malware. However, this technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain initial access or to gather more information, rather than after the Discovery phase.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** Encrypting and uploading the data to a C2 server is a common final step in many cyber attacks, where the collected data is sent back to the attacker.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely plausible because the Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning attack is typically used to gain initial access or to gather more information, not as a step in the Collection phase after the Discovery phase.
   - The Discovery phase is usually followed by other techniques such as Lateral Movement, Privilege Escalation, or Persistence, rather than setting up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning attack.
   - The Exfiltration phase (encrypting and uploading data to a C2 server) is a logical final step, but the intermediate step of setting up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning attack does not fit well in the described sequence.

### Final Answer
