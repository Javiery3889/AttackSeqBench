### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack vector: spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - It then asks if APT10 is likely to extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before leveraging shared MSP (Managed Service Provider) infrastructure for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT10 is known to use spear phishing as an initial access vector. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Wi-Fi Network Extraction and Brute-Force Attack:**
     - Extracting Wi-Fi network names and performing brute-force attacks is not a typical TTP for APT10. APT10 is more known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network, rather than focusing on Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:**
     - APT10 has been known to target MSPs and leverage their infrastructure to move laterally between different victim networks. This is a well-documented TTP for APT10.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT10 uses spear phishing to gain initial access, which is consistent with the question.
   - **Wi-Fi Network Extraction and Brute-Force Attack:**
     - This step is less likely. APT10 typically focuses on more sophisticated and targeted methods to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network, rather than brute-forcing Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:**
     - This is a known TTP for APT10. They have been observed targeting MSPs to gain access to multiple victim networks.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible for APT10. While APT10 does use spear phishing and targets MSPs, the step involving Wi-Fi network extraction and brute-force attacks is not a typical part of their TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
