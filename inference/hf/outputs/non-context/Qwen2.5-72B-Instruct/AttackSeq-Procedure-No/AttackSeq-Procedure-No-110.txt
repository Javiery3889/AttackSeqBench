### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already established persistence within a target network.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attacker has established long-term access points within the target network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attacker is moving tools and files to other parts of the network.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** The attacker is using social engineering techniques within the network to gain further access or privileges.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** Once an attacker has established persistence, they have a foothold in the network and can maintain access over time.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Moving tools and files to a network share is a common technique for lateral movement. This allows the attacker to spread their tools and access other parts of the network.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** While internal spearphishing is a technique used to trick internal users into providing access or information, it is not typically the primary method for moving tools laterally. Instead, it is more often used to gain initial access or to escalate privileges.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement via Network Share:** Transferring files to a network share is a plausible and common method for lateral movement. It allows the attacker to distribute tools and malware to other systems within the network.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** While internal spearphishing can be used to gain additional access or information, it is not the primary method for moving tools laterally. The question specifically asks about the likelihood of using network shares for lateral movement, which is a more direct and common approach.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context of the question, it is more likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share rather than through internal spearphishing techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
