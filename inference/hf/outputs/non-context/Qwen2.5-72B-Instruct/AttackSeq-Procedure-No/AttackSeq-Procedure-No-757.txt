### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.
     - Communicating with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4.
     - Performing initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration with Base64 Encoding:**
     - Base64 encoding is a common technique used to obfuscate data before exfiltration. This is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - **Communication via RC4:**
     - RC4 is a stream cipher that has been widely used for encryption. However, it is known to have several vulnerabilities and is generally considered less secure compared to more modern encryption algorithms like AES.
     - While it is possible for an implant to use RC4 for communication, it is less common in modern malware due to its known weaknesses.
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - Gathering system and network information such as network adapter details, computer name, and IP address is a standard initial reconnaissance step in many cyber attacks. This is a plausible and common TTP.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The use of Base64 encoding for data exfiltration and initial reconnaissance are both plausible and common TTPs.
   - However, the use of RC4 for encrypted communication is less common and less secure, especially in modern malware. Most modern malware would use more secure encryption methods like AES.

### Final Answer:
Given the less secure nature of RC4 and its reduced use in modern malware, the sequence described is less likely to be the most plausible.

**Final Answer: B: No**
