### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Office document containing a Flash zero-day exploit is delivered via email.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlackOasis will use AutoIt malware scripts embedded in Microsoft Office documents or malicious links before the Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Email:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Office document delivered via email. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Flash Zero-Day Exploit:**
     - The document contains a Flash zero-day exploit, which is a sophisticated and advanced technique often used by sophisticated threat actors.
   - **ActionScript to Extract the Exploit:**
     - The Flash object within the document uses ActionScript to extract and execute the exploit. This is a specific and technical step in the attack sequence.
   - **AutoIt Malware Scripts or Malicious Links:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that BlackOasis will use AutoIt malware scripts or malicious links before the Flash object uses ActionScript to extract the exploit.
     - AutoIt scripts and malicious links are typically used to deliver or execute malware, but they are not typically used in the same context as a Flash zero-day exploit within a Microsoft Office document.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question is:
       1. Deliver a malicious Microsoft Office document via email.
       2. The document contains a Flash zero-day exploit.
       3. The Flash object uses ActionScript to extract and execute the exploit.
   - **Likelihood of Using AutoIt or Malicious Links:**
     - Given the sophistication of the attack (using a Flash zero-day exploit), it is more likely that the attack would rely on the Flash object and ActionScript to execute the exploit directly.
     - Using AutoIt scripts or malicious links would be an additional step that is not typically necessary or common in such a sophisticated attack.
   - **BlackOasis TTPs:**
     - BlackOasis is known for using sophisticated techniques, including zero-day exploits. The use of a Flash zero-day exploit aligns with their known TTPs.
     - There is no strong evidence or common practice suggesting that BlackOasis would use AutoIt scripts or malicious links in this specific context.
