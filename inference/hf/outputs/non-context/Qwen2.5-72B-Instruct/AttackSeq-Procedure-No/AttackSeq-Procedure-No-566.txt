### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
     2. Compromising a software update as an initial access vector (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers first obtained and used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services, and then used a compromised software update for initial access.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - Attackers often use legitimate credentials to gain initial access to a network or system. This can be achieved through various methods such as phishing, credential stuffing, or social engineering.
       - Once inside the network, they can then move laterally and gain the necessary access to compromise a software update process.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers did not use legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before compromising the software update.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - Without initial access, it would be more difficult for attackers to compromise a software update process. They would need to find another way to gain a foothold in the network, which is often more challenging and less stealthy.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first used legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before compromising the software update.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
