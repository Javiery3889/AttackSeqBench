### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Vyveva's backdoor: obtaining file and directory listings, obtaining the local IP address, retrieving system time and time zone.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate files to the C&C server only before compressing them.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obtaining File and Directory Listings:** This is a common initial step in many malware operations to understand the environment and identify potential targets for exfiltration.
   - **Obtaining the Local IP Address:** This helps the malware understand its network environment and potentially communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Retrieving System Time and Time Zone:** This can be used for various purposes, such as timing operations or avoiding detection during certain hours.
   - **Exfiltration and Compression:**
     - Typically, malware will compress files before exfiltration to reduce the size of the data being sent and to potentially obfuscate the content.
     - Exfiltrating files before compressing them would be less efficient and more likely to raise alerts.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware, it is more plausible that the backdoor would compress files before exfiltrating them to the C&C server. This aligns with best practices for data exfiltration in malware operations.

### Final Answer:
B: No
