### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (CVE-2017-9841):**
     - CVE-2017-9841 is a known vulnerability in PHPUnit that can be exploited to gain initial access to a system. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Leveraging Legitimate Credentials:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for malware to attempt to escalate privileges or move laterally within a network. Leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services is a plausible next step.
   - **Periodic Downloading of a Bash Script:**
     - Maintaining persistence is a critical goal for malware. Periodically downloading a script to ensure the malware remains active is a common technique. The use of a bash script named 'cron' suggests the use of a cron job, which is a common method for maintaining persistence on Unix-like systems.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access.
     2. **Credential Access:** Leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
     3. **Persistence:** Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
   - Each step in this sequence is a well-documented and plausible TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
