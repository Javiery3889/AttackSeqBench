### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that WinDealer might take.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Categorizing collected data into different directories as ".a" files.
     - Discovering data from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications.
     - Reading a configuration file from `C:\ProgramData`.
     - Loading a DLL module into memory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that WinDealer will discover data from SNS applications only before executing the other steps.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible or accurate.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Categorizing Data:**
     - WinDealer is known to categorize collected data into different directories, often using specific file extensions like ".a".
   - **Discovering Data from SNS Applications:**
     - While WinDealer can target various types of data, it is not limited to SNS applications only. It can collect data from a wide range of sources.
   - **Reading Configuration File:**
     - Reading a configuration file from `C:\ProgramData` is a common step in the execution of many malware, including WinDealer, to determine its behavior and targets.
   - **Loading a DLL Module:**
     - Loading a DLL module into memory is a common technique used by malware to execute additional functionality or to evade detection.

4. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests a specific order of operations:
     - Categorizing data.
     - Discovering data from SNS applications.
     - Reading the configuration file.
     - Loading a DLL module.
   - However, the question implies that the discovery of SNS data is a prerequisite for the other steps, which is not necessarily the case. WinDealer can perform these steps in a different order or simultaneously.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the most plausible answer is that the sequence described in the question is not accurate, as WinDealer is not limited to discovering data from SNS applications only before executing the other steps.

Final Answer: B: No
