### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the discovery phase, where attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where attackers gather information about the target environment. This can include network topology, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Tainting Shared Content:** This technique involves modifying or poisoning shared resources (e.g., files, documents, or network shares) to spread malware or gain access to other systems. This can be a method to achieve lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This is the process of moving through a network to access and control additional systems. Tainting shared content can be one way to achieve this.
   - **Installing Persistence Points:** Once an attacker has gained access to a new system, they often install persistence mechanisms to maintain long-term access. This can include creating new user accounts, modifying system configurations, or installing backdoors.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question (discovery -> tainting shared content -> lateral movement -> installing persistence) is a logical and common progression in many cyber attacks.
   - Tainting shared content is a plausible method for achieving lateral movement, and once lateral movement is achieved, installing persistence points on new systems is a typical next step to ensure continued access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression and commonality of this sequence in cyber attacks, the most plausible answer is that attackers are likely to taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
