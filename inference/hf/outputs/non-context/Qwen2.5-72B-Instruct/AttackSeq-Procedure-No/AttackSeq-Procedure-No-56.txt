### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to ensure that web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to them.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned involves:
     - Ensuring web servers are Internet accessible.
     - Copying tools or malware to the web servers.
     - Conducting discovery activities such as system network connections discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If Lazarus ensures that web servers are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware, it suggests a strategic approach to ensure that the tools or malware can be effectively deployed and controlled from the Internet.
     - This would be a logical step to ensure that the group can maintain control and access to the compromised web servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If Lazarus does not ensure that web servers are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware, it implies that the group might rely on other methods to deploy and control the tools or malware.
     - This could be less efficient and might limit the group's ability to interact with the compromised web servers.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Lazarus is known for its sophisticated and strategic approach to cyber attacks.
   - Ensuring that web servers are Internet accessible before deploying tools or malware would provide the group with better control and the ability to conduct further activities, such as discovery, more effectively.
   - It is a common practice in advanced cyber operations to ensure that compromised systems have the necessary network access to facilitate further actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
