### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Ensuring persistence by copying itself to the System32 directory and creating services initiated at system startup.
     2. Decrypting and saving a spying library to the user's temporary folder.
     3. Loading the library and injecting malicious code into `explorer.exe` during the execution phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Copying itself to the System32 directory and creating services initiated at system startup is a common technique for ensuring persistence. This allows the malware to run automatically when the system starts.
   - **Decryption and Saving:**
     - Decrypting and saving a spying library to the user's temporary folder is a plausible next step. Malware often decrypts and saves additional components to avoid detection and to prepare for further actions.
   - **Loading and Injection:**
     - Loading the library and injecting malicious code into `explorer.exe` is a common technique for executing the payload. `explorer.exe` is a trusted process, and injecting code into it can help the malware avoid detection and maintain a low profile.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and follows a common pattern in malware operations:
     1. **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware runs at startup.
     2. **Decryption and Saving:** Preparing the necessary components for execution.
     3. **Loading and Injection:** Executing the payload in a trusted process to avoid detection.
   - The question asks if the malware is likely to decrypt and save the spying library to the user's temporary folder only after loading it as a library and injecting malicious code into `explorer.exe` during the execution phase.
   - This sequence is plausible because:
     - The malware needs to ensure persistence first to guarantee it can run again after a system reboot.
     - Decrypting and saving the library to a temporary folder is a preparatory step for the execution phase.
     - Loading the library and injecting code into `explorer.exe` is the final step to execute the payload.
