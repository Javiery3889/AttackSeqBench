### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers are using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
   - The question then asks whether it is more likely that the attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin or verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Plugin:**
     - A keylogger plugin is a tool that records keystrokes made by the user. This method is effective for capturing passwords and other sensitive information as the user types them.
     - However, keyloggers are typically used in more persistent and long-term attacks, and they may not be as effective in a phishing scenario where the goal is to quickly gather credentials and use them before the victim realizes the compromise.
   - **Real-Time Verification and 2-Step Verification Code:**
     - In a phishing attack, attackers often aim to capture credentials and immediately use them to access the account. This is particularly important when dealing with accounts that have 2-step verification (2FA) enabled.
     - By verifying the credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code, attackers can quickly gain access to the account before the victim has a chance to notice the phishing attempt and take action.
     - This method is more immediate and aligns better with the goal of a phishing attack, which is to quickly and efficiently compromise the account.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context of a phishing attack and the need for quick access to the account, it is more likely that the attackers will verify the victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code rather than using a keylogger plugin.

**Final Answer: B: No**
