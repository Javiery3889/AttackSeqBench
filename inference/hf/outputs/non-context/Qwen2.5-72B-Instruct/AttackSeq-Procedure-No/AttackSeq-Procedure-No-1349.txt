### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the callCam app.
   - The sequence involves the Discovery phase, Exfiltration phase, and Collection phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The collected data is sent to the C&C (Command and Control) server using a customized encoding routine.
   - **Collection Phase:** The data is encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a logical first step where the app gathers information from the compromised device.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** After collecting the data, it is logical to send it to the C&C server. The use of a customized encoding routine is a common technique to obfuscate the data and avoid detection.
   - **Collection Phase:** The question states that the data is encrypted using RSA and AES during the Collection phase. However, the Collection phase typically involves gathering the data, not encrypting it. Encryption is more commonly associated with the Exfiltration phase to protect the data in transit.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely logical because the Collection phase is typically for gathering data, not encrypting it. Encryption is more likely to occur during the Exfiltration phase to protect the data as it is transmitted to the C&C server.
   - Therefore, the sequence as described is not plausible.
