### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Poison Ivy server is delivered via social engineering methods.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware (Poison Ivy server) is delivered via social engineering methods.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed on the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The question focuses on the C2 phase and whether Google Drive is likely to be used.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Poison Ivy is a well-known Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that typically uses direct network connections for C2 communications.
     - While it is possible for malware to use cloud services like Google Drive for C2, it is not a common or typical behavior for Poison Ivy.
     - Using Google Drive for C2 would require additional configuration and might be less stealthy compared to direct network connections.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - Poison Ivy is known for using direct network connections (e.g., TCP/UDP) for C2 communications.
     - The use of Google Drive for C2 is not a standard or typical behavior for Poison Ivy.
     - Poison Ivy is designed to establish a direct connection to the attacker's server, which is more efficient and less likely to be detected by network monitoring tools.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of Poison Ivy and the common practices in C2 communications, it is less likely that Poison Ivy would use Google Drive for C2.

### Final Answer: B: No
