### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a suspicious email containing a Word document with a macro dropper.
   - The macro dropper is designed to execute a JavaScript payload.
   - The final step involves the JavaScript downloader dropping a file from a specified URL and executing it in the system's temporary directory.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attacker used obfuscation techniques to hinder the analysis process only after the final JavaScript downloader dropped and executed the file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation Techniques:**
     - Obfuscation is a common technique used by attackers to make their code and payloads harder to analyze and detect.
     - Obfuscation can be applied at various stages of an attack, including the initial stages (e.g., in the macro dropper or the JavaScript payload) and the final stages (e.g., in the dropped file).
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves multiple stages:
       1. **Initial Infection Vector:** Suspicious email with a Word document containing a macro dropper.
       2. **Execution of JavaScript Payload:** The macro dropper executes a JavaScript payload.
       3. **File Download and Execution:** The JavaScript payload downloads a file from a specified URL and executes it in the system's temporary directory.
   - **Timing of Obfuscation:**
     - The question specifically asks if obfuscation was used only after the final JavaScript downloader dropped and executed the file.
     - This is unlikely because obfuscation is typically used to protect the entire attack chain, not just the final stage.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that obfuscation is commonly used throughout the attack chain to protect the initial infection vector, the JavaScript payload, and the final file, it is unlikely that the attacker would use obfuscation only after the final file is dropped and executed.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attacker used obfuscation techniques at multiple stages, not just after the final file was dropped and executed.

**Final Answer: B: No**
