### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The Flash file 'show.swf' is mentioned as part of the attack.
   - The question asks whether the Flash file will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious Flash file ('show.swf'). This file exploits CVE-2015-5119 to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Exploitation and Shellcode Execution:** Once the Flash file is opened, it exploits the vulnerability to execute shellcode. The shellcode is typically used to perform various actions, including Defense Evasion and payload installation.
   - **Defense Evasion and Payload Installation:** The question specifically asks about the sequence of these actions. In most attack scenarios, the shellcode is designed to perform Defense Evasion techniques (such as process injection, code obfuscation, etc.) to avoid detection before or during the installation of the payload. This is because the attacker wants to ensure that the payload can be installed and executed without being detected by security mechanisms.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** It is more common for the shellcode to perform Defense Evasion techniques first to create a safe environment for the payload installation. Only after ensuring that the environment is secure and the security mechanisms are bypassed, the shellcode will proceed to install the payload.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing email with the malicious Flash file is opened by the victim.
   - **Exploitation:** The Flash file exploits CVE-2015-5119 to execute shellcode.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The shellcode performs Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Payload Installation:** After ensuring the environment is secure, the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

### Final Answer
Given the typical sequence of actions in such attacks, it is more likely that the shellcode will perform Defense Evasion techniques before installing the payload. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
