### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections for lateral movement.
     - Exfiltrating collected data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool.
     - Archiving the data using utilities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group is likely to exfiltrate data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it.
     - This aligns with the known TTPs of the Lazarus group, which often involves sophisticated exfiltration techniques and the use of custom tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group is not likely to exfiltrate data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it.
     - This does not align with the known sophisticated and methodical approach of the Lazarus group.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Lazarus group is known for its advanced and sophisticated attack techniques.
   - They often use custom tools and covert channels to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the described sequence.
   - The use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement is a common initial step in their attack chain.
   - Exfiltrating data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool is a plausible next step, given their known methods.
   - Archiving the data using utilities is a logical final step to ensure the data is compact and easier to transfer.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
