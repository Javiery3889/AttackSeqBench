### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by a threat actor known as Dropping Elephant.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.
     2. Scanning specific lists of target IP addresses.
     3. Executing UPX-packed backdoors.
     4. Downloading additional malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       1. **Gathering Victim Identity Information:**
          - This is a common initial step in targeted attacks, especially for state-sponsored actors like Dropping Elephant, which often focus on gathering intelligence.
       2. **Scanning Specific Lists of Target IP Addresses:**
          - After gathering victim identity information, it is logical for the attacker to scan specific IP addresses to identify potential entry points or to validate the targets.
       3. **Executing UPX-Packed Backdoors:**
          - UPX is a popular packer used to obfuscate malware, making it harder to detect. Executing UPX-packed backdoors is a common technique to establish a foothold in the target network.
       4. **Downloading Additional Malware:**
          - Once a backdoor is established, the attacker can use it to download additional malware to further compromise the system or exfiltrate data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - If we consider the logical flow of a targeted attack, the sequence described in the question aligns well with known TTPs of advanced threat actors.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is highly plausible for a sophisticated threat actor like Dropping Elephant. Each step in the sequence follows a logical progression:
     1. **Gathering Victim Identity Information:** This is a crucial first step for targeted attacks.
     2. **Scanning Specific Lists of Target IP Addresses:** This step helps the attacker validate and identify specific targets.
     3. **Executing UPX-Packed Backdoors:** This is a common technique to establish a foothold in the target network.
     4. **Downloading Additional Malware:** This is a natural next step to further compromise the system.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
