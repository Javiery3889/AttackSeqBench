### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor BlueBravo.
   - The sequence starts with establishing persistence by creating registry run keys to execute malware during system startup.
   - The question then asks if BlueBravo is likely to use network sniffing techniques, specifically deploying Responder to conduct NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) poisoning, to gather victim system information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Creating registry run keys is a common technique for establishing persistence. This ensures that the malware is executed every time the system starts, allowing the threat actor to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Network Sniffing and NBNS Poisoning:**
     - Network sniffing involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to gather information. NBNS poisoning is a specific technique where an attacker responds to NBNS queries with their own IP address, redirecting traffic to the attacker's machine.
     - This technique can be used to gather information about the victim's network, such as usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - After establishing persistence, it is logical for an attacker to gather more information about the victim's system and network. Network sniffing and NBNS poisoning are effective methods for this purpose.
     - BlueBravo, as a sophisticated threat actor, would likely use a combination of techniques to maximize their information gathering and maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression from establishing persistence to gathering more information about the victim's system and network, it is plausible that BlueBravo would use network sniffing techniques, including NBNS poisoning, to gather victim system information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
