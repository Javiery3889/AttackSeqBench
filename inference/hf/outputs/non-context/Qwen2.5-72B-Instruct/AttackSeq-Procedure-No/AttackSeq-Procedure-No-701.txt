### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spear-phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers (Moafee and DragonOK) will use custom-built backdoors and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector. This part of the sequence is plausible.
   - **Environment-Based Evasion Techniques:**
     - Environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, are used to ensure that the payload is executed in a safe environment (e.g., not in a sandbox or virtual machine). This is a common step in the attack lifecycle to avoid detection.
   - **Custom-Built Backdoors and RATs:**
     - Custom-built backdoors and RATs are often used during the resource development phase to maintain persistence and gain remote access to the compromised system. This is a logical next step after ensuring the environment is safe.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression: initial access via spear-phishing, followed by environment-based evasion, and then the deployment of custom-built backdoors and RATs. This sequence aligns with common attack patterns.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a well-known method for gaining initial access to a target system.
   - **Environment-Based Evasion:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, attackers often use environment-based evasion techniques to ensure that their payloads are not detected by security systems. This includes checks for the number of CPU cores, presence of virtualization, and other indicators that might suggest a sandbox or analysis environment.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - After confirming that the environment is safe, attackers typically deploy custom-built backdoors and RATs to maintain persistent access and control over the compromised system. This allows them to exfiltrate data, execute commands, and perform other malicious activities.
