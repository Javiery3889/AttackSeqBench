### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a malware might use.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Achieving persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
     2. Performing cloud infrastructure discovery by enumerating AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances.
     3. Establishing command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (RunOnce Key):**
     - Creating a RunOnce key in the registry is a common technique for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware runs the next time the system is restarted.
   - **Cloud Infrastructure Discovery:**
     - Enumerating AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, is a technique used to gather information about the cloud environment. This is typically done to understand the environment and potentially to identify additional targets or resources.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Establishment:**
     - Process Hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to establish communication with a C2 server. This is a common method for maintaining control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Persistence (RunOnce Key) → Cloud Infrastructure Discovery → C2 Establishment:**
     - It is logical for malware to first ensure persistence to maintain a foothold in the system.
     - After ensuring persistence, the malware might then gather information about the environment, such as cloud infrastructure, to understand the context and identify potential targets.
     - Finally, establishing C2 communication is a critical step for the attacker to control the malware and execute further commands.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. It follows a logical progression of TTPs that an attacker might use to gain and maintain control over a system.

### Final Answer:
