### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Regin, a sophisticated malware, might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.
   - The question then asks if Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization:**
     - This is a common technique used in the discovery phase to understand the victim's environment. It helps the attacker identify running processes, memory usage, and other system details.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:**
     - This is also a discovery technique, often used to find sensitive information that might have been deleted but is still recoverable.
   - **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on E-mail Accounts:**
     - This technique is more commonly associated with the collection phase, where the attacker aims to gather data from the victim's environment. Setting auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts is a way to exfiltrate data without the victim's knowledge.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Regin is known for its sophisticated and multi-stage attack capabilities. It often uses a combination of techniques to maintain persistence and gather information.
   - The sequence described (gathering information and scanning for deleted files) fits well with the discovery phase.
   - Setting auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts is a logical next step in the collection phase, as it allows the attacker to monitor and exfiltrate sensitive information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Regin and the logical progression from discovery to collection, it is plausible that Regin would set auto-forward rules on the victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
