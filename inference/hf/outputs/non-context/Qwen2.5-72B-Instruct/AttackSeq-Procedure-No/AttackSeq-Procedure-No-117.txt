### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-9841**: This is a known vulnerability in PHPUnit, a popular PHP testing framework. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Tuyul Malware**: Tuyul is a type of malware known for its persistence mechanisms and ability to execute various scripts and commands on victim systems.
   - **Persistence Mechanism**: One common method for maintaining persistence is to use a cron job, which can periodically execute a script. This aligns with the description of downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
   - **Executing Perl Scripts and Shell Commands**: Tuyul malware is known to execute various scripts and commands, including Perl scripts and shell commands, to perform malicious activities.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access**: The exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access is a plausible first step.
   - **Persistence**: Downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence is a common technique used by malware to ensure it remains active on the system.
   - **Execution of Scripts**: Executing Perl scripts and shell commands is a typical behavior of Tuyul malware to carry out its malicious activities.

Given the above reasoning, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.
