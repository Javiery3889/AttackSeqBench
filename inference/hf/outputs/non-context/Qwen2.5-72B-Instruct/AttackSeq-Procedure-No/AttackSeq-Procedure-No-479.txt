### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence involves the Discovery phase, where system information such as usernames, computer names, and file attributes are collected.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will exfiltrate files to their C&C (Command and Control) server before reading the file contents from the compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - In the Discovery phase, the threat actor gathers information about the compromised system to understand its environment. This includes collecting usernames, computer names, and file attributes.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase involves gathering data of interest from the compromised system. This typically includes reading file contents to determine what data is valuable.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The Exfiltration phase involves transferring the collected data to the attacker's C&C server or another external location.

3. **Logical Sequence:**
   - It is more logical for the threat actor to first read the file contents to determine what data is valuable before exfiltrating it. Exfiltrating files without knowing their contents could lead to transferring large amounts of irrelevant data, which is inefficient and increases the risk of detection.
   - Therefore, the typical sequence would be:
     1. **Discovery:** Collect system information.
     2. **Collection:** Read file contents to identify valuable data.
     3. **Exfiltration:** Transfer the valuable data to the C&C server.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This suggests that exfiltration happens before reading file contents, which is less likely and less efficient.
   - **B: No** - This suggests that exfiltration does not happen before reading file contents, which aligns with the logical sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
