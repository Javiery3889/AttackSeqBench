### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Misconfigured Docker API:**
     - This is a common initial access technique where attackers take advantage of misconfigurations to gain entry into a system.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance is a phase where attackers gather information about the target to plan their attack.
   - **Supply Chain Relationships:**
     - Gathering detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships is a specific and advanced form of reconnaissance.
   - **Deploying Malicious Containers:**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers might deploy malicious containers to further their objectives.

3. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**
   - **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
     - Once attackers have gained initial access through the misconfigured Docker API, they are likely to perform some form of reconnaissance to understand the environment better.
   - **Supply Chain Reconnaissance:**
     - While gathering detailed knowledge of supply chain relationships is a sophisticated and time-consuming task, it is not typically a necessary step for deploying malicious containers.
     - Deploying malicious containers can often be done with a more general understanding of the environment, such as identifying vulnerable services or misconfigurations.
   - **Context and Motivation:**
     - If the attackers' primary goal is to deploy malicious containers, they are more likely to focus on understanding the internal network and system configurations rather than the broader supply chain relationships.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through misconfigured Docker API ports, attackers are more likely to focus on internal reconnaissance and deploying malicious containers rather than gathering detailed knowledge of the organization's supply chain relationships.
