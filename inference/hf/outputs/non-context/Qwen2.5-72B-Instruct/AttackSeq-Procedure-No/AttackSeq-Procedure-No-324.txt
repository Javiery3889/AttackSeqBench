### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware collects information (text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data) during the Discovery phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control (C2) phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase involves the malware gathering information about the environment it is in, such as system configurations, network topology, and user data. This aligns with the collection of text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The C2 phase involves the malware communicating with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This phase is typically used for maintaining control over the compromised system and for data exfiltration.
   - **FTP Download:**
     - Initiating a download via FTP is more commonly associated with the Initial Access or Execution phases, where the malware might download additional payloads or tools. It is less common for the C2 phase to involve downloading files via FTP, as the primary focus is on communication and data exfiltration.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While the malware might use FTP for data exfiltration, the question specifically asks about initiating a download via FTP during the C2 phase. This is less likely because the C2 phase is more focused on maintaining control and exfiltrating data, not downloading additional files.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely for the malware to initiate a download via FTP during the C2 phase.

### Final Answer: B: No
