### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
     - Retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module.
     - Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials:**
     - This is a common technique used by APT groups to escalate privileges and gain access to sensitive information.
   - **Retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module:**
     - This step involves accessing cloud-based secrets, which is not a typical next step after gaining domain administrator credentials. APT15 is known for targeting on-premises infrastructure and using tools like Mimikatz to move laterally within a network.
   - **Deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS:**
     - Deploying backdoors is a common next step after gaining elevated privileges to maintain persistence and ensure continued access to the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - APT15 is known for its focus on compromising on-premises infrastructure and using tools like Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials. Once they have these credentials, they typically deploy backdoors to maintain persistence.
   - Accessing cloud-based secrets via the AWS Secrets Manager is not a typical step in their attack sequence. It is more likely that they would focus on maintaining control over the compromised network and using the credentials to move laterally and deploy backdoors.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question, which includes retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager, is less plausible compared to the more common sequence of deploying backdoors after gaining domain administrator credentials.

### Final Answer: B: No
