### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Charming Kitten.
   - The sequence starts with the Resource Development phase, where Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Charming Kitten created fake websites to obtain credentials. This is a common technique used to gather initial access credentials, which can be used in subsequent phases of the attack.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The Reconnaissance phase involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This can include collecting e-mail addresses, identifying key personnel, and understanding the target's infrastructure.
     - Gathering e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms is a typical activity during the Reconnaissance phase. This information can be used to tailor phishing attacks or to identify potential targets for credential harvesting.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - It is logical that Charming Kitten would gather e-mail addresses during the Reconnaissance phase to identify potential targets for their credential harvesting efforts.
   - The use of fake websites to obtain credentials (Resource Development) is often preceded by or accompanied by Reconnaissance activities to gather the necessary information to make the fake websites more convincing and to identify the most valuable targets.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
