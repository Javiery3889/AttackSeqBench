### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor named Smooth Operator.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file during the discovery phase.
     2. Accessing and downloading information stored in SharePoint instances.
     3. Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Smooth Operator is not likely to access and download information from SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Collecting the OS version from the `SystemVersion.plist` file is a common discovery technique used to gather information about the target system.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Accessing and downloading information from SharePoint instances is a data exfiltration technique. This is a logical next step after discovery, as the attacker would want to gather sensitive information from the target environment.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Performing HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers is a common technique used to send stolen data back to the attacker or to receive further commands.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The sequence described in the question (discovery, data exfiltration, C2 communication) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks. It follows the typical attack lifecycle where the attacker first gathers information, then exfiltrates data, and finally communicates with the C2 server.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical attack lifecycle, it is plausible that Smooth Operator would access and download information from SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
