### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Black Energy 2 performing a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath.
     - Enabling subsequent operation in memory.
     - Removing on-disk artifacts.
     - Evading defenses by encrypting its payload.
     - Loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Black Energy 2 Overview:**
     - Black Energy 2 is a well-known malware family that has been used in various cyber attacks, particularly in targeted attacks against critical infrastructure.
     - It is known for its modular architecture, which allows it to load additional plugins and components to extend its functionality.
     - Black Energy 2 often uses techniques to evade detection, such as encrypting its payload and removing on-disk artifacts to avoid leaving traces.

   - **TTPs Analysis:**
     - **Mounting and Binding to `/proc/` Filepath:**
       - The `/proc/` directory in Unix-like systems is a pseudo-filesystem that provides an interface to kernel data structures. Malware might use this to manipulate or hide its processes, but it is not a common technique for Black Energy 2.
     - **Enabling Subsequent Operation in Memory:**
       - Black Energy 2 is known to operate in memory to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
     - **Removing On-Disk Artifacts:**
       - This is a common technique used by malware to avoid detection and forensic analysis.
     - **Evading Defenses by Encrypting Its Payload:**
       - Encrypting the payload is a common technique to evade signature-based detection.
     - **Loading Plugins Directly onto the Infected Machine:**
       - Black Energy 2 is modular and can load additional plugins to extend its capabilities.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While Black Energy 2 is known for operating in memory, removing on-disk artifacts, encrypting its payload, and loading plugins, the specific technique of mounting and binding to the `/proc/` filepath is not a typical behavior for this malware.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is not the most plausible for Black Energy 2.

### Final Answer: B: No
