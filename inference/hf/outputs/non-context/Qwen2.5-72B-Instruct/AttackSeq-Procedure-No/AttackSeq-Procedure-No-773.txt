### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a malicious website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com).
   - The next step in the sequence is the installation and execution of a Remote Access Tool (RAT) named 'IvizTech' as a service to maintain persistence.
   - Finally, the question asks if it is likely that the RAT is installed and executed as a service before a malware downloader executes binaries.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access is achieved through social engineering (tricking users into downloading a fake app). This is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by attackers to gain a foothold in a target system.
   - **Persistence:** Installing a RAT as a service is a common method to maintain persistence. This ensures that the attacker can maintain access to the system even if the user reboots the machine.
   - **Malware Downloader:** A malware downloader is typically used to download and execute additional malicious payloads. This is often done after the initial access and persistence have been established.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker tricks users into downloading a fake app.
     2. **Persistence:** The attacker installs and executes a RAT as a service to maintain access.
     3. **Malware Downloader:** The attacker uses a malware downloader to execute additional binaries.
   - It is highly likely that the attacker would want to ensure persistence before executing additional malware to avoid losing access to the compromised system.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
