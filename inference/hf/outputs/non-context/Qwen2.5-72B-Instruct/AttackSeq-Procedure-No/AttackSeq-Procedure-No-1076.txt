### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tropic Trooper initially exploited either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802:**
     - These are both vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. They are typically used to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Spearphishing via Social Media:**
     - Spearphishing is a common technique used to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading malware. However, it is usually used as an initial access vector itself, not after gaining initial access through a vulnerability.
   - **System Configuration File and Backdoor Installer:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use various techniques to maintain persistence and deploy additional malware, such as dropping a backdoor installer.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that Tropic Trooper first exploited a vulnerability to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, it is less likely that the attackers would then use social media to spearphish victims, as they already have a foothold in the system.
   - Instead, it is more plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would directly proceed to drop a backdoor installer to maintain persistence and further their attack.
