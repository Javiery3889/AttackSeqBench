### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Sednit group.
   - The sequence starts with gaining execution through a Delphi downloader.
   - The Delphi downloader uses Windows API to execute commands and sends gathered system information to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - The question then asks if the subsequent AutoIt downloader will perform system service discovery to obtain information about services on the victim's machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Delphi Downloader:**
     - Gains execution.
     - Uses Windows API to execute commands.
     - Sends system information to the C&C server.
   - **AutoIt Downloader:**
     - The question asks if this downloader will perform system service discovery.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **System Service Discovery:**
     - System service discovery is a common technique used by malware to gather information about the victim's machine. This information can be used to understand the environment, identify potential targets, and plan further actions.
   - **Sednit Group's TTPs:**
     - The Sednit group is known for using multiple stages of downloaders and loaders to achieve their objectives. Each stage often has a specific role, such as initial execution, command execution, and information gathering.
     - Given that the Delphi downloader has already gathered and sent system information, it is plausible that the next stage (AutoIt downloader) would continue the information gathering process, including system service discovery.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the common TTPs of the Sednit group and the logical progression of the attack sequence, it is reasonable to assume that the AutoIt downloader would perform system service discovery to obtain more detailed information about the victim's machine.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
