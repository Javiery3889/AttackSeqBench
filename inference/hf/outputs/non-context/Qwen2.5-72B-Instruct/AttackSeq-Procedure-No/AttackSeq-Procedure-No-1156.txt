### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing for Credentials:**
     - Phishing is a common technique used to steal credentials. Once the attackers have the credentials, they can log into the victim's Instagram account.
   - **Stopping Backup Services:**
     - Stopping backup services is typically a tactic used to prevent the victim from restoring their data or account. However, Instagram does not provide a user-accessible backup service for individual accounts. The primary concern for attackers would be to maintain control over the account.
   - **Locking Out the Original Owners:**
     - Changing the password is a straightforward and effective way to lock out the original owners. This is a common final step in account takeover attacks.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Stopping Backup Services:**
     - Given that Instagram does not offer a user-accessible backup service, it is unlikely that attackers would need to stop any backup services to maintain control over the account.
   - **Changing Passwords:**
     - Changing the password is a critical step in ensuring that the original owner cannot regain access to the account. This is a common and logical step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The most plausible sequence of TTPs in this scenario is that the attackers will collect the credentials through phishing and then change the password to lock out the original owners, without the need to stop any backup services.
