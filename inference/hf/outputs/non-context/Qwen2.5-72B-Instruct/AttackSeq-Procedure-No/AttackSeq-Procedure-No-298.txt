### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aurora malware.
   - The TTPs include:
     - Modifying the file-time of a dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
     - Loading the DLL into its own `svchost.exe` process to evade detection.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 (Command and Control).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **File-Time Modification:** This is a common technique used to evade detection by making the malicious file appear as a legitimate system file. This is often part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
     - **Loading into `svchost.exe`:** This is another evasion technique where the malware injects itself into a legitimate system process to hide its presence. This is also part of the **Defense Evasion** and **Execution** tactics.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The question specifically asks about the use of the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 communication.
     - Jabber/XMPP is a protocol used for instant messaging and presence information. While it can be used for C2, it is not a common choice for malware C2 communication, especially for sophisticated malware like Aurora.
     - Aurora malware, which is known for its targeted and sophisticated attacks, typically uses more stealthy and less traceable methods for C2 communication, such as HTTPS or custom protocols.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Aurora malware and the less common use of Jabber/XMPP for C2 communication, it is unlikely that Aurora would use this protocol for C2.

**Final Answer: B: No**
