### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The first TTP mentioned is "keylogging for Collection using libCache32.exe."
   - The second TTP mentioned is "extracting Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using libchrome.exe."

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging for Collection:**
     - Keylogging is a common technique used to capture keystrokes, which can include sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other credentials.
     - The use of `libCache32.exe` for keylogging is plausible, as it is a known tool used in various malware and spyware for this purpose.
   - **Extracting Chrome Passwords for Credential Access:**
     - Google Chrome stores user passwords in SQLite databases.
     - Extracting these passwords involves querying the SQLite databases, which can be done using a tool like `libchrome.exe`.
     - This is a common technique used by malware and spyware to gain access to stored credentials.

3. **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     - **Collection (Keylogging):** The attacker first captures keystrokes to gather initial information.
     - **Credential Access (Extracting Chrome Passwords):** The attacker then uses the gathered information to access more sensitive data, such as stored passwords in Chrome.
   - Both steps are consistent with the goals of a spyware or malware attack, where the initial data collection is followed by more targeted credential access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
