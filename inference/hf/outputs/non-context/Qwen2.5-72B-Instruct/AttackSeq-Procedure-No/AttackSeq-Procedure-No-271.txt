### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Mustang Panda's Korplug variant.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Data Exfiltration over TCP:** Using a custom protocol for data exfiltration involving compressed and encrypted messages.
     - **Data Discovery:** Collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration over TCP:**
     - This technique is typically used to send data out of the compromised network. It often follows the collection and preparation of data for exfiltration.
   - **Data Discovery:**
     - This technique involves identifying and collecting data from the compromised system. It is a prerequisite for data exfiltration because the attacker needs to know what data to exfiltrate.

3. **Logical Sequence:**
   - In a typical attack sequence, data discovery usually occurs before data exfiltration. The attacker first needs to find and collect the data they want to exfiltrate.
   - Given that the question states that the Korplug variant is already using a custom protocol for data exfiltration, it is highly likely that the data discovery phase has already been completed or is ongoing.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since data discovery is a necessary step before data exfiltration, it is logical to assume that the Korplug variant has already performed or is performing data discovery, including collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
