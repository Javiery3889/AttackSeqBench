### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access phase where emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT are sent.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT.
   - **Resource Development:** The question asks about the use of custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during this phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The use of emails with diplomatic themes and a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT is a common tactic for initial access. This is often used to trick victims into clicking on the link, which can lead to the download of malware or the execution of a payload.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The Resource Development phase is typically focused on gathering information and resources to support the adversary's objectives. This can include setting up infrastructure, gathering intelligence, and preparing for further stages of the attack.
     - Custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor are more likely to be used in later stages of the attack, such as Command and Control (C2) or Exfiltration, rather than during the Resource Development phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the initial access phase is well-defined and plausible, the use of custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor during the Resource Development phase is less likely. These tools are typically used for maintaining persistence, establishing C2, and exfiltrating data, which are activities that occur after the initial access and resource development phases.

### Final Answer: B: No
