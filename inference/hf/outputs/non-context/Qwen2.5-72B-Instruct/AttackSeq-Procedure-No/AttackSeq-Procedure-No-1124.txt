### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a malicious Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) to gain initial access.
   - The Flash file 'show.swf' is mentioned, and the question asks if it is likely that this file will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Exploit:**
     - The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Flash file ('show.swf') that exploits CVE-2015-5119. This is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash that can be used to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
   - **Downgrading NTLM:**
     - Downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes is a technique used to force a system to use a less secure authentication protocol, making it easier to capture and crack the hashes. This is typically done to gain additional credentials for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the Flash file first downgrades NTLM to capture hashes before the shellcode installs the payload.
     - However, in a typical attack sequence, the initial exploit (in this case, the Flash file) would first gain a foothold on the system by executing the shellcode. Once the shellcode is executed, it can then perform additional actions, such as downgrading NTLM or installing a payload.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. Typically, the initial exploit (Flash file) would first execute the shellcode to gain a foothold on the system. Only after gaining initial access would the attacker likely attempt to downgrade NTLM to capture hashes or perform other post-exploitation activities.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

### Final Answer: B: No
