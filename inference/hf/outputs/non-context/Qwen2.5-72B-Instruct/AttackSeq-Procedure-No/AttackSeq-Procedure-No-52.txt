### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections for lateral movement.
     - Collecting data from removable media devices.
     - Exfiltrating data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement is a common TTP. WMIC is often used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a typical method for moving laterally within a network.
   - **Data Collection from Removable Media:**
     - Collecting data from removable media devices is a plausible step in the data exfiltration process. However, it is not a common first step after lateral movement. Typically, attackers first gather data from the compromised systems and then decide on the method of exfiltration.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool is a sophisticated method of data exfiltration. This is a common TTP for advanced threat actors like the Lazarus group.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most common or logical sequence of TTPs. Typically, after lateral movement, the attacker would first gather data from the compromised systems, and then decide on the method of exfiltration. Collecting data from removable media devices is a specific and less common step that might not be part of the initial exfiltration plan.

### Final Answer:
B: No
