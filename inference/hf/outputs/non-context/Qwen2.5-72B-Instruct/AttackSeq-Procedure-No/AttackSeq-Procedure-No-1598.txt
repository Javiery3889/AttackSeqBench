### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater uses decoy documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 for Initial Access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that MuddyWater will use asymmetric cryptography such as RSA to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - MuddyWater is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection. Asymmetric cryptography, such as RSA, is a robust method for securing C2 communications. It ensures that even if the traffic is intercepted, it cannot be easily decrypted without the private key.
     - Using RSA for C2 traffic would align with the group's goal of maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - While MuddyWater is known for using sophisticated techniques, the use of asymmetric cryptography like RSA for C2 traffic is not a common practice for all APT groups. Some groups prefer simpler, more lightweight encryption methods to avoid the overhead and complexity of asymmetric cryptography.
     - However, given MuddyWater's known sophistication, it is not entirely unlikely that they would use RSA for C2 traffic.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - MuddyWater is a sophisticated APT group that often employs advanced techniques to maintain stealth and evade detection.
   - Asymmetric cryptography, such as RSA, is a well-established method for securing communications and is often used in C2 traffic to prevent interception and decryption.
   - Given the group's known capabilities and the importance of secure C2 communications, it is plausible that MuddyWater would use RSA for this purpose.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
