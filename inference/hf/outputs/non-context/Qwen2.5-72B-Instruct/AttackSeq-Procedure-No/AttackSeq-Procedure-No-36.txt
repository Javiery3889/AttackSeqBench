### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Enumeration of running processes.
     - Gathering browser data (bookmarks and stored credentials).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will:
     - Deploy a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network.
     - Target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Enumeration of Running Processes:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Gathering Browser Data:**
     - Collecting browser data, including bookmarks and stored credentials, is a typical next step to gather sensitive information.
   - **Deploying a Network Sniffer Module:**
     - Deploying a network sniffer to capture credentials being sent over the network is a logical next step to gather additional credentials that may not be stored locally.
   - **Targeting and Exfiltrating Credentials from Password Stores:**
     - After gathering credentials from the network, targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores (e.g., password managers, keychains) is a common follow-up action to ensure a comprehensive collection of credentials.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     - Initial reconnaissance (enumeration of processes).
     - Data collection (gathering browser data).
     - Expanding the scope of data collection (deploying a network sniffer).
     - Ensuring comprehensive data exfiltration (targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores).
   - This sequence aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like Machete, which aims to maximize the amount of sensitive information it can collect.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
