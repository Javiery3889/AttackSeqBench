### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during the discovery phase.
     - Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement.
     - Deploying AvosLocker and other tools across the network.
     - Collecting data from network shared drives.
     - Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Leveraging Native OS Binaries and Custom Malware for Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - This is a common technique used in the discovery phase to gather information about the network and systems. It aligns with the initial steps of many cyber attacks.
   - **Using Software Deployment Tools like PDQ Deploy for Lateral Movement:**
     - PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that can be abused by threat actors to move malware and tools across the network. This is a known technique for lateral movement.
   - **Deploying AvosLocker and Other Tools:**
     - AvosLocker is a type of ransomware. Deploying ransomware and other tools is a common next step after gaining a foothold and moving laterally.
   - **Collecting Data from Network Shared Drives:**
     - Once the threat actor has moved laterally and deployed tools, they often collect data from network shared drives to exfiltrate sensitive information.
   - **Targeting Specific Information for Fraudulent Transactions:**
     - After collecting data, the threat actor may target specific information to carry out fraudulent transactions, which is a common end goal of many cyber attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known TTPs of threat actors like FIN13. Each step in the sequence logically follows the previous one, making it a realistic attack scenario.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
