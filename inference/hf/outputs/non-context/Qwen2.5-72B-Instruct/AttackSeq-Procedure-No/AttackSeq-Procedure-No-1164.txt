### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Developing a custom toolset.
     - Registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services.
     - Identifying network topologies.
     - Gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that ProjectM actors identified network topologies before gaining initial access.
     - Identifying network topologies is a reconnaissance activity that typically occurs before gaining initial access. This is because understanding the network structure helps in planning the attack and choosing the most effective methods to gain entry.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that ProjectM actors did not identify network topologies before gaining initial access.
     - This would imply that the actors gained initial access without prior knowledge of the network, which is less likely for a sophisticated attack. Reconnaissance is a crucial step in targeted attacks to ensure the success of the initial access methods.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reconnaissance is a critical phase in the attack lifecycle.**
     - Before launching spear-phishing emails or setting up watering hole attacks, attackers often gather as much information as possible about the target, including network topologies.
     - This information helps in tailoring the attack to be more effective and in choosing the right targets for initial access.
   - **Custom toolset and domain registration are preparatory steps.**
     - These actions are part of the early stages of the attack, but they do not provide the detailed information needed to plan the initial access.
   - **Identifying network topologies is a logical next step.**
     - After setting up the necessary infrastructure (custom toolset and domains), the next logical step is to gather detailed information about the target network to plan the attack effectively.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
