### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group FIN13.
   - The sequence starts with the use of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE suggests that FIN13 has already gained some level of access to the target network. BLUEAGAVE is used to establish a local HTTP server, which is a method for maintaining command and control (C2) and executing commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions that FIN13 uses tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to establish persistence. This indicates that they have already taken steps to ensure they can maintain long-term access to the compromised system.
   - **Exploiting External Servers:**
     - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. However, given that they have already established a foothold and persistence, it is less likely that they would need to exploit external servers for initial access. Instead, they would use the existing access and persistence mechanisms to further their objectives.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** FIN13 uses BLUEAGAVE to establish a local HTTP server, indicating they have already gained initial access.
   - **Step 2:** They use SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to establish persistence, ensuring they can maintain access over time.
   - **Step 3:** Given that they have already achieved initial access and persistence, it is less likely that they would need to exploit external servers for initial access. Instead, they would use the existing access to deploy additional tools or move laterally within the network.
