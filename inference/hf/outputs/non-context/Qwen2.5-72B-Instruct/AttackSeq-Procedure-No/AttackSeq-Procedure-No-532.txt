### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Dropping Elephant backdoor evades defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
   - The question then asks whether this backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victimâ€™s machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal browser cookies.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is not likely to steal browser cookies.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Dropping Elephant Backdoor:**
     - The Dropping Elephant backdoor is known for its capabilities in exfiltrating data and maintaining persistence on compromised systems.
     - It often includes features to steal sensitive information, such as credentials and cookies, to further compromise the victim's environment.
   - **Browser Cookies:**
     - Browser cookies can contain valuable information, such as session tokens, which can be used to maintain unauthorized access to web applications.
     - Stealing browser cookies is a common technique used by malware to gain persistent access to user accounts and sensitive data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the known capabilities of the Dropping Elephant backdoor and the value of browser cookies in maintaining unauthorized access, it is plausible that the backdoor would steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
