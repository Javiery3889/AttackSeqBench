### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.
     2. Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
     3. Using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, often used for reconnaissance and gaining initial access.
   - **Step 2: Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.**
     - The Ghostscript vulnerability is a known issue that can be exploited to gain initial access to a system. HWP files are commonly used in targeted attacks, especially in regions where they are prevalent (e.g., South Korea).
   - **Step 3: Using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.**
     - PostScript and EPS files are used for document formatting and can be used to evade detection by security systems. However, this step is typically used for defense evasion after initial access has been gained, not before.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers are using a multi-step approach:
     1. **Reconnaissance and Initial Contact:** Targeting specific groups with impersonated documents.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Using simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files to avoid detection.
   - The use of EPS files for defense evasion is typically a post-access technique, not a pre-access technique. Therefore, it is unlikely that attackers would use EPS files for defense evasion before gaining initial access through the HWP files.

### Final Answer
