### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access:** Using crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails.
     2. **Discovery:** Probing potential victims' identity information.
     3. **Scanning:** Using geographically distributed scan bots to scan IP ranges and identify vulnerable systems.
     4. **Reporting:** Bots reporting back to a central server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Spear Phishing):** APT28 is known to use spear phishing with crafted documents to gain initial access to a target network. This is a well-documented TTP.
   - **Discovery (Probing Identity Information):** After gaining initial access, APT28 typically performs reconnaissance to gather information about the environment, including identity information. This is a logical next step to understand the network and identify valuable targets.
   - **Scanning (Geographically Distributed Scan Bots):** Scanning IP ranges to identify vulnerable systems is a common technique used by APT groups to expand their foothold within a network. However, the use of geographically distributed scan bots is more sophisticated and typically occurs after the initial discovery phase to avoid detection.
   - **Reporting (Bots to Central Server):** Bots reporting back to a central server is a common method for APT groups to manage and coordinate their activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible but not the most typical or efficient sequence for APT28.
   - APT28 is known to be highly sophisticated and often uses a more streamlined approach:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear phishing with crafted documents.
     2. **Discovery:** Immediate reconnaissance to understand the network and identify key systems.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Using the information gathered to move laterally within the network.
     4. **Scanning and Exploitation:** Scanning for vulnerabilities and exploiting them to gain deeper access.
     5. **Persistence and Data Exfiltration:** Establishing persistence and exfiltrating data.

   - The use of geographically distributed scan bots to scan IP ranges and report back to a central server is a more advanced and less common technique that might be used in specific, highly targeted operations but is not a standard part of APT28's typical attack sequence.
