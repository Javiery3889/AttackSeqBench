### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aurora malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with C&C (Command and Control) servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.
     - Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
     - Loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication with C&C Servers:**
     - Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, which can help the malware blend in with legitimate traffic.
     - Using a weak custom encryption scheme suggests that the malware is trying to hide its communications but may be vulnerable to certain types of analysis.
   - **Modifying File-Time:**
     - Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL is a common technique used to evade detection by security tools and analysts. This makes the malicious file appear as if it was created at the same time as a legitimate system file.
   - **Loading DLL into svchost.exe:**
     - Loading a malicious DLL into a legitimate process like svchost.exe is a technique known as process hollowing or DLL injection. This can help the malware evade detection by running in the context of a trusted process.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with known malware behavior. Each step (communication, file-time modification, and DLL loading) is a plausible and commonly used technique in malware operations.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Aurora malware would follow this sequence to evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
