### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the SLUB malware.
   - The malware is in the Discovery phase, where it collects system information and captures screenshots.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 (Command and Control) server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The malware is collecting system information and capturing screenshots. This is a common technique used by malware to gather information about the compromised system and its environment.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data from the compromised system to an external location, typically a C2 server.
     - It is common for malware to automatically exfiltrate collected data to a C2 server to ensure that the attacker can access and analyze the information.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware is already in the Discovery phase and has collected system information and screenshots, it is highly likely that the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data.
   - Malware often automates the exfiltration process to ensure that the collected data is sent to the attacker without requiring manual intervention.
   - The C2 server is a central point where the attacker can receive and manage the exfiltrated data, making it a common target for exfiltration.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
