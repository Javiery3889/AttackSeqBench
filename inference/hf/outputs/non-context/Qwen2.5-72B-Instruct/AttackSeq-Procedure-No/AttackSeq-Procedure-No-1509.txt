### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Carbanak group using the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials.
   - It specifies that this activity would only occur after compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using those credentials to compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Carbanak group would use the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials only after gaining Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - **Initial Compromise:** The Carbanak group would first need to gain a foothold in the network, which could involve compromising a user's credentials.
       - **Elevation of Privileges:** Once they have initial access, they would likely attempt to escalate their privileges to gain Domain Administrator credentials.
       - **Lateral Movement:** With Domain Administrator credentials, they can move laterally within the network to compromise additional endpoints.
       - **Network Mapping and Credential Collection:** Using tools like Cobalt Strike, they can then map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials to further their objectives.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Carbanak group would not use the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials only after gaining Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
     - This sequence is less plausible because:
       - It implies that the Carbanak group would use Cobalt Strike for network mapping and credential collection without first gaining the necessary high-level credentials, which is less efficient and more likely to be detected.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors like the Carbanak group, the most plausible answer is that they would use the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials only after gaining Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
