### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries acquired domains and tools like Empire only after exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) through spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - Key elements to consider:
     - Acquisition of domains (e.g., wordkeyvpload[.]net)
     - Use of tools like Empire
     - Exploitation of CVE-2021-40444
     - Initial access via spear phishing emails

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Acquisition of Domains and Tools:**
     - Adversaries typically acquire domains and tools like Empire before the attack to prepare for the operation. These are part of the pre-attack phase, where they set up the infrastructure and tools they will use.
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2021-40444:**
     - CVE-2021-40444 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited through spear phishing emails. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a target network.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The typical sequence of events in a cyber attack involving such a vulnerability would be:
       1. **Preparation:** Acquire domains and tools.
       2. **Initial Access:** Use spear phishing emails to exploit the vulnerability and gain access.
       3. **Execution:** Deploy the tools and use the acquired domains to further the attack.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - It is unlikely that adversaries would acquire domains and tools only after gaining initial access. These steps are usually part of the preparation phase, which occurs before the actual exploitation.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not likely that the adversaries acquired domains and tools only after exploiting the vulnerability.

### Final Answer: B: No
