### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves a backdoor program establishing communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server using DNS tunneling.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor program will parse the returned data, extract commands from the C2 server, and then gather host information during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS Tunneling (T1071.004):** This technique involves using the DNS protocol to communicate with a C2 server. DNS tunneling is often used to exfiltrate data or receive commands from the C2 server.
   - **Parsing and Extracting Commands:** After establishing communication, the backdoor program would need to parse the DNS responses to extract the commands sent by the C2 server. This is a logical next step to understand what actions the C2 server is instructing the backdoor to perform.
   - **Gathering Host Information (T1082):** Once the backdoor has received and parsed the commands, it may then proceed to gather host information as part of the discovery phase. This information can include details about the system, network configuration, and other relevant data that can help the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Establish Communication:** The backdoor uses DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server.
     2. **Parse and Extract Commands:** The backdoor parses the DNS responses to extract commands from the C2 server.
     3. **Gather Host Information:** The backdoor then gathers host information as part of the discovery phase, based on the commands received.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
