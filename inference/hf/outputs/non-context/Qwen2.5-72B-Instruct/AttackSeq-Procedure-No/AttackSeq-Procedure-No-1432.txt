### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Smooth Operator malware.
   - The malware establishes communication with its C2 (Command and Control) servers over HTTPS.
   - It uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate its collected data using the MIME protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTPS Communication:**
     - HTTPS is a secure protocol used to encrypt data in transit, making it difficult for eavesdroppers to intercept the communication.
   - **Custom Data Encoding:**
     - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation adds an additional layer of security, making it harder for network security tools to detect the malicious traffic.
   - **MIME Protocol:**
     - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for formatting messages to include non-ASCII characters, attachments, and other content types. It is commonly used in email communication.
   - **Exfiltration over MIME:**
     - While MIME is a standard for email, it is not typically used for exfiltrating data from a compromised system to a C2 server. Malware usually uses protocols that are more stealthy and less likely to be flagged by network security systems.
     - Given that the malware is already using HTTPS and a custom encoding algorithm, it is more likely to continue using these methods for exfiltration rather than switching to MIME, which is more associated with email and less stealthy in a network context.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that the Smooth Operator malware will exfiltrate its collected data using the MIME protocol.

**Final Answer: B: No**
