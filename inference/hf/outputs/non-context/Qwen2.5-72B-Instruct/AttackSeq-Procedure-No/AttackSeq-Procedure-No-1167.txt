### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Spear-phishing campaigns.
     - Hosting watering hole sites to deliver initial payloads.
     - Conducting reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains.
     - Executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains before moving forward with executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
     - This aligns with the typical attack lifecycle, where reconnaissance is often a crucial initial step to gather information about potential targets before launching more sophisticated attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that ProjectM actors conducted such reconnaissance.
     - This would imply that the actors moved directly to spear-phishing and watering hole attacks without prior target identification, which is less common and less effective in targeted attacks.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reconnaissance is a Common Initial Step:**
     - In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, reconnaissance (T1592) is often the first step in a targeted attack. It involves gathering information about the target to plan and execute more effective attacks.
   - **Spear-Phishing and Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - These techniques (T1566 and T1569) are typically used after the attackers have identified and selected their targets.
   - **Execution of Trojans:**
     - Once the initial access is gained through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks, the attackers can then deploy and execute Trojans like Crimson and Peppy (T1204 and T1059).

Given the typical attack lifecycle and the alignment with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is highly likely that ProjectM actors conducted reconnaissance before moving forward with their attacks.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
