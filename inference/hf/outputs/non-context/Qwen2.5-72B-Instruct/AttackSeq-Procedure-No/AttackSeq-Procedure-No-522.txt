### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access via a Microsoft Word document exploiting CVE-2017-0199.
     - Employing a worm infection strategy using a removable device to breach a secure network environment.
     - Achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2017-0199:**
     - CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine by tricking the user into opening a specially crafted Word document. This is a common initial access technique.
   - **Worm Infection Strategy Using a Removable Device:**
     - Worms can spread through removable devices like USB drives. However, this technique is typically used to spread malware within a network or to infect isolated systems. It is less common to use this method after gaining initial access via a vulnerability like CVE-2017-0199.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - Scheduling a task to execute a VBS file is a common persistence technique. The task name 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' is a common name used by attackers to blend in with legitimate system tasks.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial access via CVE-2017-0199 is a plausible and common technique.
   - The use of a worm infection strategy via a removable device is less likely to be part of the same attack sequence, especially after gaining initial access through a vulnerability. Worms are typically used for lateral movement or initial infection in isolated environments.
   - The persistence mechanism (scheduling a task) is a logical next step after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the worm infection strategy using a removable device after initial access via CVE-2017-0199. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
