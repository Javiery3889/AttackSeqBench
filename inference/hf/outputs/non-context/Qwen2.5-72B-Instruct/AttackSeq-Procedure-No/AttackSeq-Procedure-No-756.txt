### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial reconnaissance: Decrypting and collecting network and system information.
     - Communication with C2 (Command and Control) using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - The Rising Sun implant is known for its capability to perform initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information. This is a common TTP for many malware implants to gather information about the compromised system and network.
   - **Communication with C2:**
     - The use of blogs and WordPress for C2 communication is a known technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" tactic. Specifically, this technique is referred to as "Web Protocols" (T1071) and "Web Services" (T1102).
     - Malware often uses legitimate web services to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection. Blogs and WordPress sites can be used to host C2 servers or to exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that the Rising Sun implant is capable of initial reconnaissance and that using blogs and WordPress for C2 communication is a plausible and documented technique, it is reasonable to conclude that the Rising Sun implant could use these methods for bidirectional communication.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
