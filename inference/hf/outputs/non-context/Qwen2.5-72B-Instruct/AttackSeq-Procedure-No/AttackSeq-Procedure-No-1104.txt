### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke targets files on hard drives and network drives for discovery.
     - **Collection:** The question asks if it is likely that the malware captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - CosmicDuke is known for its capability to discover and exfiltrate sensitive information from infected systems. This includes searching for files on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - Capturing credentials from a manipulated login page is a common technique used by malware to gather sensitive information. This is often part of the "Collection" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
     - Ivanti Connect Secure is a remote access and management tool. If CosmicDuke can manipulate the login page of such a tool, it can capture credentials entered by users.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - CosmicDuke is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to manipulate and capture data from various sources.
   - Given that the malware has already targeted files for discovery, it is plausible that it would also attempt to capture credentials from a manipulated login page to further its collection efforts.
   - The manipulation of a login page to capture credentials is a logical next step in the attack sequence, as it allows the attacker to gain additional access and control over the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
