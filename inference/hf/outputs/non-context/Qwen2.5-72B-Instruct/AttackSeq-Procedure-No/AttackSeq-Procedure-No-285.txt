### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Elfin threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltration of data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader.
     - The question asks if it is likely that Elfin established command and control (C2) using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Tools:**
     - Custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader are tools typically used for data exfiltration. This indicates that the attackers have already gained access to the target network and have successfully exfiltrated data.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Tools:**
     - POSHC2 is a PowerShell-based C2 framework that allows attackers to maintain persistent access to a compromised system.
     - Quasar RAT (Remote Access Tool) is another tool that can be used for maintaining C2 and performing various malicious activities.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is common for attackers to establish C2 after exfiltrating data to maintain access and potentially perform further actions, such as lateral movement or additional data exfiltration.
     - The use of POSHC2 and Quasar RAT aligns with the typical behavior of advanced threat actors who need to maintain persistent access to a network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of actions and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, it is likely that Elfin established C2 using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT after exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
