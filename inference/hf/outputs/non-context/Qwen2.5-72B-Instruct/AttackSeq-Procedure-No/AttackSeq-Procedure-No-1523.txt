### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a loader that collects a wide range of data from the victim's system, including:
     - File manipulation
     - Process and service information
     - Screenshots
     - Command execution
     - Network tables
     - Registry keys
     - System information
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the loader will gather detailed information about the victim's computer, including:
     - Hostname
     - OS name and version
     - System type
     - User name
     - MAC addresses
     - Anti-virus information
   - This detailed information is to be gathered via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) queries.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - WMI is a powerful tool for gathering detailed system information on Windows systems.
     - The information listed (hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information) can all be obtained using WMI queries.
     - Given that the loader is already collecting a wide range of data, it is logical that it would also use WMI to gather additional detailed information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the loader would not gather the detailed information via WMI.
     - However, given the comprehensive nature of the data collection already described, it is unlikely that the loader would skip such a valuable and common method of gathering detailed system information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the detailed nature of the data collection already described and the common use of WMI for gathering system information, the most plausible answer is that the loader will indeed gather the detailed information via WMI queries.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
