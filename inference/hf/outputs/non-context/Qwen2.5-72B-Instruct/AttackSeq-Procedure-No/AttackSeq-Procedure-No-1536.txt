### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a script named `versioninfo.bat` is used to discover system details and collect information for exfiltration.
   - It then asks whether a UEFI rootkit like LoJax would manage the deletion of files such as `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs` to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Understanding UEFI Rootkits:**
     - UEFI rootkits, such as LoJax, are highly sophisticated malware that can persist across OS reinstallations by modifying the UEFI firmware. They are designed to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Purpose of UEFI Rootkits:**
     - UEFI rootkits typically focus on maintaining persistence and ensuring that the malware remains undetected. They do not usually handle the deletion of specific files used in the initial stages of an attack.
   - **File Deletion for Evasion:**
     - File deletion to evade detection is a common TTP, but it is typically performed by the malware itself or by a separate component of the attack, not by the UEFI rootkit.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves the initial information gathering and exfiltration, followed by the deletion of files to evade detection. This is a logical sequence, but the deletion is more likely to be handled by the malware or a separate component rather than the UEFI rootkit.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Information Gathering:**
     - The `versioninfo.bat` script is used to gather system details and collect information for exfiltration. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The collected information is exfiltrated, which is a necessary step for the attacker to gain insights into the target system.
   - **Evasion:**
     - To evade detection, the attacker might delete the `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs` files. This is a common TTP to remove traces of the initial infection.
   - **Role of UEFI Rootkit:**
     - While UEFI rootkits like LoJax are designed for persistence and evasion, they are not typically responsible for cleaning up files used in the initial stages of the attack. This task is more likely to be handled by the malware itself or a separate component.
