### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where adversaries use phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments to gain initial access.
   - Employees enable macros, which leads to the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will perform internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection to a C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through phishing emails with weaponized MS Office attachments, which is a common TTP (Tactic, Technique, and Procedure) used by adversaries.
   - **Malware Installation:**
     - Once the macros are enabled, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed. This is a known behavior of such weaponized attachments.
   - **Internal Network Reconnaissance and Credential Harvesting:**
     - After gaining a foothold in the network, it is common for malware to perform internal network reconnaissance to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets.
     - Credential harvesting is also a typical next step to gain additional access and move laterally within the network.
   - **Establishing C2 Connection:**
     - Establishing a connection to a C2 server is a critical step for the malware to receive further instructions and exfiltrate data.

3. **Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. After gaining initial access and installing the malware, it is logical for the malware to perform reconnaissance and credential harvesting to gather information and prepare for further actions.
   - Establishing a C2 connection is often a subsequent step, but it is not always the immediate next action. The malware may need to gather information and credentials first to ensure a more effective and stealthy operation.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
