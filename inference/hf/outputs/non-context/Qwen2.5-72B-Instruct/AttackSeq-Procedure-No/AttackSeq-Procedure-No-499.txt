### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a malware infection process.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a UAC (User Account Control) bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.
     - Downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site.
     - Using a script embedded in a malicious document to facilitate the download.
     - Using batch files in a multi-step process after the download.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **UAC Bypass:**
     - UAC bypass techniques are commonly used to gain elevated privileges without user interaction. This is a plausible first step in many malware infection processes.
   - **Downloading a Base64-Encoded CAB File:**
     - Downloading files from a remote site is a common technique used by malware to retrieve additional components or payloads. Encoding the file in base64 can help evade detection by simple signature-based security solutions.
   - **Script Embedded in a Malicious Document:**
     - Malicious documents often contain scripts (e.g., VBA macros) that can execute code to download and run additional malware components. This is a common initial infection vector.
   - **Using Batch Files in a Multi-Step Process:**
     - Batch files can be used to automate a series of commands, which is useful for executing a multi-step process. This is a plausible method for further stages of the infection process.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with common malware infection techniques.
   - UAC bypass is often used to gain elevated privileges, which can then be used to download and execute additional components.
   - The use of a script embedded in a malicious document to download a base64-encoded CAB file is a plausible method for initial infection.
   - Using batch files for a multi-step process after the download is a common technique to automate the execution of the malware.
