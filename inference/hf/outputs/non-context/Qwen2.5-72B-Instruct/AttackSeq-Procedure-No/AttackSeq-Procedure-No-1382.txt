### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Obtaining credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).
     - Obtaining credentials via trojanized KeePass binaries.
     - Delaying execution of core functionality using a timer.
     - Moving laterally in the network using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obtaining Credentials:**
     - Process memory dumping of LSASS is a common technique used to extract credentials from memory, often associated with tools like Mimikatz.
     - Trojanized KeePass binaries can also be used to steal credentials stored in password managers.
   - **Delaying Execution:**
     - Delaying execution of core functionality using a timer is a technique to evade detection and timing-based defenses. This can be done to ensure that the malicious activity occurs at a less suspicious time or to avoid immediate detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - WMI is a common method for lateral movement, allowing attackers to execute commands on remote systems.
     - Custom web shells can be used to maintain persistence and execute commands on web servers, facilitating further lateral movement.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible for an advanced threat actor like FIN13. Advanced threat actors often use a combination of credential theft, evasion techniques, and lateral movement to achieve their objectives.
   - The use of a timer to delay execution is a common tactic to avoid immediate detection and to align with the attacker's operational timeline.
   - The combination of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement is also a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
