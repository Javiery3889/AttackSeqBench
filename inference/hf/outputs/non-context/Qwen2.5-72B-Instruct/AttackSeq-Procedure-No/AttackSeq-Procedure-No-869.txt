### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Scanning for files and staging data for exfiltration during the Collection phase.
     - Sending data to a primary C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Using a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration for communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that data will be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
     - This is less likely because typically, the primary C&C server is the first point of contact for the malware. The fallback C&C server is used if the primary server is unavailable or if the primary communication channel is compromised.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that data will not be sent to the primary C&C server only after the fallback C&C server becomes operational.
     - This is more plausible because the primary C&C server is usually the primary communication channel, and the fallback C&C server is used as a backup.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that data will be sent to the primary C&C server first, and the fallback C&C server will be used if the primary server is unavailable.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is: "No."

**Final Answer: B: No**
