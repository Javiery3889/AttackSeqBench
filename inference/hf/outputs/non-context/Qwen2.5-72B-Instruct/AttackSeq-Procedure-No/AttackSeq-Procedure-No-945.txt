### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus Group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using system utilities (ipconfig.exe and ping.exe) for reconnaissance.
     - Gaining initial access through malicious documents with job offers.
     - Leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
     - Using `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance with System Utilities:**
     - Using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance is a common initial step to gather information about the network and system configurations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gaining initial access through malicious documents with job offers is a known technique used by the Lazarus Group. This often involves social engineering to trick victims into opening malicious files.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors, including the Lazarus Group. This allows them to move through the network with higher privileges.
   - **Network Share Discovery:**
     - Using `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery is a logical next step after gaining access and moving laterally. These tools help identify and access shared resources on the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with the known TTPs of the Lazarus Group.
   - The use of system utilities for reconnaissance, gaining initial access through social engineering, leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement, and then using specific tools for network share discovery is a logical and common attack pattern.
