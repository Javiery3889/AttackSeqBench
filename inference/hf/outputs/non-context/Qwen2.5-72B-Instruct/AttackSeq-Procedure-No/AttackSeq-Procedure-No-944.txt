### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through watering hole tactics.
   - The initial access exploits CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, custom shellcode is executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use parent PID spoofing to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Watering hole tactics involve compromising a website that the target is likely to visit.
     - Exploiting CVE-2020-0674 (a vulnerability in Microsoft Office) and CVE-2019-5782 (a vulnerability in Adobe Flash) can provide initial access to the target system.
   - **Execution of Custom Shellcode:**
     - Custom shellcode is often used to perform additional actions, such as downloading and running a PowerShell loader.
   - **PowerShell Loader:**
     - A PowerShell loader can be used to download and execute additional payloads, such as backdoors.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is a common next step after gaining initial access to elevate the attacker's privileges on the system.
     - Parent PID spoofing is a technique where an attacker creates a process with a spoofed parent process ID to make it appear as if the process was started by a legitimate system process. This can help in evading detection and gaining higher privileges.
   - **Likelihood of Parent PID Spoofing:**
     - Parent PID spoofing is a sophisticated technique that can be used to execute backdoors with system privileges.
     - Given the level of sophistication in the initial attack (using multiple CVEs and custom shellcode), it is plausible that the attackers would use advanced techniques like parent PID spoofing for privilege escalation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the attackers will use parent PID spoofing to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
