### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware has executed the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information and process lists.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will use a SOCK5 proxy between infected hosts for its command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Understanding the Command:**
     - The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is used to gather detailed information about the system and running processes. This is a common initial step in many malware operations to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **SOCK5 Proxy:**
     - A SOCK5 proxy is a type of proxy server that routes network traffic between a client and a server using the SOCKS protocol. It is often used to anonymize traffic or to bypass network restrictions.
   - **C2 Operations:**
     - Command and control (C2) operations involve the malware communicating with a remote server to receive instructions, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.
   - **Likelihood of Using a SOCK5 Proxy:**
     - While the use of a SOCK5 proxy can help in anonymizing traffic and evading detection, it is not a common or necessary step immediately after gathering system information and process lists.
     - Malware often uses more straightforward methods for C2, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS requests, especially in the initial stages of an attack.
     - The use of a SOCK5 proxy is more likely to be employed in more advanced or sophisticated attacks where the attacker needs to maintain a low profile or bypass specific network defenses.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the initial stage of the attack described (gathering system information and process lists), it is less likely that the malware will immediately use a SOCK5 proxy for C2 operations. More common methods are typically used first.

**Final Answer: B: No**
