### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence starts with lateral movement techniques such as using direct shell commands or Cobalt Strike features (psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, ssh) to propagate beacons to other systems within the network.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process after achieving lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The techniques mentioned (psexec, psexec_psh, winrm, ssh) are commonly used for lateral movement. These tools allow attackers to move from one compromised system to another within the network.
   - **Discovery:**
     - After gaining access to additional systems, attackers often need to understand the network and Active Directory structure to identify valuable targets and plan further actions.
     - Tools like ADFind and port scanning are commonly used for this purpose:
       - **ADFind:** This tool is used to query Active Directory and gather information about users, groups, and other objects.
       - **Port Scanning:** This technique is used to identify open ports and services on network devices, which can help in identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common progression in cyber attacks:
     1. **Lateral Movement:** Using tools to move through the network.
     2. **Discovery:** Using tools to gather information about the network and Active Directory.
   - It is highly likely that after achieving lateral movement, attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather more information and plan their next steps.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
