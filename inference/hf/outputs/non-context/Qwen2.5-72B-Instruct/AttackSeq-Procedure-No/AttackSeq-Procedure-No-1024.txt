### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information and sends it to a C&C (Command and Control) server.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that both NetFlash and PyFlash will use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - HTTPS is a secure protocol that uses SSL/TLS for encryption, which can include asymmetric cryptography.
     - Asymmetric cryptography is commonly used in HTTPS to establish a secure connection and exchange keys.
     - It is plausible that sophisticated malware like PyFlash and NetFlash would use HTTPS to communicate with their C&C servers to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the malware does not use HTTPS, it would be more vulnerable to detection and interception.
     - However, some malware might use custom encryption or other protocols to communicate with C&C servers, but this is less common and more complex to implement.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of modern malware, it is highly likely that PyFlash and NetFlash would use HTTPS for secure communication with their C&C servers.
   - HTTPS provides a standard and effective way to secure communications, making it a common choice for malware to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
