### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using an LNK file to initiate multi-stage commands.
     - Executing a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase.
     - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence.
     - Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The LNK file is used to initiate the attack.
     - A JavaScript file is executed as part of the attack.
     - The question asks if the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - **Logical Order:**
     - Typically, in a multi-stage attack, the initial stages focus on gaining a foothold and executing the payload.
     - Persistence mechanisms (like copying files to the startup directory or adding tasks to scheduled tasks) are often implemented to ensure the malware remains active even after the initial execution.
     - The order of these actions can vary, but it is common to establish persistence in multiple ways to increase the likelihood of the malware surviving system reboots or other disruptions.
   - **Specific Order in the Question:**
     - The question suggests a specific order: adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks before copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
     - This order is not inherently illogical, but it is not a common or necessary sequence. Both actions can be performed independently to achieve persistence.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in multi-stage attacks and the flexibility in the order of persistence mechanisms, it is not necessarily the case that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely to follow this specific order.

**Final Answer: B: No**
