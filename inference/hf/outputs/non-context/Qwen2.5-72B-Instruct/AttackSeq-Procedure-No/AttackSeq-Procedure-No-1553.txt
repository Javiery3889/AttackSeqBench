### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Freakyshelly attackers.
   - The sequence involves gaining initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers use a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via OLE2 Format Documents:**
     - OLE2 (Object Linking and Embedding) format documents can contain embedded objects, such as links or scripts, which can be used to execute malicious code when opened.
     - Spear phishing emails are a common method for delivering such documents to targets.
   - **Reconnaissance via GET Request:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, attackers often perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment.
     - Microsoft Word can be configured to send HTTP requests to external servers, which can be used to exfiltrate information about the installed software or other system details.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - OLE2 format documents are a known method for delivering malware via spear phishing.
     - Once the document is opened, the embedded link can trigger a GET request to a remote server, which can be used for reconnaissance.
     - This technique aligns with the typical attack flow where initial access is followed by reconnaissance to gather information about the target.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
