### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution of a malicious macro from an MS Office document.
     - Downloading the RMS tool and supporting scripts.
     - Achieving persistence using the `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command in MS-SQL.
     - Attempting to kill the `rundll32.exe` process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Malicious Macro Execution:**
     - This is a common initial access technique where a macro in an MS Office document is used to execute malicious code.
   - **Downloading RMS Tool and Supporting Scripts:**
     - After gaining initial access, threat actors often download additional tools and scripts to further their objectives.
   - **Achieving Persistence with `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin`:**
     - The `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` command in MS-SQL is used to create a linked server login, which can be a method to achieve persistence by ensuring that the threat actor can maintain access to the network.
   - **Killing `rundll32.exe`:**
     - `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to run DLLs. Threat actors might attempt to kill it if it is running a security tool or if it is interfering with their operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible, but the order of the steps needs to be evaluated:
     - **Initial Access and Downloading Tools:**
       - The execution of the malicious macro and downloading of the RMS tool and scripts are logical first steps.
     - **Achieving Persistence:**
       - Using `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` to create a linked server login is a reasonable step to achieve persistence, but it is more likely to be done after ensuring that the initial foothold is secure and the necessary tools are in place.
     - **Killing `rundll32.exe`:**
       - Killing `rundll32.exe` is a more tactical step that might be done to avoid detection or to stop a security tool. However, it is less likely to be a primary step in achieving persistence.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible because:
     - Achieving persistence with `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin` is a logical step, but it is more likely to be done after ensuring the initial foothold and downloading necessary tools.
     - Killing `rundll32.exe` is a tactical step that might be done to avoid detection, but it is not a primary step in achieving persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
