### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Hopping:** Moving from one set of credentials to another to gain access to different systems or accounts.
     - **Configuring Malware (TrailBlazer) for WMI Persistence:** Using the TrailBlazer malware to maintain persistence on a system via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the campaign will generate repeated MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) requests to access victim accounts before using web session cookies for credential access to cloud resources.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Hopping and WMI Persistence:**
     - These techniques are typically used to gain and maintain access to a network or system. Credential hopping allows the attacker to move laterally, while WMI persistence ensures that the attacker can maintain access over time.
   - **Repeated MFA Requests:**
     - Generating repeated MFA requests is a common tactic used to bypass MFA. However, this is often a noisy and detectable activity, which might alert the victim or security systems.
   - **Using Web Session Cookies for Credential Access:**
     - Web session cookies can be used to maintain access to a web application without needing to re-authenticate. This is a stealthier method compared to generating repeated MFA requests.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the StellarParticle campaign has already utilized credential hopping and configured malware for persistence, it is likely that the attackers are trying to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.
   - Generating repeated MFA requests is a high-risk activity that can trigger alerts and potentially lock out the attacker.
   - Using web session cookies is a more subtle and effective method for maintaining access to cloud resources without triggering MFA prompts.

### Final Answer:
B: No
