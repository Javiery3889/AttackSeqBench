### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a script named `stopedge.bat` is used to delete files like `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs` as a means of defense evasion.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that persistence will be established using kernel modules, similar to techniques employed by malware like Drovorub or Skidmap.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Deletion of Files):**
     - The deletion of files such as `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs` is a common technique used to remove traces of the malware or to prevent detection and analysis. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host).
   - **Persistence Using Kernel Modules:**
     - Establishing persistence using kernel modules is a sophisticated technique that involves modifying or loading kernel-level components to ensure the malware remains active even after system reboots. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1543 (Create or Modify System Process) and T1055 (Process Injection).
     - Malware like Drovorub and Skidmap are known for their use of kernel modules to achieve persistence and maintain a low profile. Drovorub, for example, is a Linux backdoor that uses kernel modules to hide its presence and maintain persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial step of deleting files to evade detection is a common and relatively simple technique.
   - Following this, it is plausible that the attacker would want to ensure the malware remains persistent on the system. Using kernel modules is a highly effective method for achieving this, especially for sophisticated malware.
   - The mention of Drovorub and Skidmap, which are known for their use of kernel modules, further supports the likelihood of this sequence of TTPs.
