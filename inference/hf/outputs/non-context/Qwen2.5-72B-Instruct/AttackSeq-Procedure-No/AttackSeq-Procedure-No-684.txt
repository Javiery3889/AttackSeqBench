### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     - Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     - Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
     - Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deploying Worms:**
     - Worms are often used to spread malware and scan for vulnerable hosts. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Exploiting Exposed Docker API Ports:**
     - Once the worms identify misconfigured hosts, attackers can exploit exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access. This is a plausible next step.
   - **Deleting Shadow Volumes:**
     - Deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is a technique often used to remove backups and hinder recovery efforts. This is typically done to cover tracks and prevent system administrators from restoring the system to a previous state.
   - **Resource Hijacking:**
     - The ultimate objective is to hijack resources using malicious container images. This involves deploying and running malicious containers to utilize the host's resources for the attacker's benefit.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Reconnaissance and Scanning:**
        - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     2. **Initial Access:**
        - Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain access.
     3. **Persistence and Anti-Forensics:**
        - Deleting shadow volumes to hinder recovery and forensic analysis.
     4. **Achieving the Objective:**
        - Hijacking resources through malicious container images.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The step of deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is a plausible and logical part of the attack sequence. It helps the attackers cover their tracks and prevent system recovery, which is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is logical and plausible, but the step of deleting shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is not typically a necessary step before achieving the objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images. It is more likely to be a post-access step to hinder recovery and forensic analysis. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attackers would not necessarily delete shadow volumes before achieving their ultimate objective.
