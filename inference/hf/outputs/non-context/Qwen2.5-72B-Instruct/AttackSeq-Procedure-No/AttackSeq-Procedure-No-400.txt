### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by GHOLE malware:
     - **Persistence:** Using a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs'.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Creating a mutex called 'woolger'.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that GHOLE malware will use legitimate websites such as GitHub or Pastebin through dead drop resolvers to communicate with its C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (VBScript 'wsc.vbs'):**
     - VBScript is a common method for achieving persistence on Windows systems. It can be used to run scripts at system startup or at regular intervals.
   - **Defense Evasion (Mutex 'woolger'):**
     - Creating a mutex is a technique used to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Using legitimate websites like GitHub or Pastebin for C&C communication is a known technique called "dead drop resolvers" or "web shell communication." This method helps malware evade detection by blending in with normal web traffic.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given that GHOLE malware has already employed sophisticated techniques for persistence and defense evasion, it is plausible that it would also use advanced methods for C&C communication.
   - Using legitimate websites for C&C communication is a common tactic in modern malware to avoid detection and maintain a low profile.
