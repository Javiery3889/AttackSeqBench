### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Establish command and control (C2) through Process Hollowing.
     2. Achieve persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
     3. Perform discovery by obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establish Command and Control (C2) through Process Hollowing:**
     - Process Hollowing is a technique where a legitimate process is started in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then the process is resumed. This is often used to establish a covert C2 channel.
   - **Achieve Persistence by Creating a RunOnce Key in the Registry:**
     - Persistence is a tactic where the malware ensures it can maintain access to the system over time. Creating a RunOnce key in the registry is a common method to achieve this, as it ensures the malware runs at the next system startup.
   - **Perform Discovery by Obtaining the User Name and Identifying the Explorer Process:**
     - Discovery is a tactic where the malware gathers information about the system and its environment. Obtaining the user name and identifying the explorer process are common discovery actions.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **C2 Establishment:** The malware needs to establish a C2 channel to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - **Persistence:** Once the C2 channel is established, the malware might want to ensure it can survive system reboots by creating a persistence mechanism.
     - **Discovery:** After ensuring persistence, the malware can then gather information about the system, such as the user name and the explorer process, to better understand its environment and plan further actions.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible. It follows a logical progression where the malware first establishes a C2 channel, then ensures persistence, and finally performs discovery to gather information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and plausibility, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
