### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware is using HTTPS communication for command and control (C2) operations.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists using the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
     - Malware often uses HTTPS for C2 to communicate with its operators, receive commands, and exfiltrate data. This is a common technique to avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **System Information and Process Lists:**
     - Discovering system information and process lists is a common post-exploitation activity. Malware often gathers this information to understand the environment it is operating in, identify potential targets, and avoid detection.
     - The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is a typical way to gather this information. `tasklist` provides a list of running processes, and `systeminfo` provides detailed system information.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware is already using HTTPS for C2, it is likely that the next step in the attack sequence would be to gather information about the system and running processes.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` is a straightforward and effective way to achieve this.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the malware would use this command to gather the necessary information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
