### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Iron Tiger malware has achieved persistence on a victim's machine by creating a new service or registry key.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the malware will download additional payloads using a command-and-control (C2) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via New Service or Registry Key:**
     - Creating a new service or registry key is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a form of persistence.
   - **Downloading Additional Payloads:**
     - Once persistence is established, it is common for malware to communicate with a C2 server to download additional payloads. This can include additional malware, tools, or updates to the existing malware.
   - **Iron Tiger Malware:**
     - Iron Tiger is known to use a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and to download additional payloads. It often communicates with a C2 server to receive commands and additional malware.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that Iron Tiger malware has established persistence, it is highly likely that it will use a C2 server to download additional payloads. This is a common behavior for sophisticated malware to expand its capabilities and maintain control over the infected system.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
