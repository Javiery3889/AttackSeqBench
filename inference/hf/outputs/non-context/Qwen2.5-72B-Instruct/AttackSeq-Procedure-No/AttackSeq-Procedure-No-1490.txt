### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by BlackEnergy 3.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell using the `RegSetValueExw()` function.
     - Using the open-source port scanner WinEggDrop to perform detailed scans of hosts of interest.
     - Sending the scanned information to command and control (C2) servers located in European ISPs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the Startup Shell:**
     - This is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. BlackEnergy 3 is known to use such techniques to maintain a foothold in the victim's system.
   - **Using WinEggDrop for Scanning:**
     - WinEggDrop is an open-source port scanner, but it is not typically associated with BlackEnergy 3. BlackEnergy 3 usually uses its own built-in or custom tools for network scanning and reconnaissance.
   - **Sending Information to C2 Servers:**
     - BlackEnergy 3 is known to communicate with C2 servers to exfiltrate data and receive further instructions. The location of these servers (European ISPs) is plausible, as attackers often use geographically diverse C2 infrastructure to avoid detection and attribution.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The first part of the sequence (registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell) is consistent with BlackEnergy 3's known TTPs.
   - The use of WinEggDrop, however, is less likely. BlackEnergy 3 typically uses more sophisticated and custom tools for network scanning, which are better integrated with its overall attack framework.
   - The final part (sending information to C2 servers) is also consistent with BlackEnergy 3's behavior.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the use of WinEggDrop is the least plausible part of the sequence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
