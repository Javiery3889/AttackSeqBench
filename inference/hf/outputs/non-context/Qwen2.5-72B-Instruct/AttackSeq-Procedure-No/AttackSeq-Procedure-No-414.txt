### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor UNC1945.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance:** Using custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation.
     - **Discovery:** Further internal scanning and network exploitation.
     - **Abuse of OAuth access tokens:** Gaining access to target email accounts.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Moving to a Windows server via RDP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that UNC1945 will indeed abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.
     - This aligns with the sequence described in the question, where the threat actor uses OAuth tokens to access email accounts and then moves laterally using RDP.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that UNC1945 will not abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.
     - This does not align with the sequence described in the question, as the question explicitly states that the threat actor will use OAuth tokens before moving laterally.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible answer is that UNC1945 will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
