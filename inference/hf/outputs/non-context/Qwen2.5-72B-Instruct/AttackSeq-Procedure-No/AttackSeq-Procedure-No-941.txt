### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SLUB malware.
   - The sequence includes exfiltration of system information and screenshots via a Mattermost server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect system information and capture screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server under the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The malware has already exfiltrated system information and screenshots via the Mattermost server.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase typically involves the malware gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
     - Collecting system information and capturing screenshots are common techniques used during the Discovery phase to gather intelligence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The fact that the malware has already exfiltrated system information and screenshots suggests that it has the capability to collect such data.
   - It is plausible that the malware would continue to collect system information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase to gather more detailed information about the environment.
   - The use of the same Mattermost server for exfiltration and interaction during the Discovery phase is consistent with the malware's behavior, as it maintains a consistent communication channel.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
