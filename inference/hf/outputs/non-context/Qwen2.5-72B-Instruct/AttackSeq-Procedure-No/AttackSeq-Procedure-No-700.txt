### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has achieved persistence by creating and importing OS-specific registry entries using the CT/NewCT implant.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use email for command and control (C2) via an Office macro.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Registry Entries:**
     - Creating and importing OS-specific registry entries is a common technique for achieving persistence. This is often done to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts.
   - **CT/NewCT Implant:**
     - The CT/NewCT implant is a specific piece of malware that is known to use registry entries for persistence.
   - **Moafee and DragonOK:**
     - Moafee and DragonOK are not well-known malware families or threat actors. The names seem to be a mix-up or a typo. However, for the sake of this question, we will assume they are threat actors or malware families.
   - **Email for C2 via Office Macro:**
     - Using email for C2 is a less common method compared to more direct methods like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS. However, it is not unheard of. Office macros can be used to execute code and establish C2, but this is typically more complex and less stealthy than other methods.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and C2:**
     - The use of registry entries for persistence is a well-established technique and aligns with the initial part of the attack sequence.
   - **C2 via Email:**
     - While it is possible to use email for C2, it is not the most common or efficient method. Threat actors typically prefer more direct and less traceable methods.
   - **Office Macros:**
     - Office macros can be used for C2, but they are more commonly used for initial infection or to download additional payloads. Using them for ongoing C2 is less common and more likely to be detected.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the less common and less efficient nature of using email for C2 via Office macros, it is less likely that Moafee and DragonOK would use this method.

### Final Answer: B: No
