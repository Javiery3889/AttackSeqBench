### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence by the SideWinder APT group.
   - The group initially exploited CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group installed loadable kernel modules for privilege escalation before employing techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2019-2215:**
     - CVE-2019-2215 is a vulnerability in the Android operating system that can be exploited to gain initial access to a device.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Installing loadable kernel modules (LKMs) is a common technique for privilege escalation in Linux and Android environments. LKMs can provide attackers with root access, allowing them to perform more advanced and stealthy operations.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation are techniques used to evade detection by security tools and analysts. These techniques are often employed after gaining initial access and privilege escalation to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Initial Access:** The group gains initial access using CVE-2019-2215.
     - **Privilege Escalation:** To perform more advanced actions, the group would likely need to escalate their privileges. Installing LKMs is a plausible and effective method for achieving this.
     - **Evasion:** Once the group has elevated privileges, they would then use techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to avoid detection and maintain their presence on the infected machines.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical attack sequence and the effectiveness of LKMs for privilege escalation, it is highly likely that the SideWinder APT group would install loadable kernel modules after gaining initial access and before employing evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
