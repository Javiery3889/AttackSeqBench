### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Securing access to ICS (Industrial Control Systems) control workstations and servers.
     - Conducting host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.
   - The question then asks if GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework during resource development with functionality defined by uploaded modules to targeted systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - GreyEnergy is known for using sophisticated and modular malware frameworks. This aligns with the group's known capabilities and tactics.
     - The use of modular malware allows for flexibility and adaptability, which is a common characteristic of advanced threat actors like GreyEnergy.
     - The sequence described in the question (securing access, reconnaissance, and then resource development) is a logical progression in a cyber attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy would not use a modular malware framework during resource development.
     - Given the group's known sophistication and the logical progression of the attack sequence, this choice is less plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that GreyEnergy will use a modular malware framework during resource development.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
