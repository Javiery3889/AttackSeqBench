### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers modified a Javascript file on a CDN server to deliver malicious code to targeted websites.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers used legitimate local admin account credentials for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using legitimate local admin account credentials is a common technique for defense evasion. This allows attackers to perform actions that are less likely to trigger security alerts, as the actions appear to be performed by a trusted user.
     - In the context of modifying a file on a server, having legitimate admin credentials would provide the necessary permissions to make such changes without raising immediate suspicion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the attackers did not use legitimate local admin account credentials, they would need to find another way to gain the necessary permissions to modify the file. This could involve exploiting a vulnerability, using stolen credentials, or other methods.
     - However, using legitimate credentials is often the most straightforward and effective method for defense evasion, especially in a scenario where the attackers need to make changes to a server.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the context of modifying a file on a server to deliver malicious code, it is highly likely that the attackers would use legitimate local admin account credentials to avoid detection and ensure the changes are made without raising alarms.
   - The use of legitimate credentials aligns well with the goal of defense evasion and is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
