### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers:
     1. Lock out the original owners by changing the passwords.
     2. Demand ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.
     3. Collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers will indeed collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites after demanding ransom payments.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers will not collect Instagram credentials through phishing sites after demanding ransom payments.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Locking Out Original Owners:**
     - Changing passwords to lock out the original owners is a common tactic in account takeover attacks.
   - **Demanding Ransom Payments:**
     - Demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts is a common tactic in ransomware and account takeover attacks.
   - **Collecting Instagram Credentials Through Phishing Sites:**
     - Collecting additional credentials through phishing sites is a separate and distinct action that is typically used to gain initial access or to expand the scope of the attack.
     - It is less common for attackers to engage in phishing after they have already compromised the accounts and are demanding ransom payments. This is because the primary goal of demanding ransom is to get the victim to pay, and additional phishing might complicate the process or alert the victim to further security measures.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in such attacks, it is less likely that the attackers would engage in phishing for Instagram credentials after they have already locked out the original owners and are demanding ransom payments. The primary focus would be on getting the ransom paid.

### Final Answer: B: No
