### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Gamaredon group gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will achieve persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry before executing a macro code that runs a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures. This is a common tactic used by various threat actors, including Gamaredon, to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry is a common method for achieving persistence. This allows the malware to run automatically every time the system starts.
   - **Macro Code and VBScript Execution:**
     - Executing a macro code that runs a VBScript using 'wscript.exe' is a typical sequence of actions after gaining initial access. The macro code is often used to download and execute additional payloads, such as the VBScript.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of malicious document files and COVID-19 lures is a well-documented technique used by Gamaredon. This aligns with the initial access phase of the attack.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry is a common persistence mechanism. It ensures that the malware runs every time the system starts, which is a logical next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Macro Code and VBScript Execution:**
     - The execution of a macro code that runs a VBScript using 'wscript.exe' is a typical sequence of actions. The macro code is often used to download and execute additional payloads, which can include the VBScript.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of actions and the common tactics used by Gamaredon, it is likely that the group will achieve persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry before executing a macro code that runs a VBScript using 'wscript.exe'.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
