### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an adversary has already collected email messages from both local and remote systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the adversary would use the PsLogList tool to identify privileged users during the discovery phase.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - PsLogList is a tool from the Sysinternals suite that can be used to list event logs from local or remote systems. It is often used for forensic analysis and can provide detailed information about system events, including user activities and logins.
     - During the discovery phase, an adversary might use PsLogList to gather information about system events, which could include identifying privileged users. For example, event logs can show when and how often certain users log in, what actions they perform, and which accounts have elevated privileges.
     - Therefore, it is plausible that an adversary would use PsLogList to identify privileged users as part of their discovery activities.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the adversary would not use PsLogList to identify privileged users during the discovery phase.
     - However, given the capabilities of PsLogList and the common use of event logs for identifying user activities and privileges, this answer is less likely to be correct.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary would use PsLogList to identify privileged users during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
