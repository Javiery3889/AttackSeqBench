### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor BRONZE PRESIDENT.
   - The sequence includes the use of scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations during the Collection phase.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The use of scripts to collect files from specific locations is a common technique in the Collection phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This is often done to gather sensitive data or files that the attacker is interested in exfiltrating.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - C2 communication is a critical phase where the attacker maintains control over the compromised system. Common C2 protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and custom protocols.
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is primarily used for transferring files and is not typically used for C2 communication due to its lack of encryption and the ease with which it can be detected and blocked by network security measures.
   - **BRONZE PRESIDENT's TTPs:**
     - BRONZE PRESIDENT, like many sophisticated threat actors, is likely to use more secure and stealthy methods for C2 communication to avoid detection. Protocols like HTTPS, which provide encryption and are commonly used for web traffic, are more likely to be used for C2.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the nature of FTP and the typical TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors, it is unlikely that BRONZE PRESIDENT would use FTP for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
