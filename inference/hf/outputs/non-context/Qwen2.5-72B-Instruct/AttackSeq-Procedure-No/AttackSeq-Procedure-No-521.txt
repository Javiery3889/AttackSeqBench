### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
     - Executing an embedded .hta file using mshta.exe.
     - Utilizing Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - The attacker has already achieved persistence by scheduling a task to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes. This is a common technique to ensure that the malware runs periodically and maintains a foothold in the system.
   - **Executing .hta File:**
     - The .hta file is executed using mshta.exe. This is a common technique to run malicious scripts or download additional payloads.
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2017-0199:**
     - CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, often through a malicious Word document. This is typically used for initial access to the system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the .hta file was executed using mshta.exe only after the initial access was achieved via CVE-2017-0199.
   - The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the attacker first achieved persistence and then executed the .hta file. However, the initial access via CVE-2017-0199 is a prerequisite for the attacker to gain control of the system and schedule the task.
   - Therefore, it is logical to assume that the initial access via CVE-2017-0199 occurred before the persistence mechanism was set up and the .hta file was executed.
