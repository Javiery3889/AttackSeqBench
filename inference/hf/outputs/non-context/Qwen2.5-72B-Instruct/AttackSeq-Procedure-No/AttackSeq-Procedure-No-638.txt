### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PIVY variant.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **DLL Sideloading:** A technique where the malware loads a legitimate application and injects a malicious DLL to execute its code.
     - **Configuration Modification:** The malware modifies its configuration to confuse tools that parse configuration data.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Sideloading and Configuration Modification:**
     - These techniques are often used to evade detection and maintain persistence on the victim's system.
     - DLL sideloading allows the malware to run without being directly detected, and configuration modification can make it harder for security tools to identify the malware's behavior.
   - **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA):**
     - DGAs are used by malware to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communications.
     - DGAs are particularly useful for evading domain blacklisting and ensuring that the malware can maintain communication with its C2 server even if some domains are blocked.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of DLL sideloading and configuration modification indicates that the malware is designed to be stealthy and resilient.
   - Given the malware's focus on evasion and persistence, it is logical to assume that it would also use advanced techniques to maintain C2 communications.
   - DGAs are a common and effective method for ensuring that C2 communications remain robust and difficult to disrupt.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the PIVY variant would use a DGA for C2 communications to complement its other evasion techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
