### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence involves deploying a password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS during the Credential Access phase.
   - The question then asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to scan the environment, report back to a central server, and centralize discovered information only before accessing credentials through LSASS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - Deploying a password dumper to access credentials from LSASS is a common technique used in the Credential Access phase. This is a well-documented TTP for APT28.
   - **Scanning and Information Centralization:**
     - Using geographically distributed bots to scan the environment and centralize discovered information is more typical of the Discovery and Collection phases.
     - These activities are usually performed before or after the Credential Access phase, but not necessarily in the immediate sequence described in the question.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the scanning and information centralization activities are performed only after the Credential Access phase, which is not a typical or efficient sequence for APT28.
     - APT28 is known for its efficient and targeted operations, and it is more likely to perform scanning and information gathering before or concurrently with Credential Access to better understand the environment and target specific systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible for APT28. APT28 is more likely to perform scanning and information gathering before or concurrently with Credential Access, rather than only after.

**Final Answer: B: No**
