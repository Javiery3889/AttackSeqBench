### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the automatic exfiltration of AWS credentials over a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will establish contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of AWS Credentials:**
     - This is a common TTP where attackers steal sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources.
   - **Establishing Contact with C2 Servers:**
     - After exfiltrating credentials, attackers often need to maintain persistent communication with their C2 servers to control the compromised system and exfiltrate more data.
   - **Downloading Shell Scripts:**
     - Downloading shell scripts is a common technique used by attackers to automate tasks, such as setting up backdoors, downloading additional malware, or executing commands on the compromised system.
   - **Encoding Malicious Binary Files:**
     - Encoding or obfuscating malicious binary files is a technique used to evade detection by security tools. This can include encoding the files in base64, using packers, or other obfuscation methods.

3. **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible:
     - **Exfiltration of AWS credentials** is a common initial step in cloud-based attacks.
     - **Establishing contact with C2 servers** is a necessary step for maintaining control and furthering the attack.
     - **Downloading shell scripts** is a common method for automating attack tasks.
     - **Encoding malicious binary files** is a common technique to avoid detection and ensure the persistence and success of the attack.
