### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging built-in lateral movement capabilities in Cobalt Strike.
     - Identifying target systems and data of interest.
     - Cloning victim user Git repositories.
     - Exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Leveraging built-in lateral movement capabilities in Cobalt Strike:**
     - Cobalt Strike is a popular penetration testing tool that includes various lateral movement techniques, such as PsExec, WMI, and SMB.
     - This step is plausible and commonly used in advanced attacks to move laterally within a network.

   - **Identifying target systems and data of interest:**
     - Once the adversary has moved laterally, they would typically perform reconnaissance to identify valuable systems and data.
     - This step is also plausible and a standard part of the attack lifecycle.

   - **Cloning victim user Git repositories:**
     - Cloning Git repositories is a specific action that an adversary might take if they are interested in source code or other sensitive information stored in version control systems.
     - This step is more targeted and specific, and it would depend on the adversary's objectives and the presence of Git repositories on the target systems.

   - **Exfiltrating data using cloud storage web services:**
     - Exfiltrating data using cloud storage services is a common method for transferring stolen data out of the network.
     - This step is plausible and often used to avoid detection by traditional network monitoring tools.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is generally plausible. However, the step of cloning Git repositories is more specific and might not be a common action in every attack scenario.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will clone Git repositories before exfiltrating data. This implies a high degree of certainty that the adversary will take this specific action.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the specific nature of cloning Git repositories, it is not necessarily a common or guaranteed step in every attack sequence. Therefore, it is not likely that the adversary will always clone Git repositories before exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
