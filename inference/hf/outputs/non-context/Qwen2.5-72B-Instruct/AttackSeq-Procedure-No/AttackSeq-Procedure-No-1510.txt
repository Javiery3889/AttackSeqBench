### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Carbanak group using LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising Domain Administrator credentials and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning:** This technique involves responding to network requests for name resolution (LLMNR) or NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) with the attacker's own IP address, allowing the attacker to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
   - **SMB Relay:** This technique involves capturing and relaying SMB (Server Message Block) authentication requests to gain access to network resources.
   - **Mapping the Internal Network:** This involves discovering the structure and layout of the internal network, including identifying hosts, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Collecting Administrative-Level Credentials:** This involves obtaining credentials that have high-level access to the network, such as those of local administrators.
   - **Compromising Domain Administrator Credentials:** This involves obtaining credentials that have domain-wide administrative privileges.
   - **Compromising Additional Endpoints:** This involves using the compromised credentials to gain access to and control additional systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** These techniques are commonly used in the initial stages of an attack to gather information and credentials. They are effective for intercepting and relaying authentication requests, which can help in mapping the network and collecting administrative-level credentials.
   - **Mapping the Internal Network:** Once the attacker has some level of access, they can use the collected information to map the internal network and identify potential targets.
   - **Collecting Administrative-Level Credentials:** With the network mapped and some initial access, the attacker can focus on collecting more valuable credentials, such as those of local administrators.
   - **Compromising Domain Administrator Credentials:** After gaining access to administrative-level credentials, the next logical step is to escalate privileges to domain administrator level, which provides extensive control over the network.
   - **Compromising Additional Endpoints:** With domain administrator credentials, the attacker can easily compromise additional endpoints and move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common attack pattern. The Carbanak group is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks, and the use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to map the network and collect credentials aligns with their known tactics.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
