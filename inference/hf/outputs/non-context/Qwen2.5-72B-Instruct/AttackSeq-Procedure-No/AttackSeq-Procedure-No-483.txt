### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Running `cmd.exe` commands to execute SparrowDoor.
     - Communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework where the attacker gains a foothold in the network. Common techniques include exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing, and using remote services.
   - **Execution:** This involves running malicious code on the victim's system. In this case, `cmd.exe` is used to execute SparrowDoor.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The communication with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel is a common technique for maintaining control.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of SparrowDoor exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access.
   - Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications is a common method for gaining initial access. This is because internet-facing applications are often exposed to the internet and can be targeted by attackers.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute SparrowDoor and the communication with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel are consistent with the behavior of a malware that has already gained initial access and is now executing and maintaining control.
   - Given the context, it is plausible that the initial access was gained through exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in an internet-facing application.

### Final Answer:
