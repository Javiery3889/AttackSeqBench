### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Stealing clipboard contents.
     - Capturing screenshots.
     - Staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.
   - The question then asks if Machete is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more before exfiltrating them.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Machete will divide files if they are 16 MB or larger before exfiltrating them.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Machete will not divide files if they are 16 MB or larger before exfiltrating them.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Stealing Clipboard Contents and Capturing Screenshots:**
     - These are common data exfiltration techniques used by malware to gather sensitive information.
   - **Staging Encrypted Data in a Temporary Folder:**
     - This is a typical step in the exfiltration process to prepare the data for transfer.
   - **Dividing Files if Size is 0x1000000 Bytes or More:**
     - Dividing large files before exfiltration is a common practice in malware to avoid detection and to ensure successful transmission. Large files can be more easily detected by network monitoring tools and can cause issues with file transfer protocols.
     - Given that Machete is a sophisticated piece of malware, it is likely to include such a feature to enhance its exfiltration capabilities.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
