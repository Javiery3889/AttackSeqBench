### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Sayad malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Communicating with a C2 server at 107.6.182.179.
     2. Performing discovery activities such as collecting running processes.
     3. Collecting keystrokes, clipboard contents, browser bookmarks and cookies, and other sensitive data.
     4. Exfiltrating the collected data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will collect sensitive data only after performing discovery activities.
     - This aligns with a common attack pattern where malware first gathers information about the environment (discovery) before exfiltrating data. This helps the malware understand what data is available and how to collect it efficiently.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will collect sensitive data without performing discovery activities.
     - This is less likely because performing discovery activities helps the malware identify the most valuable data to exfiltrate and ensures that the data collection process is more targeted and effective.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - Malware often follows a structured sequence of operations to maximize its effectiveness and minimize detection.
     - The sequence described in the question (communicating with C2, performing discovery, collecting data, and exfiltrating) is a logical and common approach.
     - Discovery activities are crucial for understanding the environment and identifying valuable data, which makes it more likely that the malware will perform these activities before collecting and exfiltrating data.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - Based on the logical sequence of operations and the importance of discovery activities in malware operations, the most plausible answer is that the malware will collect sensitive data only after performing discovery activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
