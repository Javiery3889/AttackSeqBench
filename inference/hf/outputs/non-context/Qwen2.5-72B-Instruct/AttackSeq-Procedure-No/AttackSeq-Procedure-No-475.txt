### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Chisel malware impacts the system by replacing the legitimate `netd` service.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Chisel Malware:**
     - Chisel is a tool designed for tunneling network traffic over SSH. It is often used to bypass network restrictions and can be used for various purposes, including data exfiltration.
   - **Replacing `netd` Service:**
     - Replacing a legitimate service like `netd` is a common tactic used by malware to maintain persistence and hide its presence.
   - **Exfiltration Using Tor and SSH:**
     - Tor is a network designed to provide anonymity and can be used to hide the origin of data exfiltration.
     - SSH is a secure protocol used for remote access and can be used to tunnel data.
   - **Regular Intervals:**
     - Malware often exfiltrates data at regular intervals to avoid detection and ensure continuous data theft.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Persistence and Stealth:**
     - Replacing a legitimate service (like `netd`) is a method to ensure the malware remains on the system and is less likely to be detected.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Using Tor and SSH for exfiltration is a sophisticated method that can help the attacker maintain anonymity and secure the data transfer.
   - **Regular Intervals:**
     - Exfiltrating data at regular intervals is a common tactic to ensure continuous data theft and to avoid raising immediate suspicion.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the Chisel malware and the methods described (replacing a legitimate service, using Tor and SSH for exfiltration, and exfiltrating at regular intervals), it is plausible that the malware would perform these actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
