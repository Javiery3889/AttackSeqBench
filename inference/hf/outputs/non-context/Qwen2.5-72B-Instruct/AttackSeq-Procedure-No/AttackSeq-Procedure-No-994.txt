### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PROMETHIUM malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Collection Phase:** PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** The question asks if it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 (Command and Control) server every 10 minutes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - PROMETHIUM is known to collect specific types of files, such as Microsoft Office documents, and compress them into archives. This is a common technique to reduce the size of the data being exfiltrated and to make the exfiltration process more efficient.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring the collected data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
     - The frequency of exfiltration can vary based on the attacker's goals and the capabilities of the malware. Exfiltrating data every 10 minutes is relatively frequent and could be suspicious and more likely to be detected by network monitoring tools.
     - Typically, malware might exfiltrate data at less frequent intervals to avoid detection, or it might use more sophisticated methods to blend in with normal network traffic.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is possible for malware to exfiltrate data every 10 minutes, it is not the most common or stealthy approach. Frequent exfiltration can increase the risk of detection and may not be necessary if the data is not time-sensitive.
   - Given the context of the question and the typical behavior of sophisticated malware, it is less likely that PROMETHIUM would exfiltrate data every 10 minutes.

### Final Answer:
B: No
