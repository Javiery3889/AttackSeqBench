### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CopyKittens group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing DNS Command and Control (C2) communication.
     - Constructing unique DNS queries with obfuscated data.
   - The question asks whether the group will exfiltrate victim data using applications such as Rclone as part of their attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the CopyKittens group will use applications like Rclone to exfiltrate data after establishing DNS C2 communication.
     - Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage, which can be used for data exfiltration.
     - It is plausible that after establishing C2 communication, the group would use tools like Rclone to exfiltrate data, as this is a common technique in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the CopyKittens group will not use applications like Rclone to exfiltrate data.
     - This would imply that the group has other methods for data exfiltration or does not exfiltrate data at all, which is less likely given the sophistication of the group and the established C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the CopyKittens group will use applications like Rclone to exfiltrate data after establishing DNS C2 communication.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
