### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
     - VBScript downloading and opening a .doc file.
     - Execution of the malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
     - Cron jobs are typically used in Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) to schedule tasks.
     - However, the sequence described involves a Windows environment (VBScript, .doc file), which is more likely to use Windows-specific tools for persistence and further execution.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
     - Instead, it is more likely to use Windows-specific tools, such as PowerShell, for further execution and persistence.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell in Windows, commonly used by malware for various tasks, including persistence and command execution.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial infection vector and subsequent actions (VBScript, .doc file) are Windows-specific, it is more plausible that the malware will use Windows tools like PowerShell for further execution and persistence.
   - Using a cron job, which is a Unix-specific utility, would be less likely in a Windows environment.

### Final Answer: B: No
