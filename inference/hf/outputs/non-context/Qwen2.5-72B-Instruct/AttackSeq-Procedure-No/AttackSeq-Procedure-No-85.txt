### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by Vyveva's backdoor.
   - The sequence includes compressing files with zlib for transmission to the C&C server.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will collect files from the computer only after obtaining system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will collect files only after obtaining system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the backdoor will not necessarily collect files only after obtaining system information.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Typical Malware Behavior:**
     - Malware often collects system information first to understand the environment it is operating in. This information can be used to determine the best course of action, such as which files to target, whether to proceed with the infection, or how to avoid detection.
     - Collecting system information is a common initial step in many malware operations.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question mentions compressing files with zlib for transmission to the C&C server. This implies that the backdoor has already identified and collected the files to be compressed.
     - If the backdoor collects files only after obtaining system information, it would make sense that the system information is gathered first to inform the file collection process.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is logical for the backdoor to gather system information first, then decide which files to collect, and finally compress and transmit those files to the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
