### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elfin threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying DarkComet (a Remote Access Trojan, RAT).
     - Using a credential dumping tool to extract credentials.
     - Bypassing logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands.
     - Proceeding with command and control (C2) communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deploying DarkComet:**
     - DarkComet is a well-known RAT that can be used for various malicious activities, including credential theft and remote control of the infected machine.
   - **Using a Credential Dumping Tool:**
     - Credential dumping is a common technique used to extract credentials from the infected machine, which can be used for further lateral movement or to gain higher privileges.
   - **Bypassing Logging:**
     - Bypassing logging is a technique used to avoid detection by security systems. This can be done using various methods, including PowerShell commands to manipulate or disable logging mechanisms.
   - **Command and Control Communications:**
     - Tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are used for maintaining persistent control over the infected machine and communicating with the attacker's command and control server.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     - **Initial Infection and RAT Deployment:** Deploying DarkComet to gain initial access.
     - **Credential Dumping:** Extracting credentials to escalate privileges or move laterally.
     - **Bypassing Logging:** Avoiding detection by security systems.
     - **C2 Communications:** Establishing and maintaining control over the infected machine.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of an attack. Bypassing logging is a common step to avoid detection, and it makes sense to do this before establishing C2 communications to ensure the attacker's actions are not logged and detected.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
