### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Disguising executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names.
     - Using `verclsid.exe` to download and execute a malicious script.
     - Utilizing command-and-control (C2) infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Disguising Executable Malware Files:**
     - This is a common technique used to trick users into executing malware. Attackers often rename malware files to look like legitimate documents (e.g., `.doc`, `.pdf`) to avoid suspicion.
   - **Using `verclsid.exe`:**
     - `verclsid.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to verify the class identifier (CLSID) of a file. However, it can be abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts. This is a known technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism" and "Trusted Developer Utilities" tactics.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Infrastructure:**
     - Using C2 infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services is a common method for attackers to maintain communication with compromised systems. DynDNS services allow attackers to use domain names that resolve to different IP addresses, making it harder to block or track the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - Disguising malware files is a common initial infection vector.
     - Using `verclsid.exe` to execute a malicious script is a known technique for evading detection and executing payloads.
     - Utilizing C2 infrastructure with dynamic and static IPs on DynDNS services is a common method for maintaining control over compromised systems and evading network defenses.

### Final Answer:
