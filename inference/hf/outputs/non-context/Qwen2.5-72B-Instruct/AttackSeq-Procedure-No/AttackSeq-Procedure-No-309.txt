### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of events in a Cobalt Strike attack.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether the C2 server responds with an HTTP 200 OK to deliver `beacon.dll` only after generating raw malicious payloads in various formats.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Step 1:** The attacker uses `beacon.dll` to control an infected host.
   - **Step 2:** The C2 server responds with an HTTP 200 OK to deliver `beacon.dll`.
   - **Step 3:** The C2 server generates raw malicious payloads in various formats for implementation and staging during execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1:** The use of `beacon.dll` to control an infected host implies that the host is already compromised and the beacon is active.
   - **Step 2:** The C2 server responding with an HTTP 200 OK to deliver `beacon.dll` suggests that the beacon is being delivered to the host. However, if the host is already compromised and the beacon is active, this step is redundant.
   - **Step 3:** Generating raw malicious payloads in various formats is a common post-compromise activity, but it typically happens after the beacon is already active and the C2 server has established communication with the infected host.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not logical because the C2 server would not need to deliver `beacon.dll` to an already compromised host that is already using `beacon.dll` to communicate with the C2 server.
   - The generation of raw malicious payloads is a post-compromise activity and does not need to precede the delivery of `beacon.dll` to an already compromised host.

### Final Answer:
B: No
