### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor NanHaiShu.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gathering system information (IP Address, Volume Serial Number, Computer Name).
     - Creating SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts.
     - Downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Threat actors often gather system information to understand the environment they are operating in and to plan further actions.
   - **Creating SOCK5 and Custom Protocol Proxies:**
     - Proxies, especially SOCK5 proxies, are often used to route traffic through infected hosts to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or to mask the origin of the attacker's commands.
     - Custom protocols can be used to evade detection and to establish a more secure and stealthy communication channel.
   - **Downloading and Executing JScript and VBScript Code:**
     - Downloading and executing scripts is a common technique for further compromising a system, such as downloading additional malware, executing commands, or establishing persistence.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known TTPs of advanced threat actors.
   - Gathering system information is a typical first step to understand the environment.
   - Creating proxies is a common next step to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
   - Downloading and executing scripts is a common final step to achieve the attacker's objectives.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and the alignment with known TTPs, the most plausible answer is that NanHaiShu is likely to follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
