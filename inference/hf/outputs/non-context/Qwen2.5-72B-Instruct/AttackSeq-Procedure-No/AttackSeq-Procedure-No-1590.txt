### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial discovery phase where the threat actor, Earth Lusca, uses scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and specific commands to scan a range of IP addresses for open ports (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443).
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will use pass the ticket (PtT) methods for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The use of scanning tools and commands to identify open ports is a common initial step in the discovery phase of an attack. This helps the attacker understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Pass the ticket (PtT) is a technique used for lateral movement within a network. It involves using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate to other systems without needing to know the password.
   - **Context of Earth Lusca:**
     - Earth Lusca is a known threat actor that has been associated with sophisticated attacks, often involving multiple stages and techniques. They are known to use a variety of methods for lateral movement, including PtT.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Scanning:**
     - The scanning of specific ports (445, 3389, 1433, 3306, 80, 443) suggests that the attacker is looking for common services and protocols that could be exploited. For example, port 445 is associated with SMB (Server Message Block), which is often used in PtT attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Given that Earth Lusca is a sophisticated threat actor, it is plausible that they would use advanced techniques like PtT for lateral movement. PtT is a common method for moving laterally in a Windows environment, especially after gaining initial access and identifying potential targets.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence of TTPs (scanning followed by lateral movement) is consistent with the behavior of advanced threat actors like Earth Lusca. After identifying potential targets, it is logical to use PtT to move laterally and gain access to other systems.
