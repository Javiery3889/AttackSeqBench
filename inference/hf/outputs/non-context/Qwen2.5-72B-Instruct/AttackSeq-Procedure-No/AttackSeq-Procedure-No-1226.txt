### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - The question then asks whether T9000 (presumably a malware or threat actor) is likely to access the victim’s webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - Modifying registry keys and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe are common techniques used to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts or the user logs in. This is a typical persistence mechanism.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Accessing the webcam and recording video is a form of data collection. Malware often includes various data collection capabilities to gather sensitive information, monitor user activities, or exfiltrate data.
   - **T9000:**
     - T9000 is not a well-known malware or threat actor name, but based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that it is a sophisticated piece of malware with multiple capabilities.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the malware has already established persistence and is running in the context of explorer.exe, it is plausible that it would have the capability and intent to access the webcam and record video. This is a common behavior for advanced malware, especially those designed for espionage or surveillance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the established persistence and the typical behavior of advanced malware, it is likely that T9000 would access the victim’s webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
