### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Seaduke malware.
   - The actions include retrieving detailed bot/system information and securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Seaduke will calculate the command-and-control (C2) port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Seaduke Malware:**
     - Seaduke is a sophisticated malware known for its use in targeted attacks.
     - It is capable of performing various actions, including information gathering and self-destruction.
   - **Seppuku Function:**
     - The 'seppuku' function is a self-destruction mechanism that securely deletes the malware from the infected system.
   - **C2 Port Calculation:**
     - The question asks about a specific method for calculating the C2 port.
     - This method involves multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While Seaduke is known for its sophisticated capabilities, the specific method of calculating the C2 port as described is not a commonly known or documented feature of Seaduke.
     - Malware often uses more straightforward or less predictable methods for C2 communication to avoid detection and analysis.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the described method for calculating the C2 port is not a known or likely feature of Seaduke.

**Final Answer: B: No**
