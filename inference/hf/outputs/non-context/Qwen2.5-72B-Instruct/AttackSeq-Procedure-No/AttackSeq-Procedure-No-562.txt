### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have identified the geographical location of a victim host before using T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1012 (Query Registry) as part of their Discovery activities.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - T1057: Process Discovery
     - T1012: Query Registry

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1057 (Process Discovery):** This technique involves the attacker identifying running processes on a system to understand what is currently active and potentially to identify processes that could be targeted for further exploitation.
   - **T1012 (Query Registry):** This technique involves the attacker querying the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, such as installed software, user accounts, and system configurations.
   - **Geographical Location Identification:** This involves determining the physical location of the victim host, which is not a standard part of the Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It is more likely to be part of the Initial Access or Reconnaissance phases.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The SolarWinds attackers are known for their sophisticated and methodical approach. They typically follow a well-structured attack lifecycle.
   - In the context of the SolarWinds attack, the initial compromise was achieved through a supply chain attack, where the attackers injected malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software updates.
   - Once the initial compromise was achieved, the attackers would likely focus on understanding the compromised environment to move laterally and achieve their objectives.
   - The Discovery phase, which includes T1057 and T1012, is crucial for the attackers to understand the system they have compromised. This phase typically follows the initial access and is focused on gathering information about the system and network.
   - Identifying the geographical location of a victim host is not a standard part of the Discovery phase and is more likely to be done during the Reconnaissance phase, which occurs before the initial compromise.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the structured and methodical nature of the SolarWinds attack, it is more likely that the attackers would have identified the geographical location of the victim host during the Reconnaissance phase, not immediately before the Discovery phase activities like T1057 and T1012.

### Final Answer: B: No
