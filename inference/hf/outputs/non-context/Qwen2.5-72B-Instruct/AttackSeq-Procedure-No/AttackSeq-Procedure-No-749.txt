### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - It used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Data Exfiltration:**
     - The implant has already performed reconnaissance and collected system and network details.
     - It has used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to exfiltrate data to the control server.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - The question asks if the implant would use HTTP POST requests for communication.
     - It specifies that the communication would be encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - **Consistency in TTPs:**
     - The use of RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration suggests that the implant has a consistent method of encoding and encrypting data.
     - It is logical to assume that the same methods would be used for communication with the control server to maintain consistency and avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the consistent use of RC4 and Base64 for data exfiltration, it is highly likely that the implant would use the same methods for communication with the control server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
