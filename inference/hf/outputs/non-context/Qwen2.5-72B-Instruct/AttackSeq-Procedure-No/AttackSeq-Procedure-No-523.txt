### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a PowerShell script named 'fmx.ps1' will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload and then decode and execute a base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved by delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. This is a common technique used by attackers to bypass email filters and trick users into opening the document.
   - **PowerShell Script ('fmx.ps1'):**
     - The next step involves a PowerShell script named 'fmx.ps1'. PowerShell is often used in post-exploitation activities due to its powerful capabilities and the fact that it is natively available on most Windows systems.
   - **Downloading a ZIP File:**
     - It is common for malware to download additional components after initial access. This can include additional payloads, configuration files, or other resources needed for the attack.
   - **Decoding and Executing a Base64 Encoded Script:**
     - Base64 encoding is frequently used to obfuscate malicious scripts and evade detection. The script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' (which is likely a file with a .jpg extension but containing a base64 encoded script) would be decoded and executed by the PowerShell script.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns. The initial access through a malicious document, followed by the use of a PowerShell script to download additional components and execute a base64 encoded script, is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer:
