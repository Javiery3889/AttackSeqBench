### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the Adwind RAT (Remote Access Trojan) and a compromised Westnet user account.
   - The victim executes multi-layer JAR (Java Archive) extractions.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the RAT will use port-knocking to authenticate itself to another implant called Cryshell before configuring its command and control (C2) connection through the JRAT class.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Adwind RAT is hosted on a compromised Westnet user account.
     - The victim executes multi-layer JAR extractions, which is a common technique used by RATs to obfuscate and deliver the payload.
   - **Port-Knocking:**
     - Port-knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports.
     - It is typically used to hide services from unauthorized access and is not a common technique used by RATs for authentication.
   - **Cryshell Implant:**
     - The question mentions another implant called Cryshell, but it does not provide details on its function or how it interacts with the Adwind RAT.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Configuration:**
     - The JRAT class is mentioned as the method for configuring the C2 connection.
     - JRAT is a known component of the Adwind RAT, responsible for establishing and maintaining the C2 connection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Port-Knocking and RATs:**
     - While port-knocking can be used for stealth and security, it is not a typical method for RATs to authenticate with other implants or to configure C2 connections.
     - RATs generally use more straightforward methods for C2 communication, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or custom protocols.
   - **Cryshell and JRAT:**
     - The question does not provide enough information to determine the relationship between the Adwind RAT and the Cryshell implant.
     - However, the JRAT class is a known component of the Adwind RAT, and it is more likely that the RAT would use this class to configure its C2 connection directly.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, it is not likely that the Adwind RAT will use port-knocking to authenticate itself to another implant called Cryshell before configuring its C2 connection through the JRAT class.

**Final Answer: B: No**
