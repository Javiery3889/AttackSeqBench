### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group BRONZE PRESIDENT.
   - The sequence includes the use of Wmiexec for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group will use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment only after elevating privileges and installing malware on systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Wmiexec for Lateral Movement:**
     - Wmiexec is a tool that allows attackers to execute commands on remote systems using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This is a common technique for lateral movement in a network.
   - **Elevating Privileges:**
     - Elevating privileges is a critical step in an attack sequence where the attacker gains higher-level access to a system, often to perform more advanced actions.
   - **Installing Malware:**
     - Installing malware is typically done after gaining sufficient privileges to ensure the malware can operate effectively and persist on the system.
   - **Using Nmap and Ping:**
     - Nmap and ping are network scanning tools used to discover and map network environments. These tools are often used early in the attack lifecycle to gather information about the network and identify potential targets.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Network Scanning (Nmap and Ping):**
     - Network scanning is typically one of the first steps in an attack sequence. It helps the attacker understand the network topology, identify active hosts, and determine which systems might be vulnerable.
   - **Lateral Movement (Wmiexec):**
     - Lateral movement is a subsequent step, where the attacker uses the information gathered from network scanning to move from one system to another.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is often performed on a target system after the attacker has gained initial access, either through lateral movement or other means.
   - **Malware Installation:**
     - Malware installation is typically done after the attacker has elevated privileges to ensure the malware can operate with the necessary permissions.

   Given this sequence, it is unlikely that the group would use Nmap and ping only after elevating privileges and installing malware. Network scanning is a foundational step that is usually performed early in the attack to gather the necessary information for subsequent actions.

### Final Answer: B: No
