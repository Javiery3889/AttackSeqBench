### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **System Fingerprinting for Discovery:** The attacker performs detailed system fingerprinting to gather information about the target.
     2. **Following Guidelines to Avoid Detection:** The attacker adheres to guidelines from the Vault 7 documents to avoid detection.
     3. **Gaining Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document.
     4. **Infecting with Plexor Malware:** The attacker infects the target with Plexor malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting for Discovery:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the target environment.
   - **Following Guidelines to Avoid Detection:** The Vault 7 documents are known to contain techniques used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to avoid detection. However, these guidelines are typically followed throughout the attack, not just before gaining initial access.
   - **Gaining Initial Access:** Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document is a plausible method for gaining initial access.
   - **Infecting with Plexor Malware:** Plexor is a known piece of malware, and it is reasonable that it could be used after gaining initial access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely logical. Typically, an attacker would follow guidelines to avoid detection throughout the entire attack, not just before gaining initial access.
   - The sequence suggests that the attacker only follows the Vault 7 guidelines before gaining initial access, which is unlikely. Once the attacker has gained initial access, they would still need to avoid detection to maintain persistence and achieve their objectives.
   - Therefore, the sequence as described is not the most plausible.
