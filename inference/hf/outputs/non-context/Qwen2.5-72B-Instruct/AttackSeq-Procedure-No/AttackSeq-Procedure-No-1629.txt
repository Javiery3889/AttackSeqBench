### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access:** Obtaining access to the victim's network through compromised remote services (e.g., VPN, Citrix).
     2. **Persistence:** Achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes (e.g., servers).
     3. **Execution:** Using scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Compromising remote services like VPN or Citrix is a common initial access technique (T1133: External Remote Services).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Targeting systems with high uptimes (e.g., servers) for persistence is a logical step. Servers are often critical and have high availability, making them ideal for maintaining long-term access (T1098: Account Manipulation, T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer, T1136: Create Account).
   - **Execution:**
     - Using scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory is a plausible technique for maintaining persistence and ensuring the beacon is reloaded after system reboots (T1053: Scheduled Task/Job).

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is likely.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is not likely.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common sequence of TTPs used by adversaries. After gaining initial access, achieving persistence on high-uptime systems, and using scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory is a well-documented and effective method for maintaining long-term access to a network.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
