### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Dexphot using process hollowing after employing fileless techniques for defense evasion.
   - Key TTPs mentioned: Fileless techniques, process hollowing.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fileless Techniques:** These are methods used by malware to avoid detection by operating in memory and without writing files to the disk. This is a common technique for initial infection and persistence.
   - **Process Hollowing:** This is a technique where a legitimate process is created in a suspended state, its memory is replaced with malicious code, and then the process is resumed. This is often used to execute malware in the context of a trusted process, further evading detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Dexphot Malware:**
     - Dexphot is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, including fileless execution and process injection.
     - Fileless techniques are often used to establish an initial foothold and avoid detection.
     - Process hollowing is a common follow-up technique to execute malicious code in the context of a legitimate process, which aligns with Dexphot's goal of evading detection and maintaining persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that Dexphot is known for its advanced evasion techniques and the logical progression from fileless execution to process hollowing, it is highly plausible that Dexphot would use process hollowing after employing fileless techniques.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
