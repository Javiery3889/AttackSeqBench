### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with gaining initial access through opportunistic phishing emails.
   - The attackers then create backdoors on compromised systems.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser before executing malicious payloads, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:** This is a common initial access technique (T1566) in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Creating Backdoors:** Once initial access is gained, attackers often create backdoors (T1502) to maintain persistence.
   - **Using AppleScript to Inject Malicious JavaScript:**
     - AppleScript is a scripting language used on macOS to automate tasks.
     - Injecting malicious JavaScript into a browser using AppleScript is a plausible technique, as AppleScript can interact with applications, including web browsers.
   - **Executing Malicious Payloads:**
     - After gaining a foothold and maintaining persistence, attackers typically execute additional malicious payloads (T1059).
     - The installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool is a specific payload that could be part of the attacker's objectives, such as monitoring employee activities.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with common attack patterns.
   - The use of AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser is a plausible step in the attack chain, especially on macOS systems.
   - The installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool as a payload fits the context of an attacker's objectives.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
