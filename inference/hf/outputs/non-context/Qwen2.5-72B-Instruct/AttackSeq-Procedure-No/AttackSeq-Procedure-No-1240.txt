### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Scanning IP ranges to discover vulnerable systems.
     - Reporting results to a centralized server.
     - Using DNS tunneling for command and control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning IP ranges to discover vulnerable systems:**
     - This is a common initial reconnaissance technique used by many APT groups, including APT28, to identify potential targets.
   - **Reporting results to a centralized server:**
     - Once vulnerabilities are identified, the results are often reported back to a centralized server for further analysis and planning.
   - **Using DNS tunneling for command and control (C2) communication:**
     - DNS tunneling is a technique where attackers use the DNS protocol to communicate with C2 servers. This can be used to exfiltrate data or receive commands from the attacker.
     - APT28 is known to use various C2 techniques, including DNS tunneling, to maintain stealth and evade detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - APT28 is a sophisticated threat actor known for using a variety of advanced techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - DNS tunneling is a technique that aligns with APT28's known capabilities and is often used in scenarios where traditional C2 channels might be monitored or blocked.
   - Given the sophistication of APT28, it is plausible that they would use DNS tunneling for C2 communication after discovering and reporting vulnerable systems.

### Final Answer:
