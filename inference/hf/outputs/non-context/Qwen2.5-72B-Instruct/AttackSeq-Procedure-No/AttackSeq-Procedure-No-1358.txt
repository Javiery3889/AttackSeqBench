### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the TAIDOOR loader decrypts and executes RAT (Remote Access Trojan) files in memory.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware will establish command and control (C2) by leveraging social networking sites and cloud platforms like Twitter, Dropbox, and Mediafire.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TAIDOOR Loader and RAT Execution:**
     - TAIDOOR is a known loader used by threat actors to deliver and execute other malware, such as RATs, in memory. This is a common technique to avoid detection by traditional security solutions.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - Malware often needs to communicate with a C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Using social networking sites and cloud platforms for C2 is a known technique to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Social Networking Sites and Cloud Platforms:**
     - Platforms like Twitter, Dropbox, and Mediafire are commonly used for C2 because they are widely trusted and less likely to be blocked by network security measures. Malware can use these platforms to post or retrieve commands and data in a way that mimics normal user behavior.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the nature of TAIDOOR and the common use of social networking sites and cloud platforms for C2, it is plausible that the malware would leverage these platforms to establish and maintain C2 communication.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
