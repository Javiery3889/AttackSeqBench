### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes deploying malware components such as small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence by replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Darkhotel APT Group:**
     - Darkhotel is known for targeting high-profile individuals, particularly in the hospitality and business sectors.
     - They often use sophisticated techniques to gain initial access and maintain persistence.
   - **Persistence Techniques:**
     - Replacing system files like `pam_unix.so` is a known technique for maintaining persistence, but it is relatively uncommon and can be easily detected by security tools.
     - Darkhotel APT is known to use more sophisticated and stealthy methods to maintain persistence, such as:
       - **Registry Run Keys/Items:** Adding entries to the Windows Registry to ensure their malware runs at system startup.
       - **Scheduled Tasks:** Creating scheduled tasks to execute their malware periodically.
       - **Service Creation:** Creating or modifying system services to run their malware.
       - **DLL Hijacking:** Placing malicious DLLs in paths that are searched before legitimate DLLs.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While replacing `pam_unix.so` is a valid persistence technique, it is more commonly associated with Linux systems and is not a typical method used by Darkhotel APT, which primarily targets Windows systems.
     - Darkhotel APT is known for using more sophisticated and less detectable methods to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT group and the less common nature of replacing `pam_unix.so` for persistence, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
