### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of a modular malware framework (GreyEnergy) during the resource development phase.
   - The question then asks whether GreyEnergy will interact with Office 365 tenants to gather details regarding the target's environments.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - GreyEnergy is known for its sophisticated and modular nature, which allows it to perform a wide range of activities, including reconnaissance and data gathering.
     - Interacting with Office 365 tenants to gather details about the target's environment is a plausible step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. This could involve gathering information about user accounts, organizational structure, and other relevant details.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that GreyEnergy does not interact with Office 365 tenants to gather details about the target's environment.
     - While it is possible that GreyEnergy might not always interact with Office 365, the modular nature of the malware and its known capabilities make it likely that it would use such interactions to gather valuable information.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - GreyEnergy is a sophisticated malware framework known for its modular design, which allows it to adapt to different environments and perform various tasks.
   - The resource development phase often involves gathering detailed information about the target environment to tailor the attack.
   - Interacting with Office 365 tenants to gather details about the target's environment is a logical step in the reconnaissance phase, as it can provide valuable information about the target's infrastructure and users.
   - Given the capabilities and known behavior of GreyEnergy, it is highly plausible that it would interact with Office 365 tenants to gather such details.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
