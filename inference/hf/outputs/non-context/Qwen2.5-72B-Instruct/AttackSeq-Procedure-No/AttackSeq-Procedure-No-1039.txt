### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
   - The attackers then write a script to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and use a run key in the registry to establish persistence.
   - Finally, the question asks if it is likely that the attackers will establish persistence before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 is a known method for gaining initial access to a system. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Writing a script to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry are common techniques for establishing persistence. The run key ensures that the script is executed every time the system starts.
   - **Deployment of POWERSHOWER:**
     - POWERSHOWER is a PowerShell-based backdoor that can be used for various malicious activities, such as command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is logical for attackers to establish persistence to ensure they maintain control over the compromised system even if the initial exploit vector is closed or the system is rebooted.
     - Establishing persistence is a critical step before deploying more sophisticated malware like POWERSHOWER, as it ensures that the attackers can return to the system and continue their operations.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The described sequence (initial access → persistence → deployment of POWERSHOWER) is a common and logical sequence in many attack scenarios. It aligns with the typical TTPs used by advanced threat actors.
