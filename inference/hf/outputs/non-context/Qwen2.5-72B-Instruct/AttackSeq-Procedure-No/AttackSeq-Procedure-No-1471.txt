### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where adversaries have already established a Command and Control (C2) connection through the execution of a malicious VBA script.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C2 Connection:**
     - The initial step of establishing a C2 connection through a malicious VBA script indicates that the attackers have already gained a foothold in the target environment.
   - **Phishing Campaign:**
     - A phishing campaign is typically used as an initial access vector to deliver malware or to gain initial foothold in a target environment.
     - Given that the attackers have already established a C2 connection, they have already achieved initial access and have a way to communicate with the compromised system.
   - **Delivering BlackEnergy 3 RAT:**
     - BlackEnergy 3 is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that can be used for various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, command execution, and lateral movement.
     - Once a C2 connection is established, attackers can use this connection to deploy additional malware, such as BlackEnergy 3, directly to the compromised system without the need for a phishing campaign.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Since the attackers have already established a C2 connection, they have a direct channel to the compromised system. They can use this channel to deploy additional malware, such as BlackEnergy 3, without the need for a phishing campaign.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems after they have already established a C2 connection.

### Final Answer: B: No
