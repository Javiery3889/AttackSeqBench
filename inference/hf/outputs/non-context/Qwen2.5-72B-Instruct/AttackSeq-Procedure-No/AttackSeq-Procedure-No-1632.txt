### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary has already compressed and encrypted large chunks of data and is preparing to exfiltrate them.
   - The specific question is whether the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Dividing files into smaller chunks before exfiltration is a common technique used by adversaries to avoid detection. Large files can be more easily noticed by network monitoring tools, and smaller files can be exfiltrated more discreetly.
     - This technique is often used to bypass size limitations or to make the exfiltration process less conspicuous.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the adversary does not divide the files, they risk being detected by network monitoring tools that flag large data transfers.
     - However, if the adversary is confident that the large file transfer will not be detected or if the exfiltration channel is secure, they might choose not to divide the files.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the adversary has already compressed and encrypted the data, they are likely taking steps to avoid detection. Dividing the files into smaller chunks is a logical next step to further reduce the risk of detection.
   - Additionally, many exfiltration channels, including those used to collect data from information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online, may have size limitations or monitoring in place that could flag large file transfers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
