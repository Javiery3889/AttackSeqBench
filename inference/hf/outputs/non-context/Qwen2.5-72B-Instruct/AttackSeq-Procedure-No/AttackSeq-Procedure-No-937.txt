### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Gaining initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
     2. Compromising trusted commercial network resources to support their operations.
     3. Performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Darkhotel APT is known for using social engineering and spear-phishing attacks to deliver malware. One of their common techniques is to disguise malware as legitimate software updates, which aligns with the first step in the question.
   - **Compromising Trusted Commercial Network Resources:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for APT groups to compromise trusted network resources to maintain persistence and support their operations. This step is logical and aligns with the second part of the question.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Once the APT group has a foothold in the network, they typically perform reconnaissance to gather detailed information about the victim's environment, including travel plans and other sensitive data. This aligns with the third part of the question.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a typical APT attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access** (via malware disguised as legitimate software updates).
     2. **Compromise Trusted Resources** (to maintain persistence and support operations).
     3. **Reconnaissance** (to gather detailed information about the victim).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and the known TTPs of the Darkhotel APT, the answer is that it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
