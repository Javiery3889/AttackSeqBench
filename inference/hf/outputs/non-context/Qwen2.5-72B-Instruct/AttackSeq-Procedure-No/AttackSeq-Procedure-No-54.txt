### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Responder tool to achieve credential access.
   - The next step in the sequence is Wi-Fi discovery to collect names and passwords of all Wi-Fi networks to which a device has previously connected.
   - The final step is using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Responder Tool for Credential Access:**
     - The Responder tool is commonly used to capture NetNTLMv2 hashes and other credentials by setting up a rogue server that responds to LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) requests. This is a well-known technique for credential access.
   - **Wi-Fi Discovery:**
     - Wi-Fi discovery involves collecting information about Wi-Fi networks to which a device has previously connected. This is typically done to gain access to additional networks or to gather more credentials. However, it is not a common next step after credential access in a typical attack sequence.
   - **Lateral Movement with Windows Commands and WMIC:**
     - Lateral movement is a common next step after gaining initial access and credentials. Using Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts is a standard technique for spreading within a network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of the Responder tool to gain credential access is a logical first step.
   - However, performing Wi-Fi discovery after gaining credentials is not a typical next step. Wi-Fi discovery is more relevant in scenarios where the attacker is looking to gain access to additional networks or to gather more credentials, but it is not a common part of the lateral movement process.
   - Lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC is a logical and common next step after gaining credentials.

### Final Answer:
B: No
