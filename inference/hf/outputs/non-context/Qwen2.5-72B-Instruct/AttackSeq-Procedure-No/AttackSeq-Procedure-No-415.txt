### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of UNC1945 using a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Executing the STEELCORGI ELF packer in memory for log obfuscation.
     - Escalating privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and other tools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **STEELCORGI ELF Packer:**
     - STEELCORGI is a known packer used by UNC1945 to obfuscate and protect their malware. It is often used to evade detection and forensic analysis.
   - **Log Obfuscation:**
     - Executing the packer in memory can help in log obfuscation by making it harder to trace the execution of the malware.
   - **SLAPSTICK Backdoor:**
     - SLAPSTICK is a backdoor used by UNC1945 to maintain persistence and escalate privileges on compromised systems.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described (log obfuscation followed by privilege escalation) is a logical and common approach in cyber attacks. Attackers often use anti-forensic techniques to cover their tracks before performing more sensitive operations like privilege escalation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of UNC1945 and the logical sequence of actions (log obfuscation followed by privilege escalation), it is likely that UNC1945 employed these techniques.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
