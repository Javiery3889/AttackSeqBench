### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is achieved through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the DNSpionage malware will maintain persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' only before requiring human interaction to execute payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - This is a common initial access technique (T1566) where attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to gain a foothold in the victim's network.
   - **Persistence via Scheduled Task:**
     - Creating a scheduled task (T1053) is a common technique used by malware to maintain persistence. The task is set to run at regular intervals or at system startup, ensuring the malware remains active.
   - **Scheduled Task Name:**
     - The name 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' is likely chosen to appear legitimate and blend in with other system processes, making it less suspicious to the user or system administrators.
   - **Human Interaction to Execute Payloads:**
     - This part of the question suggests that the malware requires human interaction to execute payloads. This is less common in automated persistence mechanisms, which typically aim to run without user intervention.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Creating a scheduled task is a typical method for maintaining persistence. The name 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' is a plausible choice to avoid detection.
   - **Human Interaction:**
     - Requiring human interaction to execute payloads is less common in persistence mechanisms. Once a scheduled task is created, it is designed to run automatically. Requiring human interaction would defeat the purpose of maintaining persistence without user intervention.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, it is unlikely that the DNSpionage malware would require human interaction to execute payloads after creating a scheduled task for persistence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
