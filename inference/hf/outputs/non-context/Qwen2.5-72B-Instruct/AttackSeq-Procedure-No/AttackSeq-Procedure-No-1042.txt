### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the POWERSHOWER malware.
   - The sequence includes collecting system information and sending it to a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that POWERSHOWER will use external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, to maintain Command and Control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - External proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints, are a common method used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to obfuscate their command and control (C2) infrastructure.
     - This technique helps in evading detection and attribution by making it harder to trace the origin of the C2 traffic.
     - POWERSHOWER, being a sophisticated malware, is likely to use such techniques to maintain a persistent and stealthy presence in the network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that POWERSHOWER does not use external proxy techniques to maintain C2.
     - However, given the sophistication of POWERSHOWER and the common use of such techniques in APT operations, this answer is less likely.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs for POWERSHOWER includes the use of external proxy techniques to maintain Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
