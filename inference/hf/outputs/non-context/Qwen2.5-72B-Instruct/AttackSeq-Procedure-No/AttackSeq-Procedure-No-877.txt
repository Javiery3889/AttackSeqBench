### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Naikon APT group.
   - The sequence involves the use of the Aria-body backdoor for gathering detailed system and network information during the Discovery tactic.
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:** The Discovery tactic is used to gather information about the system and network. This is typically done after initial access to the target system.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic, which typically follows the Discovery phase.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** The logical sequence of TTPs in a typical attack would be:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Discovery
     3. Command and Control (C2)
   - **Timing of C2 Communication:** The question suggests that C2 communication (using HTTP and TCP) happens only before the Discovery tactic. This is not logical because C2 communication is typically established after the initial access and discovery phases to maintain control over the compromised system and exfiltrate data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of APT groups, it is not plausible that the Naikon APT group would use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: B: No**
