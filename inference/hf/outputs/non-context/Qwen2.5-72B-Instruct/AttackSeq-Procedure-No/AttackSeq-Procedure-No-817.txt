### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of WinDealer using non-standard ports (UDP 6999 or TCP 55556) for C2 (Command and Control) communication before it steals information from SNS (Social Networking Services) applications and encrypts the data using AES.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that WinDealer is likely to use non-standard ports for C2 communication before stealing and encrypting data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that WinDealer is unlikely to use non-standard ports for C2 communication before stealing and encrypting data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Non-Standard Ports for C2 Communication:**
     - Malware often uses non-standard ports to evade detection by firewalls and network security systems. Using ports like UDP 6999 or TCP 55556 is a common tactic to avoid being blocked by standard security measures.
   - **Stealing Information from SNS Applications:**
     - Once the malware has established a C2 connection, it can receive commands to perform various actions, including stealing information from SNS applications.
   - **Encrypting Data Using AES:**
     - Encrypting stolen data is a common practice to ensure that the data remains confidential during transmission and to prevent it from being intercepted and read by security systems.

4. **Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question (using non-standard ports for C2 communication, stealing information from SNS applications, and encrypting the data) is a plausible and common sequence in malware operations. Malware often uses non-standard ports to establish a C2 connection, then performs its malicious activities, and finally encrypts the data to exfiltrate it securely.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
