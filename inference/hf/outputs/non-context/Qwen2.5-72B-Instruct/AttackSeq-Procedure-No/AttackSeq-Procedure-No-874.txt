### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access.
   - The attacker then uses CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to achieve privilege escalation.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Stager module will encode its C2 (Command and Control) traffic using Base64 before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Privilege Escalation:**
     - The initial access is gained through zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows.
     - Privilege escalation is achieved using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
   - **Stager Module:**
     - A Stager module is typically used to download and execute additional malware components.
     - Encoding C2 traffic using Base64 is a common technique to obfuscate the traffic and avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Dropper Module:**
     - A Dropper module is used to download and execute the final payload or additional malware components.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Base64 Encoding:**
     - Base64 encoding is a simple and effective method to obfuscate data, making it harder for network security tools to detect malicious traffic.
     - It is a common practice in malware to encode C2 traffic to avoid detection.
   - **Stager and Dropper Modules:**
     - The Stager module is often designed to be stealthy and to avoid detection. Encoding C2 traffic is a logical step in this process.
     - The Dropper module, which is downloaded and executed by the Stager, is typically the next stage in the attack sequence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practice of encoding C2 traffic to avoid detection and the logical sequence of using a Stager to download and execute a Dropper, it is likely that the Stager module will encode its C2 traffic using Base64.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
