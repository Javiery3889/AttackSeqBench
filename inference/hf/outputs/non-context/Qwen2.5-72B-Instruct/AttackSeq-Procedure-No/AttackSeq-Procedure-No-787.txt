### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that the Higaisa APT group might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Distributing malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing.
     - Executing a JavaScript file to perform actions such as:
       - Creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe'.
       - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
       - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - To evaluate this, we need to consider the typical behavior of APT groups and the logical flow of the described actions.
     - APT groups often use spear-phishing to deliver initial payloads, such as LNK files, which can then execute additional scripts or binaries.
     - The sequence of actions (executing a JavaScript file, creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request) is a plausible follow-up to the initial spear-phishing attack.
     - These actions align with common post-exploitation techniques, such as establishing persistence and exfiltrating data.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is unlikely.
     - To evaluate this, we need to consider if there are any logical inconsistencies or unusual steps in the sequence.
     - The sequence of actions described is consistent with known APT group behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
     - There are no apparent logical inconsistencies in the sequence.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the typical behavior of APT groups.
   - Spear-phishing is a common initial attack vector, and the subsequent actions (executing a JavaScript file, creating and executing binaries, establishing persistence, and exfiltrating data) are logical follow-up steps.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Higaisa APT group would use this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
