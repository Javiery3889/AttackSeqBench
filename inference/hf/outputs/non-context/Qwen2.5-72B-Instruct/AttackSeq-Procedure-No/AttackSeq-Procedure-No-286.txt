### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Elfin group.
   - The sequence includes establishing command and control (C2) using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Elfin exfiltrated data over Google Drive.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing Command and Control (C2):**
     - POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are both tools used for establishing and maintaining C2. POSHC2 is a PowerShell-based C2 framework, and Quasar RAT is a remote access trojan.
     - These tools are commonly used to gain and maintain access to a compromised system, allowing the attackers to execute commands and control the system remotely.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Once C2 is established, the next logical step in an attack sequence is to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.
     - Google Drive is a cloud storage service that can be used for data exfiltration. It is a common method for attackers to use legitimate cloud services to avoid detection and to blend in with normal network traffic.
   - **Elfin Group's TTPs:**
     - The Elfin group is known for using a variety of tools and techniques to achieve their objectives, including data exfiltration.
     - Using cloud services like Google Drive for data exfiltration is a plausible and common technique used by many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, including Elfin.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the established C2 using POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, and the common use of cloud services like Google Drive for data exfiltration, it is likely that Elfin exfiltrated data over Google Drive.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
