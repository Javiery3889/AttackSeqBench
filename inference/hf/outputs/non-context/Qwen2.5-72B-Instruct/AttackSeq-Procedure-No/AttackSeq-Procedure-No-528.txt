### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dropping Elephant threat actor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks** for initial access.
     - **Steganography** to hide malicious executables within PNG files.
     - **Evasion** by decoding the encoded blobs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-phishing and Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - These are common initial access techniques used by many threat actors, including Dropping Elephant, to gain a foothold in a target network.
   - **Steganography:**
     - Steganography involves hiding data within other files, such as images, to avoid detection. This technique is used to conceal the presence of malicious content.
   - **Evasion by Decoding Encoded Blobs:**
     - Decoding encoded blobs is a method to evade detection by security systems. This can be part of a multi-stage attack where the initial payload is hidden and only decoded when it is safe to execute.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Dropping Elephant's Known TTPs:**
     - Dropping Elephant is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
     - They have been observed using steganography to hide malicious content within images.
     - They often employ multi-stage attacks where the initial payload is obfuscated and only decoded or executed at a later stage to avoid detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the known TTPs of Dropping Elephant, it is plausible that they would use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files and then decode these blobs to evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
