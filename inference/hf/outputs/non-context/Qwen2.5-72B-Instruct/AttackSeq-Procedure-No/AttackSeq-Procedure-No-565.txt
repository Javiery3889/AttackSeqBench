### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.
   - Key elements to consider:
     - **T1195 Supply Chain Compromise**: This technique involves compromising a third-party software update mechanism to gain initial access to a target network.
     - **Resource Development**: This phase involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources for the attack, such as acquiring domains, setting up command and control (C2) servers, etc.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers parked domains for future use after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
     - This sequence is less likely because:
       - Resource Development typically occurs before the initial access to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place.
       - Parking domains is a preparatory step that is usually done before the attack to have a ready infrastructure for C2 communication, data exfiltration, etc.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers did not park domains for future use only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.
     - This sequence is more plausible because:
       - Resource Development, including parking domains, is a pre-attack phase.
       - It is more logical for attackers to have their infrastructure ready before they execute the initial access vector.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers did not park domains for future use only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector.

**Final Answer: B: No**
