### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement before mapping the network and collecting passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments are a common method for gaining initial access to a network. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) technique.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement. These tools are used to execute commands on remote systems, which is a common technique for moving laterally within a network (T1035, T1077).
   - **Network Mapping and Password Collection:**
     - After gaining a foothold and moving laterally, attackers typically map the network to understand the environment better. This can involve using tools like `net view`, `nbtstat`, or `nslookup` (T1018).
     - Collecting passwords is a crucial step in escalating privileges. This can be done through various methods, such as credential dumping (T1003) or pass-the-hash (T1075).
   - **Obtaining Domain Administrator Privileges:**
     - The ultimate goal of many attacks is to obtain domain administrator privileges, which can be achieved by leveraging the collected credentials and further lateral movement.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common progression in cyber attacks. After gaining initial access through spearphishing, using tools like PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, and then mapping the network and collecting passwords to escalate privileges is a well-documented attack pattern.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
