### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Russian-speaking cybercriminals have already caused multi-million dollar losses and have transferred or withdrawn money during the impact phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these cybercriminals will explore the financial systems of the targeted organizations using remote administration tools in the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is typically done to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact Phase:** The impact phase involves the attacker causing damage or achieving their primary objective, such as data exfiltration, financial theft, or system disruption.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question states that the cybercriminals have already caused financial losses and transferred or withdrawn money. This indicates that they have already achieved their primary objective in the impact phase.
     - Given that the primary objective has been achieved, it is less likely that the cybercriminals would return to the discovery phase to explore the financial systems further, as their main goal has already been accomplished.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the typical attack lifecycle, it is less likely that the cybercriminals would return to the discovery phase to explore the financial systems using remote administration tools after they have already achieved their primary objective in the impact phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
