### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Deep Panda.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion.
     - The rootkit employs Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to protect malicious artifacts.
     - Gaining persistence through the Milestone backdoor.
     - Copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
     - Creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fire Chili Rootkit and DKOM:**
     - The Fire Chili rootkit is known for its use of DKOM to hide malicious artifacts from detection. This is a common technique for defense evasion.
   - **Milestone Backdoor:**
     - The Milestone backdoor is a known tool used by Deep Panda for maintaining persistence on compromised systems.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Copying the backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry is a plausible method for achieving persistence. This technique involves:
       - **File Persistence:** Placing the backdoor in a common user directory.
       - **Service Persistence:** Creating a registry entry to ensure the backdoor runs at system startup.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of the Fire Chili rootkit with DKOM is a well-documented technique for evading detection. This aligns with the initial part of the sequence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Milestone backdoor is a known tool used by Deep Panda. The method described (copying to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2`) is a common and effective way to achieve persistence.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence of TTPs described is consistent with the known behavior of Deep Panda and the tools they use. The combination of defense evasion and persistence mechanisms is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns.
