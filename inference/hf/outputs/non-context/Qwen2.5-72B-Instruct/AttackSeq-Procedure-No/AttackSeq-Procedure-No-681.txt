### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that adversaries will use tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - **Reconnaissance:** Using tools like DOCKERGEDDON.
   - **Deployment of Malicious Containers:** Deploying malicious containers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gain access to the system by exploiting the misconfigured Docker API ports. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Reconnaissance:** Tools like DOCKERGEDDON are used to gather information about the Docker environment. This is typically done to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
   - **Deployment of Malicious Containers:** After gaining access and gathering information, the attackers deploy malicious containers to further their objectives.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Initial Access:** The attackers first need to gain access to the system. This is done by exploiting the misconfigured Docker API ports.
     - **Reconnaissance:** Once they have access, they would likely use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to gather more information about the Docker environment. This helps them understand the system better and identify additional vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
     - **Deployment of Malicious Containers:** After gathering the necessary information, the attackers would then deploy malicious containers to achieve their goals.

   - **Timing of Reconnaissance:**
     - It is more logical for the reconnaissance phase to occur after gaining initial access but before deploying malicious containers. This is because the reconnaissance phase helps the attackers understand the environment and plan their next steps more effectively.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question, where reconnaissance using tools like DOCKERGEDDON occurs only after deploying malicious containers, is less plausible. Reconnaissance is typically performed to gather information before deploying malicious containers.

### Final Answer: B: No
