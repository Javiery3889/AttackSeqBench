### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy, a known threat actor, is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.
   - The key elements to consider are:
     - **Initial Access:** The first step in the attack chain where the attacker gains entry into the victim's system.
     - **Infection Chains:** The subsequent steps involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access can be achieved through various methods such as phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
   - **Infection Chains:**
     - Malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs are typically used to maintain persistence, execute additional payloads, and perform other malicious activities.
     - These infection chains are often part of the post-exploitation phase, where the attacker has already gained initial access and is now working to establish a foothold and execute their objectives.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access vs. Infection Chains:**
     - It is highly unlikely that an attacker would use complex infection chains involving LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs without first establishing initial access. These infection chains are typically used to maintain and expand the attacker's presence within the victim's system.
     - Establishing initial access is a critical first step that allows the attacker to deploy these more sophisticated tools.
   - **SideCopy's TTPs:**
     - SideCopy, like many advanced threat actors, follows a structured attack sequence. They often use initial access vectors such as phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain entry, and then use more sophisticated techniques to maintain and expand their presence.

### Final Answer
Given the structured nature of SideCopy's attack sequences and the typical use of infection chains in the post-exploitation phase, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
