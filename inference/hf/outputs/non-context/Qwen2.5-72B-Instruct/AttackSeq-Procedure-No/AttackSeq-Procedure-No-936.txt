### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Darkhotel APT group seeds Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware.
   - The malware is downloaded thousands of times, providing initial access.
   - The question then asks if Darkhotel APT is likely to use Visual Basic or create VBScripts to execute malicious code before maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** Darkhotel APT is known for using various methods to gain initial access, including spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. Seeding P2P sites with malware is a plausible method for initial access.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:** Once initial access is gained, the next step is to execute the malicious code. Using Visual Basic (VB) or VBScripts is a common technique for executing malicious code because these scripts can be easily embedded in documents or downloaded files and are often used to bypass security measures.
   - **Persistence:** Maintaining persistence is a critical step in an APT attack. Adding autorun registry settings is a well-known method for ensuring that the malware runs every time the system starts, which is a common persistence technique.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes:** This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT is likely to use Visual Basic or VBScripts to execute malicious code and then maintain persistence through autorun registry settings.
   - **B: No:** This choice suggests that Darkhotel APT is not likely to use these techniques.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the known tactics of Darkhotel APT, using VB or VBScripts for execution and autorun registry settings for persistence aligns well with their typical behavior.
   - These techniques are common in the APT world and are consistent with the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
