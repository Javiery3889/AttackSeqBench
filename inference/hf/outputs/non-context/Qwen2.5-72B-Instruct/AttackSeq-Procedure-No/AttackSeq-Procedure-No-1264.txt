### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Using commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` to gather information about the system and network.
     - **Password Spraying via SMB:** Attempting to gain access to multiple accounts by using a single password across multiple accounts.
     - **Emptying Log Files:** Removing evidence of the attack.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Moving from one system to another within the network.
     - **Process Injection on Remote Computers:** Injecting code into processes on remote systems to maintain persistence or execute commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** Using commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` is a common technique in the discovery phase to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Password Spraying via SMB:** This technique is often used to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network. However, it is typically used after the discovery phase to identify potential targets.
   - **Emptying Log Files:** This is a post-exploitation technique used to cover tracks and avoid detection. It is usually performed after gaining access and before or during lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This involves moving from one system to another within the network, often using techniques like pass-the-hash or remote service execution.
   - **Process Injection on Remote Computers:** This is a technique used to maintain persistence or execute commands on remote systems, typically after gaining access and during lateral movement.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that password spraying via SMB is used to empty log files before lateral movement. This is not a typical sequence.
   - **Typical Sequence:**
     1. **Discovery Phase:** Use commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` to gather information.
     2. **Initial Access:** Use techniques like password spraying via SMB to gain access.
     3. **Post-Exploitation:** Empty log files to cover tracks.
     4. **Lateral Movement:** Move to other systems within the network.
     5. **Persistence:** Use techniques like process injection on remote computers to maintain access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not typical. Password spraying via SMB is not usually used to empty log files before lateral movement. Instead, log files are typically emptied after gaining access to cover tracks.

### Final Answer: B: No
