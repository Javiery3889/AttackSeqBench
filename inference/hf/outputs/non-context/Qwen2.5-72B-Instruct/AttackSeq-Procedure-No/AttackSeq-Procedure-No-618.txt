### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Hidden Cobra targets Turkish financial organizations using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will create profile pages in Microsoft TechNet to use as C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure under the tactic of Resource Development.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access TTPs:**
     - Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Initial Access" and the technique "Spearphishing Attachment" (T1193).
   - **Resource Development TTPs:**
     - The question mentions the creation of profile pages in Microsoft TechNet for C2 infrastructure. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Resource Development" and the technique "Compromise Accounts" (T1584) or "Compromise Infrastructure" (T1583).
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Hidden Cobra, also known as Lazarus Group, is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks. They often use a variety of techniques to maintain persistence and establish C2 infrastructure.
     - Creating profile pages in Microsoft TechNet for C2 infrastructure is a plausible method for resource development, as it can provide a legitimate-looking platform for communication and data exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing with a known exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to gain initial access. This is a common and effective method for initial compromise.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is logical for the attackers to establish a robust C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised systems.
     - Using legitimate-looking platforms like Microsoft TechNet for C2 can help evade detection and provide a reliable communication channel.
   - **Historical Context:**
     - Hidden Cobra has been known to use various methods to establish C2 infrastructure, including compromising legitimate websites and creating fake profiles on social media and other platforms.
