### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by malware:
     1. The malware uses the command `cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo` to gather system information.
     2. The gathered information is sent to the IP address `45.124.132.127`.
     3. The question asks if it is likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control (C2) server only after contacting the domain `marina-info.net` for further operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the malware will only establish an HTTPS communication with the C2 server after contacting `marina-info.net`.
     - This implies a specific sequence where the malware must first contact `marina-info.net` before proceeding to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware does not necessarily need to contact `marina-info.net` before establishing an HTTPS communication with the C2 server.
     - This implies that the malware can proceed to the C2 server directly after sending the initial system information to `45.124.132.127`.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial actions described (gathering system information and sending it to `45.124.132.127`) are typical early stages of a malware infection.
   - Malware often has a predefined sequence of actions, but it is not always necessary for it to contact an additional domain before establishing a C2 communication.
   - The question does not provide any specific information or context that suggests the malware must contact `marina-info.net` before proceeding to the C2 server.
   - In many cases, malware will establish a C2 communication as soon as possible to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
