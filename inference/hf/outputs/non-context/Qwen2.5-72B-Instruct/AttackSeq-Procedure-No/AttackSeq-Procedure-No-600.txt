### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Sednit group's malware targeting specific IP ranges for vulnerability scanning during the Discovery phase after gaining initial access through malicious documents with VBA macros.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents containing VBA macros.
   - **Discovery:** Targeting IP ranges for vulnerability scanning, specifically related to government and critical infrastructure organizations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (VBA Macros):**
     - The Sednit group is known for using malicious documents with VBA macros to gain initial access to target systems. This is a common TTP for this group.
   - **Discovery (Vulnerability Scanning):**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for advanced threat actors like the Sednit group to perform reconnaissance and discovery activities. This includes scanning for vulnerabilities in the network, especially in critical infrastructure and government organizations, which are often high-value targets.
   - **Targeting Specific IP Ranges:**
     - The Sednit group has a history of targeting specific sectors, including government and critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is plausible that they would focus their vulnerability scanning on IP ranges associated with these organizations.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the known TTPs of the Sednit group, it is highly likely that they would target specific IP ranges for vulnerability scanning during the Discovery phase after gaining initial access through malicious documents with VBA macros.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
