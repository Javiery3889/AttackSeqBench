### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by WinDealer.
   - The sequence in question is: 
     1. Use FTP for C2 (Command and Control) communication.
     2. Steal information from SNS (Social Networking Services) applications.
     3. Encrypt the stolen data using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP for C2 Communication:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is not typically used for C2 communication in modern malware. C2 communication often uses more secure and less detectable protocols such as HTTPS, DNS, or custom protocols.
     - FTP is more commonly used for data exfiltration, but not for command and control.
   - **Stealing Information from SNS Applications:**
     - This is a common TTP for many malware families, including WinDealer. Malware often targets sensitive information from social networking services to gather personal data.
   - **Encrypting Stolen Data Using AES:**
     - Encrypting stolen data is a common practice to protect the data from being intercepted or read during exfiltration. AES is a strong and widely used encryption standard.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence starts with using FTP for C2 communication, which is less likely because FTP is not a secure or stealthy method for C2.
   - The other steps (stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting the data) are plausible and common in malware operations.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the sequence starting with FTP for C2 communication is less likely to be used by WinDealer. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
