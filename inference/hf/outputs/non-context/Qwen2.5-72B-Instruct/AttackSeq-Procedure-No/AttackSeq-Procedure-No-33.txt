### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a hypothetical malware called Machete.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Staging collected data in a temporary folder.
     2. Encrypting files and logs.
     3. Collecting data by copying files from removable media.
     4. Conducting discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks.
     5. Enumerating running processes.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Staging and Encryption:**
     - Staging collected data in a temporary folder and encrypting files and logs are common post-exploitation techniques used to prepare data for exfiltration.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes are typical discovery techniques used to gather information about the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Copying files from removable media is a specific data collection technique that involves gathering data from external storage devices.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to collect data by copying files from removable media **only after** conducting discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes.
   - In a typical attack sequence, discovery activities (like listing Wi-Fi networks and enumerating processes) are usually performed early in the attack to gather information about the environment. This information is then used to inform subsequent actions, such as data collection.
   - However, the question implies a specific order where data collection from removable media happens **only after** these discovery activities. This is not a common or necessary sequence, as data collection can often occur independently of or concurrently with discovery activities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical attack sequence and the logical flow of TTPs, it is not likely that Machete would collect data by copying files from removable media only after conducting discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes. Discovery activities are important but do not necessarily dictate the timing of data collection from removable media.

### Final Answer: B: No
