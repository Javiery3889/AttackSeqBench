### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether UNC2452 (a known threat actor) is likely to have used Discovery techniques (such as querying the registry and identifying running processes) only after establishing Command and Control (C2) communications using an Application Layer Protocol.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **C2 Communications (Command and Control):** This involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it.
   - **Discovery Techniques:** These include actions like querying the registry and identifying running processes to gather information about the system and the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communications First:**
     - Establishing C2 communications is often a critical first step for an attacker to maintain control over a compromised system. Without a reliable C2 channel, the attacker would have limited ability to execute further actions.
   - **Discovery Techniques After C2:**
     - Once the C2 channel is established, the attacker can use it to send commands to the compromised system to perform discovery techniques. This allows the attacker to gather detailed information about the system and the network, which is essential for planning further actions such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This answer suggests that UNC2452 is likely to have used discovery techniques only after establishing C2 communications. This aligns with the typical attack sequence where C2 is established first to maintain control and then discovery techniques are used to gather information.
   - **B: No**
     - This answer suggests that UNC2452 is not likely to have used discovery techniques only after establishing C2 communications. This would imply that discovery techniques were used before or independently of C2, which is less common and less strategic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
