### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant will use ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for Command and Control (C2) communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Korplug will use ICMP for C2 communications.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Korplug will not use ICMP for C2 communications.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Korplug Variant:**
     - Korplug is a known malware family that has been observed to use various techniques for C2 communications. However, the specific use of ICMP for C2 is not a common or well-documented behavior for Korplug.
   - **ICMP for C2:**
     - ICMP is sometimes used for C2 communications because it can be less detectable than other protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. However, it is not a standard or widely used method for C2 in many malware families, including Korplug.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - The question mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This is a common behavior for many malware variants, including Korplug, but it does not necessarily imply the use of ICMP for C2.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of Korplug and the less common use of ICMP for C2, it is less likely that Korplug would use ICMP for C2 communications.

### Final Answer: B: No
