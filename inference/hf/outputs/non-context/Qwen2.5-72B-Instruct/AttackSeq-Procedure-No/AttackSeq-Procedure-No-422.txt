### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a campaign that starts with phishing emails.
   - The phishing emails contain a malicious document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails containing a malicious document.
   - **Exploitation:** Exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Phishing Emails):**
     - Phishing emails are a common method for gaining initial access to a target's system. The malicious document 'Richard_Johnson.doc' is likely to contain a payload that, when opened, will execute malicious code on the victim's machine.
   - **Exploitation (CVE-2018-13379):**
     - CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS, a network security appliance. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a path traversal attack, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files.
     - Exploiting this vulnerability typically requires network access to the FortiOS device, which is not directly related to the initial access gained through phishing emails.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While phishing emails can be used to gain initial access to a victim's system, the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices is a separate and more specialized step.
   - The initial access through phishing emails would likely be used to establish a foothold on the victim's network. From there, the attacker might perform further reconnaissance to identify and target specific network devices, such as FortiOS appliances.
   - However, the question does not provide any information suggesting that the attacker has already identified and targeted FortiOS devices or that they have the necessary network access to exploit CVE-2018-13379.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the information provided, it is not likely that the campaign will immediately exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails. The exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 would require additional steps and specific targeting of FortiOS devices, which are not indicated in the question.

### Final Answer: B: No
