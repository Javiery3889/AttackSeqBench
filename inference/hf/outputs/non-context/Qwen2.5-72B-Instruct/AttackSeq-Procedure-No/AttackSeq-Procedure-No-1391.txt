### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
   - Key TTPs mentioned:
     - Dumping LSASS process memory (Credential Access)
     - Gathering information on network and host configurations (Reconnaissance)

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dumping LSASS Process Memory:**
     - This is a common technique used by attackers to extract credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process. It is often used to gain access to additional credentials that can be used to move laterally within a network.
     - This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK category of "Credential Access" (T1003: OS Credential Dumping).

   - **Gathering Information on Network and Host Configurations:**
     - This involves using native OS binaries to collect information about the network and host configurations, which is a form of reconnaissance.
     - This falls under the MITRE ATT&CK category of "Reconnaissance" (T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery, T1082: System Information Discovery).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical for an attacker to first obtain credentials (Credential Access) before performing reconnaissance. This is because having credentials can provide the attacker with the necessary access to gather more detailed and sensitive information.
     - Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials is often a precursor to more advanced activities, including reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of operations and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is likely that FIN13 would dump the LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
