### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Energetic Bear conducting a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Widespread scanning of target environments to identify vulnerabilities.
     2. Compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack.
     3. Conducting a watering hole attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Widespread Scanning:**
     - Energetic Bear, also known as Dragonfly, is known for conducting extensive reconnaissance and scanning activities to identify vulnerabilities in target environments. This is a common initial step in their attack lifecycle.
   - **Supply Chain Attack:**
     - Energetic Bear has been known to compromise supply chain elements to gain access to target networks. This can include compromising software vendors or other trusted third parties.
   - **Watering Hole Attack:**
     - A watering hole attack involves compromising a website that the target frequently visits to deliver malware. This is a plausible next step after gaining access to a supply chain element.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with Energetic Bear's known TTPs:
     1. **Scanning for Vulnerabilities:** This is a common initial step to identify potential entry points.
     2. **Supply Chain Compromise:** Once vulnerabilities are identified, compromising a supply chain element can provide a foothold in the target environment.
     3. **Watering Hole Attack:** Using the compromised supply chain to set up a watering hole attack is a strategic move to infect the target.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the known TTPs of Energetic Bear, the sequence described in the question is highly plausible.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
