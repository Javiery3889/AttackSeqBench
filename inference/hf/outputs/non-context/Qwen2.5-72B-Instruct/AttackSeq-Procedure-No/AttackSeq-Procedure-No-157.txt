### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack vector: spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - It then asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared Managed Service Provider (MSP) infrastructure for lateral movement before conducting internal reconnaissance.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - APT10 is known for using spear phishing as an initial attack vector to gain access to target networks.
     - Once initial access is gained, APT10 has been observed leveraging shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between different MSPs and their clients.
     - After gaining access to the MSP infrastructure, APT10 typically conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network and identify valuable assets.
     - This sequence aligns with the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of APT10.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer would imply that APT10 does not leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement after gaining initial access.
     - However, this contradicts the known behavior of APT10, which has been documented to use shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the known TTPs of APT10, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT10 would leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement after gaining initial access through spear phishing, followed by internal reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
