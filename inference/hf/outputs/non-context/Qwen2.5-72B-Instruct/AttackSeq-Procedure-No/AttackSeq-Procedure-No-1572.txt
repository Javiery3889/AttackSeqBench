### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca used `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques before targeting user credentials using tools like `procdump` to dump the `lsass` process memory and retrieve credential hashes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Bypass Application Control:** Using `regsvr32.exe` to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Credential Access:** Using `procdump` to dump the `lsass` process memory to retrieve credential hashes.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - **Bypass Application Control:** `regsvr32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that can be abused to execute arbitrary code, often used to bypass application control mechanisms. This is a common technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Tactic "Defense Evasion" (T1117).
     - **Credential Access:** `procdump` is a legitimate tool that can be used to dump the memory of processes, including the `lsass` process, which contains credential hashes. This is a common technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Tactic "Credential Access" (T1003).
     - **Sequence Plausibility:** The sequence of using `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control and then using `procdump` to dump the `lsass` process memory is a plausible and well-documented attack sequence.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs described is not likely. However, given the common use of `regsvr32.exe` for bypassing application control and `procdump` for credential access, this sequence is indeed likely.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
