### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the DNSpionage malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Retrieving the username, hostname, and domain information.
     - **Execution Phase:** Decoding a PE file encoded with base64 and executing it as a scheduled task.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase is a common initial step in many malware attacks. It helps the malware understand the environment it is operating in, which can be crucial for subsequent actions.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The execution phase involves the actual running of malicious code. In this case, the malware decodes a PE file (Portable Executable) that is encoded in base64 and then executes it as a scheduled task.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that the malware would first gather information about the environment (discovery phase) before executing the next stage of its attack (execution phase). This is because the information gathered during the discovery phase can help the malware make informed decisions about how to proceed, such as choosing the right payload or method of execution.
     - However, the question asks if it is **only** then that the malware will decode and execute the PE file. This implies that the decoding and execution are strictly dependent on the completion of the discovery phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - While it is common for malware to perform discovery before execution, it is not necessarily the case that the execution phase will only occur after the discovery phase. Malware can have multiple stages and may perform different actions in parallel or in a different order depending on its design and the specific attack scenario.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not strictly necessary for the execution phase to only occur after the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
