### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first package and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS to a command and control (C2) server.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries manipulate memory and processes to evade detection using functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` only after transmitting the data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Command and Control (C2) Activities:**
       - Packaging and transmitting data over HTTP/HTTPS to a C2 server is a common TTP used by adversaries to exfiltrate data and maintain communication with the C2 server.
     - **Memory and Process Manipulation:**
       - Functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwMapViewOfSection` are typically used to manipulate memory and processes to evade detection by security software. These functions can be used to change memory protection attributes or map sections of memory, which can help in hiding malicious code or data.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is more logical for adversaries to manipulate memory and processes to evade detection before or during the C2 activities rather than after. This is because:
       - **Before C2 Activities:**
         - Manipulating memory and processes before C2 activities can help ensure that the data being transmitted is not detected or intercepted by security software.
       - **During C2 Activities:**
         - Manipulating memory and processes during C2 activities can help maintain a low profile and avoid detection while the data is being transmitted.
       - **After C2 Activities:**
         - Manipulating memory and processes after the data has been transmitted is less effective because the data has already been sent, and the risk of detection is higher.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs, it is not likely that adversaries would manipulate memory and processes to evade detection only after transmitting data over HTTP/HTTPS to a C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
