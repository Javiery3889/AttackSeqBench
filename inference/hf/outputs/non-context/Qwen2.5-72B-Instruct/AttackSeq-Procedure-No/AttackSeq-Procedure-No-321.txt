### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an app uploads files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the app will send gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP for C2 Operations:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is often used for transferring files between a client and a server. In the context of C2 operations, it can be used to exfiltrate data or receive commands.
   - **Performing Routines on the iOS Device:**
     - "Performing routines" could refer to various activities such as data collection, data processing, or other malicious activities on the device.
   - **Sending Information via HTTP:**
     - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is commonly used for web communications. It can be used to send data to a server, which is a common technique in C2 operations.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the app first uses FTP for C2 operations and then performs routines on the iOS device.
   - After performing these routines, the app is asked if it is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP.
   - It is plausible that an attacker would use multiple protocols (FTP and HTTP) to achieve different stages of the attack. For example, FTP for initial data exfiltration and HTTP for subsequent data transmission or command execution.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the nature of C2 operations and the use of multiple protocols, it is reasonable to assume that the app might use HTTP to send gathered information after performing routines on the device.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is "likely" to send information via HTTP only after performing routines, which implies a specific sequence that might not always be the case.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is plausible, but it is not necessarily the only or most likely sequence. The use of multiple protocols and the timing of data transmission can vary based on the attacker's strategy and the specific malware being used. Therefore, it is not definitively "likely" that the app will send information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.
