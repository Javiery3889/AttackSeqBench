### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a multi-stage command and control (C2) operation.
   - The first stage involves the distribution of Seduploader malware via a control server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious document will use the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Seduploader Malware:**
     - Seduploader is a known first-stage malware often used to establish initial access and download additional payloads.
   - **Microsoft Office DDE Technique:**
     - DDE is a technique that can be used to execute arbitrary commands, often used in malicious documents to invoke PowerShell or other command-line tools.
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that can be used to execute encoded commands, often used in multi-stage attacks to download and execute additional malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Contact with Control Server:**
     - The initial contact with the control server to distribute Seduploader is a common first step in a multi-stage attack.
   - **Use of DDE in Malicious Documents:**
     - Malicious documents often use DDE to execute PowerShell commands, which can then be used to download and execute additional malware.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that Seduploader is a first-stage malware, it is plausible that the malicious document used to distribute it would use DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands to facilitate the download and execution of additional payloads.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
