### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the FHAPPI campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing encoded PowerShell commands.
     - Downloading and executing payloads from URLs.
     - Establishing a connection with a C2 (Command and Control) server at 61.97.243.15.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing the C2 connection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fileless Techniques:**
     - Fileless techniques involve executing code directly in memory without writing files to the disk, which can help avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the initial steps (executing PowerShell commands and downloading payloads) are already in place.
     - Establishing a C2 connection is a critical step in maintaining control over the compromised system.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is common for attackers to use fileless techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection after establishing a C2 connection. This is because once the C2 connection is established, the attacker can issue commands and execute additional payloads in memory, reducing the risk of detection.
     - However, the question specifies "only after establishing connection with the C2 server," which implies that fileless techniques are not used before this point.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is plausible that the FHAPPI campaign would use fileless techniques to avoid detection after establishing the C2 connection. However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that fileless techniques are used "only after" the C2 connection, which suggests that fileless techniques might also be used earlier in the attack.

   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that fileless techniques are not used "only after" the C2 connection, but rather can be used at multiple stages of the attack.

**Final Answer: B: No**
