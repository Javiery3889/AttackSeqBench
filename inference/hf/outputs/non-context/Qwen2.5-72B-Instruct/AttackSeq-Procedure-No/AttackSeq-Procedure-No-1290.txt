### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda (also known as APT27 or Bronze President).
   - The sequence starts with the use of a double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in a spearphishing campaign to evade defenses.
   - The question then asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Double Extension Trick (sample.doc.lnk):**
     - This is a common technique used in spearphishing to trick users into opening malicious files. The `.lnk` extension is often hidden by default in Windows, making the file appear as a benign `.doc` file.
   - **Reverse SOCKS Proxy Module:**
     - A reverse SOCKS proxy is a technique used to establish a tunnel from a compromised internal network to an external command and control (C2) server. This allows the attacker to control the compromised system and exfiltrate data while maintaining a low profile.
   - **Mustang Panda's TTPs:**
     - Mustang Panda is known for using a variety of TTPs, including spearphishing, fileless malware, and sophisticated communication techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
     - They have been observed using reverse proxies and other methods to communicate with C2 servers, which aligns with the use of a reverse SOCKS proxy module.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that Mustang Panda is known for using sophisticated communication techniques and has been observed using reverse proxies, it is plausible that they would use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy after successfully compromising a system through a spearphishing campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
