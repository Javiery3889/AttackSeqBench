### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the behavior of the lightSpy malware.
   - It mentions that lightSpy uses hardcoded C&C (Command and Control) server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.
   - The question asks if it is likely that lightSpy first performs data collection by targeting specific types of data (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data such as WeChat, QQ, and Telegram).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that lightSpy is likely to first perform data collection before exfiltration.
     - This is a common sequence in many malware operations. Malware often collects data first to ensure it has the necessary information before sending it to the C&C server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that lightSpy is not likely to first perform data collection.
     - This would imply that lightSpy might perform other actions before data collection, which is less common in typical malware behavior.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Malware typically follows a sequence where it first establishes a connection to the C&C server, then performs data collection, and finally exfiltrates the data.
   - The question states that lightSpy uses hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration, which implies that it has already established a connection to the C&C server.
   - Given that the malware has a main control module (light) and is designed to exfiltrate data, it is logical that it would first collect the data it needs before exfiltrating it.
   - Targeting specific types of data (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data) is a common tactic in data collection phases of malware operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
