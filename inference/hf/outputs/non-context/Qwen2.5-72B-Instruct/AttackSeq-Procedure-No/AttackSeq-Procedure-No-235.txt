### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The malware uses InstallUtil.exe to evade detection by bypassing Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - The question asks whether the malware is likely to create a scheduled task to ensure persistence after evading detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses InstallUtil.exe to bypass Smartscreen and AppLocker.
   - **Persistence:** The question asks if the malware is likely to create a scheduled task to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (InstallUtil.exe):** InstallUtil.exe is a legitimate .NET utility that can be abused by attackers to execute arbitrary code. It is often used to bypass security mechanisms like Smartscreen and AppLocker because it is a trusted binary.
   - **Persistence (Scheduled Task):** Creating a scheduled task is a common technique used by malware to ensure that it runs automatically at specific intervals or upon certain triggers. This helps the malware maintain a foothold on the system even after the initial infection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After successfully evading detection using InstallUtil.exe, it is highly likely that the malware would take additional steps to ensure persistence.
   - Creating a scheduled task is a straightforward and effective method for achieving persistence.
   - The use of InstallUtil.exe for initial execution and evasion is often followed by persistence mechanisms to maintain control over the compromised system.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
