### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Discovery**: Gathering system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.
     2. **Command and Control (C2)**: Sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password.
     3. **Persistence**: Establishing persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery**: This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the malware gathers information about the compromised system. This helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: After gathering information, the malware typically communicates with the C&C server to report the data and receive further instructions. This is a crucial step for the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Persistence**: Establishing persistence is a technique used to ensure that the malware remains active even after the system is restarted. This is often done after the initial communication with the C&C server, as the attacker may need to send specific instructions or configurations to the malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Discovery** is the first step where the malware gathers information.
     2. **Command and Control** is the next step where the malware communicates with the C&C server.
     3. **Persistence** is the final step where the malware ensures it remains active.
   - The question specifically asks if the malware will establish persistence only after sending the collected data to the C&C domain. This is a reasonable assumption because the C&C server might need to send specific instructions or configurations to the malware before it establishes persistence.
