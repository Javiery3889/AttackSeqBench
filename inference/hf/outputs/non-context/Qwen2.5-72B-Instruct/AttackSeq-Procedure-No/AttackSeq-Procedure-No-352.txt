### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - This exploit drops an embedded downloader file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as `GetFileAttributesW` and `GetSystemInfo` before establishing command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploit:**
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a common method for initial access.
     - The exploit drops an embedded downloader file, which is typical in multi-stage attacks to download and execute additional malware.

   - **MSIL/Crimson Malware:**
     - MSIL/Crimson is a type of malware known for its modular nature and ability to perform various malicious activities.
     - Before establishing C2, malware often performs reconnaissance and system information gathering to understand the environment and plan further actions.

   - **Native Windows Functions:**
     - `GetFileAttributesW` is a Windows API function used to retrieve attributes of a file or directory.
     - `GetSystemInfo` is a Windows API function used to retrieve information about the system, such as the processor architecture and the number of processors.
     - These functions are commonly used by malware to gather system information, which is crucial for determining the next steps in the attack.

   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Establishing C2 is a critical step in the attack lifecycle, allowing the attacker to control the compromised system and execute further commands.
     - It is logical for malware to gather system information before establishing C2 to ensure the C2 communication is tailored to the specific environment.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware like MSIL/Crimson, it is highly likely that the malware will execute native Windows functions to gather system information before establishing C2.
   - This sequence aligns with the common attack patterns described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where reconnaissance and system information gathering are often performed before C2 establishment.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
