### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence initiated by APT28 using a malicious document.
   - The document leverages the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique via PowerShell to download and run encoded commands.
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DDE Technique via PowerShell:**
     - DDE is a technique that can be used to execute arbitrary commands, often leading to the download and execution of malware.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks, including downloading and running malicious payloads.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - Hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts is a common persistence technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts.
     - This technique involves modifying the startup scripts of legitimate applications to include malicious code, which can be a logical next step after initial execution.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts.
     - Given the nature of APT28 and their sophisticated attack techniques, it is plausible that they would use persistence mechanisms to ensure the malware remains active on the system.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts.
     - This choice seems less plausible because persistence is a common and effective technique in advanced attacks.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
