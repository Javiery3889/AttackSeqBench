### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets.
     2. Leveraging the victim’s trusted relationships.
     3. Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing the user’s contacts and extracting system and network information.
     4. Moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - APT42 is known to use spear-phishing as an initial access technique to compromise targets.
   - **Leveraging Trusted Relationships:**
     - Once a target is compromised, APT42 often leverages the victim’s trusted relationships to send additional spear-phishing emails to other targets within the organization.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT42 typically conducts internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network and systems. This includes accessing user contacts and extracting system and network information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a common next step after reconnaissance. APT42 uses compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts, which is a form of lateral movement.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Spear-phishing emails to additional targets.
     2. Leveraging trusted relationships.
     3. Internal reconnaissance.
     4. Lateral movement using compromised personal email accounts.
   - This sequence is logical and aligns with the typical attack pattern of APT42.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of an APT42 attack.

### Final Answer:
