### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PowerLess Backdoor.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Targeting local user accounts for account discovery.
     2. Achieving credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
     3. Utilizing a keylogger afterward.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Account Discovery:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. The attacker needs to identify the local user accounts to understand the environment and potential targets.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' is a known technique for credential access. 'Comsvcs.dll' is a legitimate Windows DLL that can be abused to dump credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process.
   - **Keylogger:**
     - A keylogger is a tool used to capture keystrokes, which can be used to gather additional credentials or sensitive information. However, it is typically used as a persistent method to gather credentials over time, rather than as a follow-up to a one-time credential dump.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible but not the most efficient or common approach. Typically, after discovering accounts and dumping credentials, an attacker would use the obtained credentials to gain further access or move laterally within the network. Using a keylogger afterward is less common and might be redundant if the attacker already has the necessary credentials.
   - However, the use of a keylogger could be a secondary measure to ensure continuous access to new credentials or to capture additional sensitive information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the sequence is not the most common, it is still plausible. The attacker might use a keylogger to ensure they have a continuous stream of credentials, especially if the initial dump does not provide all the necessary access.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described is not the most common or efficient approach, and the use of a keylogger after dumping credentials is less typical. However, it is still a plausible sequence, but not the most likely one.
