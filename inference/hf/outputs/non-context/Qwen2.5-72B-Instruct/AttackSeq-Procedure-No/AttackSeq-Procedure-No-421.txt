### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a campaign involving phishing emails.
   - The emails contain a Microsoft Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
   - The document is said to execute VBS macros.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the VBS macros are executed before gaining initial access through the phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** In the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, "Initial Access" is the first step in the attack chain where the adversary gains a foothold in the target environment. This is typically achieved through methods like phishing emails.
   - **Execution of VBS Macros:** The execution of VBS macros is a technique used to run malicious code on the victim's system. This typically happens after the initial access is gained, as the user opens the document and the macros are triggered.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. The attacker sends phishing emails to the target.
     2. The target opens the email and clicks on the attached 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
     3. The document contains VBS macros, which are executed when the document is opened.
     4. The execution of the VBS macros leads to further malicious activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through the phishing email itself, as the user opens the email and interacts with the attachment.
   - The execution of VBS macros is a subsequent step that occurs after the initial access is gained.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the VBS macros are executed before gaining initial access. The initial access is the prerequisite for the execution of the VBS macros.
