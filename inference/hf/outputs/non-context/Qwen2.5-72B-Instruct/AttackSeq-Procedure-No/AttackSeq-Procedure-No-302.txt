### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the IEXPL0RE RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The RAT records keystrokes and exfiltrates data such as passwords.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the RAT would use blogs and WordPress for C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Encrypted HTTP POST and GET Methods:**
     - These methods are commonly used for C2 communication because they are reliable, widely supported, and can blend in with normal web traffic, making them less likely to be detected by network security tools.
     - They provide a secure and encrypted channel for data exfiltration and receiving further instructions.
   - **Blogs and WordPress:**
     - Using blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure is less common and more unusual.
     - While it is possible to use these platforms for C2, they are less secure and more likely to be detected by security systems.
     - Blogs and WordPress are typically used for legitimate content, and using them for C2 can be more easily flagged as suspicious behavior.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the common practices in C2 infrastructure and the need for secure and reliable communication, it is less likely that the IEXPL0RE RAT would use blogs and WordPress for C2 instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods.

**Final Answer: B: No**
