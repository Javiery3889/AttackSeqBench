### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Emissary Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     2. Performing network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems.
     3. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Mimikatz to Dump Credentials:**
     - Mimikatz is a tool used to extract credentials from memory, often used after gaining initial access to a system. This is a common technique for lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - **Performing Network Reconnaissance:**
     - Network reconnaissance is typically performed to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities within the network. This step is crucial for understanding the network topology and identifying systems that can be exploited.
   - **Exploiting a Vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to Install Webshells:**
     - Exploiting a specific vulnerability like CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells is a targeted attack. This step is usually performed after identifying the vulnerable system through reconnaissance.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that Emissary Panda first used Mimikatz to dump credentials, which would provide them with the necessary access to perform network reconnaissance.
   - After gaining the credentials, they would then perform network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, including the one with the SharePoint vulnerability.
   - Only after identifying the vulnerable SharePoint system would they exploit the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability to install webshells.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns. It is unlikely that Emissary Panda would perform network reconnaissance only after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability, as reconnaissance is a necessary step to identify the vulnerable system in the first place.

### Final Answer: B: No
