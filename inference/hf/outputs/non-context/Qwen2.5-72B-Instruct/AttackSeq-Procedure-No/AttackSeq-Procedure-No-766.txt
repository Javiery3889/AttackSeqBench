### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Iranian state-backed hackers used phishing attacks through email and social media to gain initial access.
   - The targets were individuals involved in sanctions against Iran.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the hackers scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Scanning specific lists of target IP addresses is a common technique used in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. This helps attackers identify potential vulnerabilities and tailor their attacks more effectively.
     - Given that the attackers are state-backed and targeting specific individuals involved in sanctions, it is highly likely that they would use such a method to ensure their attacks are more precise and effective.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not scan specific lists of target IP addresses.
     - While it is possible that they did not, it is less likely given the sophistication and targeted nature of the attack described.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attack sequence described involves a sophisticated and targeted approach, which is typical of state-backed operations.
   - Scanning specific lists of target IP addresses is a standard reconnaissance technique that helps in tailoring the attack to the specific targets.
   - Given the context of the attack and the nature of the targets, it is highly likely that the attackers would have used this technique to ensure their phishing attacks were more effective.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
