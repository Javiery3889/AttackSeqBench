### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milestone backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - System information discovery
     - Screen capture
     - Communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server over a non-standard port
     - Exfiltration of data through the same C2 channel

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:**
     - These are common initial steps in many cyber attacks. The attacker gathers information about the system and captures the screen to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Communication with a C2 Server:**
     - After gathering information, the backdoor typically needs to communicate with a C2 server to send the collected data and receive further instructions.
   - **Non-Standard Port:**
     - Using a non-standard port for C2 communication is a common tactic to evade detection by network security systems, which often monitor standard ports.
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - Once the backdoor has established communication with the C2 server, it can exfiltrate the collected data through the same channel.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns. The backdoor would likely use a non-standard port to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection and then exfiltrate the data through the same channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
