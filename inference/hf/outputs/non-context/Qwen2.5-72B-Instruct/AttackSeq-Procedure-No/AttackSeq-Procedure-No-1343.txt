### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where AURORA PANDA uses CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization’s website.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - AURORA PANDA uses CVE-2014-0322 to gain initial access.
     - The exploit is delivered through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization’s website.
     - The initial payload is ZxShell malware.
   - **Post-Exploitation:**
     - The question suggests that Sakula malware is used to communicate with the C2 infrastructure.
     - However, it specifies that Sakula is used "only before leveraging the exploit code."

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The exploit (CVE-2014-0322) is used to gain initial access.
     - ZxShell malware is deployed as the initial payload.
     - Sakula malware is mentioned as a communication tool with the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - Typically, once initial access is gained and the initial payload (ZxShell) is deployed, the attacker would use the initial payload to establish a foothold and communicate with the C2 infrastructure.
     - It is unusual for an attacker to use a different malware (Sakula) to communicate with the C2 infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code, as the initial payload (ZxShell) would already be in place and capable of communication.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (using Sakula only before leveraging the exploit code) is not a typical or logical sequence of events in a cyber attack.
     - It is more plausible that ZxShell would be used for communication with the C2 infrastructure after the initial access is gained.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
