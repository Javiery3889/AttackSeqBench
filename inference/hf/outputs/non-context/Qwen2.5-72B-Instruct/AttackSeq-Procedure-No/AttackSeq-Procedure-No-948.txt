### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus Group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Compromising legitimate privileged accounts.
     - Using these accounts for lateral movement.
     - Communicating with C2 (Command and Control) servers using a self-designed encryption algorithm.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group used legitimate websites for C2 through dead drop resolvers, specifically mentioning GitHub and Pastebin.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromising Legitimate Privileged Accounts:**
     - This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to gain deeper access within a network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once inside the network, attackers often move laterally to gain access to more systems and data.
   - **Self-Designed Encryption Algorithm for C2 Communication:**
     - Using custom encryption can help evade detection by standard security tools.
   - **Using Legitimate Websites for C2:**
     - Dead drop resolvers (DDR) involve using legitimate websites to host C2 instructions or data. This technique is used to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
     - GitHub and Pastebin are commonly used for this purpose because they are legitimate and widely used, making it harder for defenders to block or flag traffic to these sites.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The Lazarus Group is known for using sophisticated and stealthy techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - Using legitimate websites for C2 is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" tactic.
   - Given the group's history of using advanced and stealthy methods, it is highly plausible that they would use legitimate websites like GitHub and Pastebin for C2.

### Final Answer:
