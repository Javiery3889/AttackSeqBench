### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence involves collecting information using a script called `versioninfo.bat`.
   - The question asks whether the collected data is exfiltrated via a POST request before being sent through `unactivate.vbs`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the collected data is exfiltrated via a POST request before being sent through `unactivate.vbs`.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the collected data is not exfiltrated via a POST request before being sent through `unactivate.vbs`.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Data Collection and Exfiltration:**
     - It is common for APT groups to collect information about the victim's system and exfiltrate it to their command and control (C2) server.
     - Exfiltration via HTTP POST requests is a common method used by APT groups to send data to their C2 servers.
   - **Script Execution:**
     - The use of `versioninfo.bat` to collect information and `unactivate.vbs` to send the data suggests a multi-step process.
     - It is plausible that the data collected by `versioninfo.bat` is first exfiltrated via a POST request before any further actions are taken by `unactivate.vbs`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practices of APT groups and the described sequence of actions, it is more plausible that the data is exfiltrated via a POST request before being sent through `unactivate.vbs`.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
