### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves a backdoor program that:
     - Gathers host information during the discovery phase.
     - Uses DNS for C2 (Command and Control) communication.
     - Establishes communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.
     - Parses the returned data to extract commands.
     - Distributes the commands through the `taskHandler` function.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely for the backdoor program to use DNS for C2 communication without establishing communication using DNS tunneling.
     - This implies a simpler form of DNS communication, possibly using standard DNS queries to communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely for the backdoor program to use DNS for C2 communication without establishing communication using DNS tunneling.
     - This implies that the backdoor program will use DNS tunneling to establish a more sophisticated and stealthy form of communication with the C2 server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **DNS Tunneling:**
     - DNS tunneling is a technique where attackers encode data in DNS queries and responses to communicate with a C2 server. This method is often used to bypass network security measures because DNS traffic is typically allowed through firewalls.
     - Given that the question mentions "establishing communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling," it implies a more advanced and stealthy method of communication.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves multiple steps:
       1. Discovery phase (gathering host information).
       2. Using DNS for C2 communication.
       3. Establishing communication with the C2 server using DNS tunneling.
       4. Parsing the returned data to extract commands.
       5. Distributing the commands through the `taskHandler` function.
     - The use of DNS tunneling is a specific and advanced technique that aligns with the sophisticated nature of the attack described.

### Final Answer:
Given the detailed and advanced nature of the attack sequence described, it is more plausible that the backdoor program will use DNS tunneling to establish communication with the C2 server rather than a simpler form of DNS communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
