### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker extracts Chrome passwords by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using `libchrome.exe`.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the spyware will automatically collect data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Tactic: Credential Access**
     - The initial TTP involves extracting Chrome passwords, which is a common technique under the Credential Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Tactic: Collection**
     - Collecting data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images falls under the Collection tactic.
   - **Tactic: Exfiltration**
     - The final step in the sequence is exfiltration, which involves sending the collected data to the attacker.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Initial TTP (Credential Access):**
     - Extracting Chrome passwords is a common initial step in many attacks to gain access to user credentials.
   - **Subsequent TTPs (Collection):**
     - Collecting data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images is a logical next step for a spyware to gather more comprehensive information about the victim.
   - **Final TTP (Exfiltration):**
     - Exfiltration is the final step where the collected data is sent to the attacker.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical progression from Credential Access to Collection and then to Exfiltration, it is plausible that the spyware would automatically collect additional data (from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images) before exfiltration.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
