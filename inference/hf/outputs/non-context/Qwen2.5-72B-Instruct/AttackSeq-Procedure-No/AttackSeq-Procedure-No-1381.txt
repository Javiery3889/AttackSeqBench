### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Lateral movement using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and custom web shells.
     - Gathering information on services using system service discovery.
     - Obtaining credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) and trojanized KeePass binaries.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells to move laterally within the network. This is a common technique for gaining access to additional systems and resources.
   - **Gathering Information on Services:**
     - System service discovery is a technique used to identify running services and their configurations. This information can be valuable for further exploitation.
   - **Obtaining Credentials:**
     - Process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries are techniques used to extract credentials. LSASS memory dumping is a well-known method for extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, and other sensitive information. Trojanized KeePass binaries can be used to steal stored credentials from password managers.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - Typically, an attacker would first move laterally to gain access to more systems.
     - Once access is gained, the attacker would likely gather information on the services running on the compromised systems to understand the environment better.
     - After gathering this information, the attacker would then focus on obtaining credentials to further their access and control.
   - **Timing:**
     - It is logical to gather information on services before attempting to obtain credentials. This is because the information on services can help identify which systems or processes are most valuable to target for credential extraction.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs, it is more plausible that FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery after moving laterally and before obtaining credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

### Final Answer: B: No
