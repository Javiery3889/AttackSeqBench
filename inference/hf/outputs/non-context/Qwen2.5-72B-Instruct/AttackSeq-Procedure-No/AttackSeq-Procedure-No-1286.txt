### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Turla operators.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing a hidden foothold in infected networks.
     - Using the foothold to search other computers and store stolen information.
     - Setting auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts to collect data.
     - Updating command and control (C2) servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing a Hidden Foothold:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where attackers gain access to a network and remain undetected.
   - **Searching Other Computers and Storing Stolen Information:**
     - Once inside the network, attackers often search for valuable data and store it for exfiltration.
   - **Setting Auto-Forward Rules on Victim's E-Mail Accounts:**
     - This technique is used to intercept and collect sensitive information, such as emails, which can provide additional intelligence and access to other systems.
   - **Updating Command and Control Servers:**
     - Maintaining control over infected systems often involves updating C2 servers to ensure continued communication and control.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Turla.
   - Turla is known for sophisticated and long-term operations, which often involve multiple stages of data collection and maintaining persistent access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the detailed and logical sequence of TTPs described, it is highly likely that Turla operators would follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
