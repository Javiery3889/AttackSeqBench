### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to download and install an MSI package.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that client software vulnerabilities, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158, will be exploited for execution instead of using malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Method:**
     - Tropic Trooper uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to gain initial access. This is a known technique where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code.
   - **Exploitation of Client Software Vulnerabilities:**
     - The question mentions the possibility of exploiting client software vulnerabilities, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158, for execution.
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Word that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. However, this vulnerability is typically used to gain initial access, not as a secondary method after initial access has already been achieved.
   - **Malicious Documents Hosting the Backdoor's Dropper:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use malicious documents to deliver and execute the backdoor's dropper. This is a common technique because it allows for the persistence and further propagation of the malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Tropic Trooper has already gained initial access using the Equation Editor vulnerability, it is less likely that they would switch to exploiting another client software vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158 for execution.
   - Instead, it is more plausible that they would use the initial access to deliver and execute the backdoor's dropper through malicious documents, which is a more straightforward and effective method for maintaining control and furthering the attack.

### Final Answer: B: No
