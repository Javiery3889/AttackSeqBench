### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the MuddyWater APT group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Conducting spear-phishing attacks from February to April 2019 for initial access.
     2. Utilizing AnyDesk remote desktop application to gain further access.
     3. Employing a server-based script (web.py) to process client requests and deliver next-stage payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing for Initial Access:**
     - MuddyWater is known for using spear-phishing as an initial access vector. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Utilizing AnyDesk:**
     - AnyDesk is a legitimate remote desktop application that can be used by attackers to maintain persistence and gain remote access to compromised systems. MuddyWater has been known to use legitimate remote access tools to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection.
   - **Employing web.py:**
     - The use of a server-based script like web.py to process client requests and deliver next-stage payloads is a common technique in post-compromise activities. This script can act as a command and control (C2) server, facilitating the delivery of additional malware or maintaining communication with the compromised network.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known MuddyWater TTPs. The group often uses a combination of initial access vectors (like spear-phishing), remote access tools (like AnyDesk), and custom scripts (like web.py) to achieve their objectives.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
