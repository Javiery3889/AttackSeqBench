### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves an MSI package achieving persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that a malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via LNK File:**
     - The MSI package achieves persistence by creating an LNK file that runs at Windows startup. This is a common technique to ensure that the malware is executed every time the system starts.
   - **Malicious XLS Attachment:**
     - The question mentions a malicious XLS attachment. XLS files can contain VB macros, which are often used to execute malicious code.
   - **Silent Download of Malicious MSI:**
     - A VB macro in an XLS file can be used to download and execute a malicious MSI package. This is a plausible sequence because:
       - The macro can be triggered when the XLS file is opened.
       - The macro can download the MSI package from a remote server.
       - The macro can then execute the MSI package to install the malware.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - The initial persistence mechanism (LNK file) ensures the malware runs at startup.
     - The malicious XLS attachment with a VB macro can be used to download and execute the MSI package, which is a common method for distributing malware.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
