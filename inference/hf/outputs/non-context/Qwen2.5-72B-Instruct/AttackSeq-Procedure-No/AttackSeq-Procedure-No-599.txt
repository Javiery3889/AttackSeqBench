### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Sednit group's malware.
   - The sequence in question is: 
     1. Gathering process and hard drive information using the AutoIt downloader during the Discovery phase.
     2. Launching campaigns with malicious documents containing VBA macros to establish initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network to aid in further actions.
     - Using an AutoIt downloader to gather process and hard drive information is a plausible action during the Discovery phase.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Initial Access phase involves the adversary gaining entry into the target network.
     - Malicious documents containing VBA macros are a common method for establishing initial access, often through phishing emails or other social engineering techniques.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - It is logical for an adversary to first gather information about the target system (Discovery) before attempting to establish initial access.
     - However, the question implies that the Discovery phase (using the AutoIt downloader) happens only before the Initial Access phase (using VBA macros).
     - In practice, the Sednit group and other sophisticated adversaries often use a combination of techniques, and the Discovery phase can occur concurrently with or after the Initial Access phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of sophisticated adversaries like the Sednit group, it is unlikely that the Discovery phase using the AutoIt downloader would occur only before the Initial Access phase using VBA macros. The two phases can overlap, and the adversary may use multiple techniques simultaneously.

**Final Answer: B: No**
