### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Charming Kitten.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Conducting reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages.
     - Gathering sensitive information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication.
     - Acquiring infrastructures by developing phishing sites.
     - Leveraging these infrastructures to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Charming Kitten will develop phishing sites only after gaining initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.
     - This sequence implies that the development of phishing sites is a subsequent step after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Charming Kitten will not develop phishing sites only after gaining initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.
     - This implies that the development of phishing sites can occur before or concurrently with the initial access phase.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - Charming Kitten typically starts with reconnaissance, using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather sensitive information.
     - This information is crucial for gaining initial access, often through credential-stealing attacks.
   - **Developing Phishing Sites:**
     - Developing phishing sites is a common technique used to gather credentials and other sensitive information.
     - Phishing sites can be developed before or during the initial access phase to facilitate the credential-stealing process.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - It is more plausible that Charming Kitten would develop phishing sites as part of the reconnaissance and initial access phase to gather credentials and facilitate the attack.
     - Developing phishing sites only after gaining initial access would be less efficient and less common in typical attack sequences.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
