### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using social engineering in malicious documents to trick victims into enabling macros.
     2. Creating a pipe to enable inter-process communication.
     3. Achieving persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Social Engineering and Macros:**
     - This is a common initial attack vector. Attackers often use social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros in malicious documents, which then execute the payload.
   - **Creating a Pipe for Inter-Process Communication:**
     - Creating a pipe is a technique used to facilitate communication between different processes. This can be part of a more sophisticated attack where the attacker needs to coordinate multiple components or stages of the attack.
   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Adding script paths to the task scheduler is a common method for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malicious script runs automatically at system startup or at regular intervals.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible:
     1. **Initial Compromise:** The attacker uses social engineering to get the victim to enable macros, which then executes the initial payload.
     2. **Inter-Process Communication:** The attacker may create a pipe to facilitate communication between different components of the malware, such as a dropper and a payload, or to coordinate actions between different processes.
     3. **Persistence:** Once the initial payload is executed and the necessary communication channels are established, the attacker can then set up persistence by adding script paths to the task scheduler.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common sequence of TTPs described, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
