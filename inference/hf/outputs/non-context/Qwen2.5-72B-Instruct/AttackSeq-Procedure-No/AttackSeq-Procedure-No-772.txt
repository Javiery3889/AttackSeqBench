### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat group Tortoiseshell.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing a reconnaissance tool (`bird.exe`) to perform discovery.
     - Gaining initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from `hiremilitaryheroes[.]com`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Conducting pre-compromise web searches for victim information is a common tactic in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. This phase involves gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack.
     - Given that Tortoiseshell used a reconnaissance tool (`bird.exe`) to perform discovery, it is highly likely that they also conducted web searches to gather additional information about the target before executing the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that Tortoiseshell did not conduct any pre-compromise web searches for victim information.
     - This is less likely because thorough reconnaissance is a critical step in planning a successful attack. Without prior information, the attack might be less effective or more easily detected.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common practices in the reconnaissance phase and the use of a reconnaissance tool, it is highly likely that Tortoiseshell conducted pre-compromise web searches for victim information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
