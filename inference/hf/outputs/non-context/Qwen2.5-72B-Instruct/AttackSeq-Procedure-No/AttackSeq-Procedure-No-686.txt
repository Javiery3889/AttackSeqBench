### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers have established contact with C2 (Command and Control) servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Server Usage:**
     - C2 servers are typically used for maintaining control over compromised systems and for exfiltrating data. They provide a centralized point for attackers to manage their operations and receive stolen data.
   - **FTP and SMTP Protocols:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) are common protocols used for file transfer and email, respectively. While they can be used for exfiltration, they are less stealthy and more likely to be monitored by network security systems.
   - **Likelihood of Exfiltration:**
     - Given that the attackers have already established a C2 channel, it is more likely that they will use this channel for exfiltration. C2 channels are designed to be stealthy and resilient, making them a preferred method for data exfiltration.
     - Using FTP or SMTP for exfiltration would increase the risk of detection, as these protocols are more likely to be monitored and logged by network security systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is less likely that the attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
