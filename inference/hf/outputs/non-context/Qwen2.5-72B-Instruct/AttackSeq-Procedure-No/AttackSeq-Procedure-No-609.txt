### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Hidden Cobra (a known threat actor) used the Bankshot malware implant to compromise a target via a malicious domain that resembled a cryptocurrency-lending platform.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the group would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.
     - This is a plausible sequence because:
       - **Resource Development Phase:** Hidden Cobra used a malicious domain to distribute the Bankshot implant. This is a common initial access technique.
       - **Reconnaissance Phase:** Once the implant is in place, it is common for threat actors to use the malware to gather information about the victim organization. This information can include network topology, user credentials, and other valuable data that can be used to further the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Hidden Cobra would not use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It is unusual for threat actors to compromise a target and then not use the initial access to gather information. The primary purpose of initial access is often to facilitate further stages of the attack, including reconnaissance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Hidden Cobra would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
