### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Defense evasion techniques (process injection and deobfuscation).
     - Data collection and archiving using a custom storage file format.
     - Process discovery and system time discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - Process injection and deobfuscation are common techniques used to evade detection and maintain persistence. These are typically used early in the attack to establish a foothold and avoid being detected by security software.
   - **Data Collection and Archiving:**
     - After gaining access and evading defenses, the next logical step is to collect and exfiltrate data. Using a custom storage file format for archiving collected data is a plausible step to ensure the data is organized and can be efficiently exfiltrated.
   - **Process Discovery and System Time Discovery:**
     - These techniques are often used to gather information about the system and its processes, which can help the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions. However, they are typically used earlier in the attack to gather initial intelligence rather than after data collection and archiving.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Steps:**
     - The attacker uses process injection and deobfuscation to evade defenses and establish a foothold.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Once the foothold is established, the attacker collects data and archives it using a custom storage file format.
   - **Information Gathering:**
     - Process discovery and system time discovery are typically used to gather initial intelligence about the system, which is more likely to occur before data collection and archiving.

Given this reasoning, it is less likely that the attacker would perform process discovery and system time discovery after archiving the collected data. These steps are more likely to be part of the initial reconnaissance phase.
