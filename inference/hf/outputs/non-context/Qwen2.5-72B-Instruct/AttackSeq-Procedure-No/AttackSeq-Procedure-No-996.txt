### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is achieved through trojanized installation files of well-known applications.
   - The question then asks if PROMETHIUM is likely to execute commands on Azure virtual machines using the VM agent before creating a service for persistence that launches the C2 contact module upon startup.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through trojanized installation files of well-known applications. This is a common technique used by various threat actors to gain a foothold in a target network.
   - **Execution on Azure VMs:**
     - The question mentions executing commands on Azure virtual machines using the VM agent. This is a specific and advanced technique that involves interacting with cloud infrastructure.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a service for persistence that launches the C2 (Command and Control) contact module upon startup is a common technique to ensure the attacker maintains access to the compromised system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Persistence:**
     - The initial access through trojanized installation files and the creation of a service for persistence are both plausible and commonly used techniques in cyber attacks.
   - **Execution on Azure VMs:**
     - Executing commands on Azure virtual machines using the VM agent is a more advanced and specific technique. It suggests that the attacker has already gained significant access and is now leveraging cloud infrastructure to further their objectives.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gaining initial access, an advanced threat actor like PROMETHIUM might indeed use the VM agent to execute commands on Azure VMs to further their attack. This could be part of a broader campaign to maintain persistence and establish a more robust foothold in the target environment.
