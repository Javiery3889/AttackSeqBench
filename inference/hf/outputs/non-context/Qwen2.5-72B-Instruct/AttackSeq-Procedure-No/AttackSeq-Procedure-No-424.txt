### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method: phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - It then asks if it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious Word documents are a common initial access vector. When a user opens the document, it can trigger the execution of malicious code, often through macros or embedded objects.
   - **COM Object Execution:**
     - COM (Component Object Model) objects are often used by malware to execute system queries and perform various actions. Malware can use COM objects to gather system information, which is a typical reconnaissance step.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - After gaining initial access, malware often gathers system information to determine the environment and plan further actions. This is a common step in the attack lifecycle.
   - **Downloading Payloads:**
     - Once the system information is gathered, the malware may download additional payloads. Ursnif and GandCrab are known malware families that can be downloaded as secondary payloads.
   - **Ursnif and GandCrab:**
     - Ursnif is a banking trojan that steals sensitive information, and GandCrab is a ransomware family. Both are known to be distributed through various methods, including phishing emails and other initial access vectors.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence described, it is plausible that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. This aligns with the typical behavior of malware following initial access through phishing.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
