### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Sednit group using a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Gaining initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents using VBA macros.
     2. Leveraging Scheduled Tasks through a Group Policy Object (GPO) to execute malware at a predetermined time.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Email Attachments with VBA Macros:**
     - Sednit (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Sofacy) is known for using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, often containing VBA macros. This is a common initial access technique for this group.
   - **Leveraging Scheduled Tasks through GPO:**
     - Once initial access is gained, Sednit has been known to use various persistence mechanisms to maintain access to the compromised system. One such mechanism is the use of Scheduled Tasks.
     - Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can be used to deploy Scheduled Tasks across multiple systems in a domain, which is a sophisticated and effective method for ensuring persistence and maintaining control over the network.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Sednit often uses a combination of initial access techniques followed by sophisticated persistence mechanisms to maintain long-term access to the target network.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the known TTPs of the Sednit group and the plausibility of the described sequence, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
