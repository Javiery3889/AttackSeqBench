### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial attack vector where emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment are sent. The attachment contains a link to ENVYSCOUT, which is a known malware.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS (Virtual Private Server) infrastructure to host malware C2 (Command and Control) servers by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through phishing emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT. This is a common tactic used by adversaries to gain a foothold in a target network.
   - **Development of VPS Infrastructure:**
     - After gaining initial access, adversaries often need to establish a persistent and reliable C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised systems.
     - Using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts is a plausible method to achieve this. Compromised webservers can provide a low-cost and often less traceable way to host C2 infrastructure.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
       1. Initial access via phishing emails.
       2. Use of ENVYSCOUT to establish a foothold.
       3. Development of VPS infrastructure using compromised webservers to host C2 scripts.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical progression and the common tactics used by adversaries, it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
