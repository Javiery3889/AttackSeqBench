### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing malicious MS Office documents.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers would leverage the Microsoft Graph API to perform various actions across Azure and M365 environments before disabling security controls.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Phishing:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents are a common initial access vector. Once a victim opens the document and enables macros, the malware can execute and provide the attacker with a foothold in the network.
   - **Leveraging Microsoft Graph API:**
     - The Microsoft Graph API is a powerful tool that provides access to a wide range of Microsoft 365 and Azure services. Attackers can use it to perform various actions, such as reading emails, accessing files, and managing user accounts.
   - **Disabling Security Controls:**
     - Disabling security controls is a common post-compromise activity to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This can include disabling antivirus software, firewalls, and other security mechanisms.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is plausible that attackers would use the Microsoft Graph API to move laterally and perform actions across the environment. This can help them gather more information, escalate privileges, and prepare for further actions.
     - Disabling security controls is a logical next step to ensure that the attacker's activities are not detected and to maintain long-term access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events described, it is indeed likely that attackers would leverage the Microsoft Graph API to perform various actions across Azure and M365 environments before disabling security controls.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
