### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Persistence:** Ensured through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks.
     - **Techniques:** Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.
   - The question asks whether Dexphot is likely to use CVE-2015-4902 to bypass security features as part of its defense evasion tactics.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Techniques:**
     - **Scheduled Task:** This technique is used to ensure that the malware runs at specific intervals or upon certain system events.
     - **Signed Binary Proxy Execution:** This technique involves using legitimate, signed binaries to execute malicious code, which can help evade detection by security software.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - **CVE-2015-4902:** This is a vulnerability in the Windows Kernel that can be exploited to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and execute code with elevated privileges.
   - **Dexphot Malware:**
     - Dexphot is known for its sophisticated persistence mechanisms and its ability to evade detection.
     - It has been observed using various techniques to maintain persistence and avoid detection, including the use of signed binaries and scheduled tasks.
     - However, the specific use of CVE-2015-4902 is not a well-documented or common technique associated with Dexphot.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While Dexphot is known for its advanced persistence and evasion techniques, the use of CVE-2015-4902 is not a typical or well-documented part of its arsenal.
   - The question asks if it is likely to use this specific vulnerability, and based on the known behavior of Dexphot, it is not a common or expected technique.

### Final Answer: B: No
