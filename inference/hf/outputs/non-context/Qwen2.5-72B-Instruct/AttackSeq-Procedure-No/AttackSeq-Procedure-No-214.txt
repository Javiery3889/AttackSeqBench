### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Milestone backdoor.
   - The backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - The question then asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to a specific location and creating a service in the registry. This is a common technique used by malware to maintain access to the system.
   - **Certificate Installation:**
     - Installing a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher is a technique often used to facilitate further malicious activities, such as signing malicious code or intercepting secure communications.
   - **System Information Discovery and Screen Capture:**
     - These are typical post-exploitation activities where the attacker gathers information about the system and captures screen content to understand the environment and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - After ensuring persistence, it is plausible for an advanced threat actor like Deep Panda to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store. This would allow the malware to sign its components and potentially bypass security checks.
     - Installing a certificate as a root CA and Trusted Publisher would also help in maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection by security software.
     - Once the certificate is installed, the malware can proceed with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities, which are common post-exploitation activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, it is likely that Deep Panda would install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
