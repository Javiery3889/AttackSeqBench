### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Derusbi malware.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection.
     2. Binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server.
     3. Gathering system information about the victim host.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Using the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to modify the system's global call table and evade detection:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to gain rootkit capabilities and hide its presence on the system. It allows the malware to intercept and manipulate system calls, making it harder to detect.
   - **Step 2: Binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server:**
     - Once the malware has established a foothold and evaded detection, it often needs to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
   - **Step 3: Gathering system information about the victim host:**
     - Before initiating communication with the C2 server, it is often more logical for the malware to gather system information to understand the environment it is operating in. This information can be used to tailor the attack or to report back to the C2 server.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the malware binds to a raw socket and initiates communication with the C2 server before gathering system information.
   - However, it is more common and logical for malware to gather system information first to understand the environment and then communicate with the C2 server.

### Final Answer:
B: No
