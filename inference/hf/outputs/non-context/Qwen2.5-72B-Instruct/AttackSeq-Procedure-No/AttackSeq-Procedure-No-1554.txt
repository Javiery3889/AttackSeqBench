### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would copy data from social media sites to impersonate targeted individuals before gaining initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
     1. Copy data from social media sites to impersonate targeted individuals.
     2. Gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Impersonating individuals by copying data from social media can be a common tactic in social engineering and spear phishing attacks. This data can be used to make the spear phishing emails more convincing.
     - Using OLE2 format documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails is a known method for gaining initial access. The combination of social media data and spear phishing can increase the likelihood of success.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - While it is possible that the attackers might not use this specific sequence, it is not uncommon for sophisticated attackers to gather information from social media to enhance their spear phishing efforts.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and effective method for gaining initial access. Social media data can be used to create more convincing spear phishing emails, and OLE2 format documents with embedded links are a known method for delivering malware.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would use this sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
