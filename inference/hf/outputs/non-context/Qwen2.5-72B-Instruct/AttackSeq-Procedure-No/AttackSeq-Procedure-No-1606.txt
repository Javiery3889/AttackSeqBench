### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the SideCopy malware.
   - The initial access is gained through malicious LNK files.
   - The payload is delivered via a convoluted infection chain.
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SideCopy Malware:**
     - SideCopy is known for its sophisticated techniques, including the use of malicious LNK files and complex infection chains.
     - It often aims to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
   - **njRAT Malware:**
     - njRAT is a well-known remote access trojan (RAT) that is often used for credential harvesting and other malicious activities.
   - **Capture Mouse Movements and API Hooking:**
     - Capturing mouse movements and performing API hooking are techniques that can be used for various purposes, such as keylogging, screen capturing, and evading detection.
     - These techniques are more commonly associated with the initial stages of an attack to gather information and maintain persistence.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - Given the sophistication of SideCopy, it is plausible that it would use techniques like capturing mouse movements and API hooking to gather information and maintain control before deploying njRAT.
     - However, the primary goal of SideCopy in this context is to deliver njRAT for credential harvesting, which is a more direct and specific task.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - While SideCopy is capable of using advanced techniques, the question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs before deploying njRAT for credential harvesting.
   - Given the focus on credential harvesting, it is less likely that SideCopy would perform mouse movement capture or API hooking as a necessary step before deploying njRAT.

**Final Answer: B: No**
