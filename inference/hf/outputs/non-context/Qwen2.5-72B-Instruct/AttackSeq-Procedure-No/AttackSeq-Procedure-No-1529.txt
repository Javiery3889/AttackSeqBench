### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The first TTP mentioned is the scheduling of periodic execution of a script (`install.vbs`), which is a common technique for achieving persistence.
   - The second TTP involves the deletion of files (`versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs`) using another script (`stopedge.bat`), which is a technique for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Scheduling `install.vbs`):**
     - Scheduling the periodic execution of a script is a common technique used by attackers to ensure that their malicious code runs repeatedly, even if the system is restarted. This is typically done using techniques like Task Scheduling (MITRE ATT&CK T1053) or Registry Run Keys (T1060).
   - **Defense Evasion (Deleting `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs`):**
     - Deleting files that might be used for detection or analysis is a common defense evasion technique. This can help the attacker avoid leaving traces that could be used to identify or remove the malware. Techniques like File Deletion (T1107) and Indicator Removal on Host (T1070) are relevant here.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - After establishing persistence, it is logical for an attacker to take steps to evade detection and maintain a low profile. Deleting files that could be used to identify the malware or its activities is a common next step.
   - **Contextual Fit:**
     - The use of `stopedge.bat` to delete `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs` fits well into the context of defense evasion. These files might be auxiliary scripts or logs that could be used to trace the attacker's activities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of establishing persistence and then taking steps to evade detection, it is plausible that `stopedge.bat` would be used to delete files like `versioninfo.bat` and `update.vbs`.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
