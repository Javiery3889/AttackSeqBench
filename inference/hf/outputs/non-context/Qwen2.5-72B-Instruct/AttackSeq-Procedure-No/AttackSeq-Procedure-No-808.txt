### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the WinDealer malware:
     - Collects and processes data from various sources (USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin contents, and SNS application folders).
     - Stores the processed data in ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use port-knocking methods to authenticate itself and establish a connection to the C2 server before exfiltrating the data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port-Knocking:**
     - Port-knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. Once the correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port(s).
     - Port-knocking is typically used to hide services from unauthorized access and is not a common method for malware to establish a C2 connection.
   - **Common C2 Techniques:**
     - Malware often uses more straightforward methods to establish a C2 connection, such as:
       - Direct HTTP/HTTPS requests.
       - DNS tunneling.
       - ICMP (ping) tunneling.
       - Using legitimate protocols and services to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **Context of WinDealer:**
     - WinDealer is known for its data collection and exfiltration capabilities. It is more likely to use common and effective methods to establish a C2 connection rather than a less common and more complex method like port-knocking.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware and the specific context of WinDealer, it is less likely that the malware would use port-knocking to authenticate and establish a connection to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
