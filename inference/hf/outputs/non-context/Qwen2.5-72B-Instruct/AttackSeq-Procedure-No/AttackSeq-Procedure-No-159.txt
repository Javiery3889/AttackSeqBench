### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Identifying systems of interest.
     - Using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Identifying Systems of Interest:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks, where the attacker identifies potential targets within the network.
   - **Using Remote Command Execution Scripts:**
     - This technique is used to execute commands on remote systems, often to gain further access or to perform additional actions.
   - **Launching Compression Tools for Staging Data:**
     - This is a data exfiltration technique where the attacker compresses data to make it easier to transfer out of the network.
   - **Conducting Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Internal reconnaissance is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle where the attacker maps out the network to understand its structure, identify additional targets, and plan further actions.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - APT10, like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, typically follows a structured and methodical approach to their attacks.
   - After identifying systems of interest and staging data for exfiltration, it is highly likely that APT10 would conduct internal reconnaissance to:
     - Gain a deeper understanding of the network topology.
     - Identify additional systems of interest.
     - Plan further stages of the attack, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.
   - Common Windows tools (e.g., `net view`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`) and open-source pentesting tools (e.g., Nmap, Metasploit) are often used for this purpose.

### Final Answer:
