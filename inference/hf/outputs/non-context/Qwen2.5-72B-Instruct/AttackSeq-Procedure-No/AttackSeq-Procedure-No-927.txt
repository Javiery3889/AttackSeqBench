### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Emissary Panda group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server over HTTPS.
     2. Performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit.
     3. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HyperBro Backdoor and C2 Communication:**
     - HyperBro is a known backdoor used by Emissary Panda to establish a persistent connection with a C2 server. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a technique used to move through a network to access additional systems and resources. Using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit (a known exploit for the SMB protocol) is a plausible method for lateral movement.
   - **Exploiting Microsoft SharePoint:**
     - After gaining access to additional systems, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence is a logical next step. Webshells can provide long-term access to the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Access:** Using the HyperBro backdoor to establish a C2 connection.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** Using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit to move through the network.
     3. **Persistence:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for long-term access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns and techniques used by advanced threat actors like Emissary Panda.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
