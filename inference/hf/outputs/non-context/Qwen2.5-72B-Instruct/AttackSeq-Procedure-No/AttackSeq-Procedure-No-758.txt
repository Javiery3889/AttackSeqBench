### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial reconnaissance phase where the attacker gathers system and network information.
   - It then asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for Command and Control (C2) before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - Gathering system and network information such as network adapter details, computer name, and IP address is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Communication with Google Servers:**
     - The question specifically mentions communication with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2. This is unusual because:
       - **Google's Infrastructure:** Google's servers are typically used for legitimate services, and using them for C2 would be highly suspicious and likely to be detected and blocked.
       - **Jabber/XMPP Protocol:** While Jabber/XMPP is a legitimate protocol used for instant messaging, it is not a common choice for C2 communication in advanced malware. More common protocols for C2 include HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding is a common technique used to avoid detection. However, the sequence of using Google servers for C2 before exfiltration is less plausible.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The initial reconnaissance phase is a standard and plausible step.
   - **C2 Communication:** Using Google servers for C2 is highly unusual and would likely be detected. Advanced malware typically uses more stealthy and less detectable methods for C2.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating data with Base64 encoding is a common and plausible step, but the sequence of using Google servers for C2 before exfiltration is not typical.
