### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SideCopy group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the Exfiltration phase.
     2. Specifically targeting access credentials from Indian government employees during the Credential Access phase using njRAT.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases is a plausible technique. Kavach is an authentication system used by the Indian government, and exfiltrating its databases would provide valuable credentials.
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - Using njRAT (a remote access trojan) to target access credentials from Indian government employees is also plausible. njRAT is known for its ability to steal credentials and other sensitive information.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question suggests that the exfiltration of Kavach databases happens first, followed by the use of njRAT to target credentials. This sequence is logical because the exfiltrated databases could provide the initial set of credentials, which can then be used to gain further access and target more specific credentials using njRAT.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Exfiltration of Kavach Databases:**
     - The use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach databases is a sophisticated and targeted approach. This suggests that the attackers have a specific interest in Indian government credentials.
   - **Use of njRAT for Credential Access:**
     - njRAT is a well-known tool for credential theft and remote access. Using it to target Indian government employees after exfiltrating Kavach databases aligns with the goal of gaining deeper access and more specific credentials.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the typical attack patterns of advanced threat actors. Exfiltrating initial credentials and then using them to gain further access is a common strategy.
