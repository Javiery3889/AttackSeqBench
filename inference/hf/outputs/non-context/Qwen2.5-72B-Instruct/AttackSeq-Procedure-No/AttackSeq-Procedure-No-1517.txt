### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltration of collected data over an established C&C (Command and Control) channel.
     - Use of a backdoor to collect detailed system information (file manipulation, screenshots, network details).
     - Communication with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol to send a 'Start conversation' message.
     - Receiving a 'Get Victim Information' message from the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Collected Data:**
     - This is a common step in the attack lifecycle where the attacker sends the stolen data to a remote server.
   - **Use of Backdoor for Detailed System Information:**
     - After exfiltration, it is plausible that the attacker would use the backdoor to gather more detailed information about the system. This is often done to understand the environment better and plan further actions.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The use of an encrypted protocol to send a 'Start conversation' message and receive a 'Get Victim Information' message is a typical part of maintaining and using a C&C channel. This ensures that the communication is secure and the attacker can receive further instructions or data.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Exfiltration:** The initial data is sent to the C&C server.
     2. **Backdoor Use:** The attacker uses the backdoor to gather more detailed information.
     3. **C&C Communication:** The attacker communicates with the C&C server to send and receive messages, ensuring the channel remains active and secure.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical flow and common practices in cyber attacks, the sequence described is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
