### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat group (TG1021).
   - The initial access is gained by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - The question asks if it is more likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets instead.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Exploiting IIS Servers:**
     - This method involves directly targeting and exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
     - The use of deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability suggests a highly targeted and sophisticated approach.
   - **Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - Watering hole attacks involve compromising a website that the target frequently visits, with the goal of infecting the target when they visit the site.
     - This method is also sophisticated and can be used to deliver zero-day exploits.
   - **Zero-Day Exploits:**
     - Both methods (exploiting IIS servers and watering hole attacks) can use zero-day exploits, which are previously unknown vulnerabilities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access via IIS Servers:**
     - This method is direct and can be more efficient if the target has a known vulnerability in their IIS servers.
     - It is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to gain initial access.
   - **Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - While watering hole attacks are also sophisticated, they require the attacker to identify and compromise a frequently visited website.
     - This method can be more time-consuming and may not always be as direct as exploiting a known vulnerability in the target's infrastructure.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the description of the initial access method (exploiting IIS servers with deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability), it is more likely that TG1021 used this direct and efficient method to gain initial access.
   - Watering hole attacks, while possible, are less likely to be the primary method in this scenario.

### Final Answer: B: No
