### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a PHP script gathers system profile information and stores it in a MySQL database during the discovery phase.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the C2 (Command and Control) MySQL database will contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase is a critical part of the attack lifecycle where the attacker gathers information about the target environment. This includes identifying system configurations, network topology, and other relevant details.
     - The PHP script is described as gathering system profile information and storing it in the MySQL database during this phase.
   - **C2 MySQL Database:**
     - The C2 MySQL database is used to store information that the attacker needs to manage and control the compromised systems.
     - If the PHP script is storing system profile information in the MySQL database during the discovery phase, it implies that the database will contain this information after the discovery phase has begun.
   - **Before the Discovery Phase:**
     - Before the discovery phase, the attacker would not have gathered any system profile information, so the C2 MySQL database would not contain tables describing the machines.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the PHP script is storing system profile information in the MySQL database during the discovery phase, it is not likely that the C2 MySQL database will contain tables describing machines only before the discovery phase.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
