### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question is about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the SUNBURST and SUNSPOT attacks.
   - Specifically, it asks whether SUNSPOT, after modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor, will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **SUNSPOT**: This is the malware that was used to modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.
   - **SUNBURST**: This is the backdoor that was injected into the Orion software.
   - **Discovery Tactic**: This is a phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework where the attacker attempts to gather information about the system and network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SUNSPOT** is primarily known for its role in the initial compromise and the injection of the SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion software. Its main function is to ensure that the backdoor is successfully integrated into the build process.
   - **SUNBURST** is the backdoor that, once deployed, performs various actions, including discovery, persistence, and data exfiltration.
   - **Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe** is a technique that could be used for discovery, but it is more likely to be performed by the SUNBURST backdoor rather than SUNSPOT. SUNSPOT's role is more focused on the initial compromise and injection, not on the subsequent discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **SUNSPOT** is responsible for the initial compromise and injection of the SUNBURST backdoor.
   - **SUNBURST** is the backdoor that, once active, would perform discovery activities, including monitoring processes.
   - Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe is a discovery technique that would be more relevant to the SUNBURST backdoor's operations rather than SUNSPOT's initial compromise and injection activities.
