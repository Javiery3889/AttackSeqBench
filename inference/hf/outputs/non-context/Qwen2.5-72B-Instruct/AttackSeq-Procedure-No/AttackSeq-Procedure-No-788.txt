### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the Higaisa APT group using a specific sequence of TTPs.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Distributing malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae (CV) or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing.
     2. Compromising legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Distributing Malicious LNK Files via Spear-Phishing:**
     - This is a common TTP used by many APT groups. Spear-phishing is a well-known method for initial access, and using LNK files (shortcuts) to execute malicious payloads is a known technique.
     - This aligns with the initial access phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1566: Spearphishing).

   - **Compromising Legitimate Web Browser Updates:**
     - Compromising legitimate software updates, such as web browser updates, is a more sophisticated and less common TTP. It requires significant resources and access to the software supply chain.
     - This aligns with the supply chain compromise phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework (T1195: Supply Chain Compromise).

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - While both TTPs are known, the sequence described in the question involves a progression from a common initial access method (spear-phishing) to a more advanced and resource-intensive method (supply chain compromise).
   - It is less likely that an APT group would immediately escalate to compromising legitimate web browser updates after a successful spear-phishing campaign. Typically, APT groups use the initial access to establish a foothold and then gradually move to more advanced techniques as needed.

### Final Answer:
B: No
