### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - Using Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks to run commands on other systems.
     - Deploying BlackEnergy’s network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network.
     - Using lateral movement techniques involving dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz for Credential Dumping:**
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool used to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory.
     - This is a common initial step in many attack sequences to gain access to additional credentials.

   - **Impacket for Pass-the-Hash:**
     - Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols.
     - Pass-the-hash (PtH) is a technique where an attacker uses a hashed password to authenticate to a remote system without needing the plaintext password.
     - This is often used after credential dumping to move laterally within a network.

   - **BlackEnergy’s Network Sniffer Module:**
     - BlackEnergy is a multi-component malware that has been used in various cyberattacks.
     - The network sniffer module can capture network traffic, including credentials being transmitted over the network.
     - Deploying a network sniffer after gaining initial access and using PtH is less common because it is more likely to be detected and can be redundant if the attacker already has a large number of credentials from Mimikatz.

   - **Lateral Movement with Dumped Credentials and atexec:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network.
     - Using dumped credentials and tools like atexec (part of Impacket) to run commands on other systems is a common next step after gaining initial access and credentials.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with credential dumping using Mimikatz and then uses Impacket for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - Deploying a network sniffer like BlackEnergy’s module after these steps is less likely because:
     - The attacker already has a significant number of credentials from Mimikatz.
     - Deploying a network sniffer can increase the risk of detection.
     - The primary goal of the attack is to move laterally, which can be achieved with the credentials already obtained.
   - The final step of using lateral movement techniques with dumped credentials and atexec is a logical and common next step.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
