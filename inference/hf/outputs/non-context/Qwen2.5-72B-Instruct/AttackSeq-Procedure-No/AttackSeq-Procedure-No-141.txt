### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability was used for initial access into victim networks.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials only after performing the initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Vulnerability:**
     - The attack group used an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8 to gain initial access. This is a common technique where attackers exploit known vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in the network.
   - **Phishing for Credentials:**
     - Phishing is a technique where attackers trick users into providing sensitive information, such as credentials, often through deceptive emails or websites.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The question specifies that the phishing for credentials occurred "only after performing the initial access."
     - This implies that the attackers first gained access to the network using the vulnerability and then used phishing to gather additional credentials.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Plausible Scenario:**
     - It is plausible that after gaining initial access, the attackers would use phishing to gather more credentials to further their access and control within the network. This is a common tactic in multi-stage attacks.
   - **Alternative Scenario:**
     - It is less likely that the attackers would use phishing to gather credentials before gaining initial access, as they already have a way in through the vulnerability.
