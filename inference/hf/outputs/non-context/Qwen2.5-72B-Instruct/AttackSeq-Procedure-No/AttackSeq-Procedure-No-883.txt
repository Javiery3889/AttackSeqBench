### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Naikon APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses by operating C&C (Command and Control) servers in limited time windows.
     - Utilizing fileless loading techniques.
     - Using HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server.
     - Using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Defenses:**
     - Operating C&C servers in limited time windows is a common technique to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
     - Fileless loading techniques involve executing malware in memory without writing to the disk, which helps evade signature-based detection.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - HTTP and TCP are common protocols used for C&C communication. HTTP is often used because it can blend in with normal web traffic, making it harder to detect.
   - **Using Aria-body Backdoor:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor is known to be used by the Naikon APT group for various purposes, including gathering information about active processes during the discovery phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of the Naikon APT group.
   - The use of limited time windows for C&C server operation, fileless loading techniques, and HTTP/TCP for communication are all plausible and commonly used tactics.
   - The use of the Aria-body backdoor for gathering information about active processes is also a known behavior of the Naikon APT group.
