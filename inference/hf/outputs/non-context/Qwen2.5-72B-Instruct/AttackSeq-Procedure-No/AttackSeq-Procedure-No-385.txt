### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT15.
   - APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
   - RoyalCLI was used to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS):** These are known tools used by APT15 to maintain persistence and gain remote access to the network.
   - **Bypassing Command Prompt Policy Settings:** RoyalCLI is a tool that can be used to execute commands with elevated privileges, bypassing certain security policies.
   - **Mimikatz for Credential Theft:** Mimikatz is a well-known tool used to extract credentials, including domain administrator credentials, from memory. It is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to escalate privileges and move laterally within a network.
   - **Stealing a VPN Certificate:** Once the attackers have domain administrator credentials, they can access and steal sensitive information, including VPN certificates, to maintain long-term access to the network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - APT15 is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and gain deep access to networks.
   - The use of backdoors and tools like RoyalCLI to bypass security policies aligns with their known TTPs.
   - Given that they have already gained a foothold and elevated privileges, it is highly likely that they would use tools like Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
   - Stealing a VPN certificate is a logical next step to ensure they can access the network remotely and maintain long-term access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
