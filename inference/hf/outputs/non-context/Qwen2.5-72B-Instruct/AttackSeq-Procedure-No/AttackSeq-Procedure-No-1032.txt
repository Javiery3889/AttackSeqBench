### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather information about the Active Directory (AD) and network.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if it is likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Using ADFind and port scanning are common techniques in the discovery phase of an attack. ADFind is a tool used to query Active Directory for information, and port scanning helps identify open ports and services on the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a technique used by attackers to move from one system to another within a network. One common method of lateral movement is to abuse credentials or tokens.
   - **AD FS and SAML Tokens:**
     - AD FS is used for federated identity management, and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users across different security domains.
     - If an attacker has compromised an AD FS server, they can potentially abuse SAML tokens to gain access to other systems or services that trust the AD FS server.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attackers have already gathered detailed information about the AD and network, it is logical that they would look for ways to leverage this information to move laterally within the network.
   - Compromising an AD FS server and abusing SAML tokens is a sophisticated and effective method for lateral movement, especially in environments where SAML is used for authentication and authorization.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that attackers would use this technique if they have the necessary access and information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
