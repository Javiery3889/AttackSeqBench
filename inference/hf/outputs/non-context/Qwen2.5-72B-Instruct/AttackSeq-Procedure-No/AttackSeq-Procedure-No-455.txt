### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT-TOCS gained initial access using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts.
   - **Execution:** Shellcode scripts are executed in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employing multi-beacon communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - Using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts is a common technique for gaining initial access and executing malicious code in memory. This is a well-documented TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Execution" and "Initial Access" tactics.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Multi-beacon communication is a technique used to evade detection by establishing multiple communication channels with the command and control (C2) server. This is typically done after gaining initial access and executing the payload to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory after the initial access was gained. However, the question specifically asks if the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory **only after** the attackers employed multi-beacon communication.
     - In a typical attack sequence, the Shellcode script would be executed in memory immediately after the initial access to establish control and then the attackers would employ defense evasion techniques like multi-beacon communication to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs, it is not likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication. The Shellcode script would typically be executed in memory as part of the initial access and execution phase, and multi-beacon communication would be a subsequent step for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: B: No**
