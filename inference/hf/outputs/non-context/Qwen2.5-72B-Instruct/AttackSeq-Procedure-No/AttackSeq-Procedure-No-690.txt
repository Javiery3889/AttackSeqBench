### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers gain initial access to hosts by identifying internal systems and remote control software using tools like Advanced IP Scanner and PushVNC.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will use asynchronous procedure call (APC) injection to execute commands received from the Command and Control (C2) server as part of their defense evasion tactics.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers use tools like Advanced IP Scanner and PushVNC to gain initial access. These tools are commonly used for network scanning and remote control, which aligns with the initial access phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APC injection is a technique used to inject code into the address space of a target process. It is often used for defense evasion to execute malicious code in a way that is less likely to be detected by security software.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Once the attackers have gained initial access, they typically establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised system. Using APC injection to execute commands received from the C2 server is a plausible defense evasion technique.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Using network scanning and remote control tools to identify and gain access to internal systems.
     2. **C2 Communication:** Establishing a C2 channel to maintain control.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Using techniques like APC injection to execute commands from the C2 server in a stealthy manner.
   - APC injection is a sophisticated technique that is often used in advanced attacks to evade detection and maintain persistence.
