### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence in question is:
     1. Steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.
     2. Collect system information.
     3. Probe files as part of the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FamousSparrow** is a known threat actor that has been associated with various TTPs, including the use of phishing emails to gain initial access and subsequent activities to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.
   - **Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails** is a common initial access technique used by many threat actors, including FamousSparrow. This aligns with the first step in the sequence.
   - **Collecting system information** is a typical activity in the Discovery phase, where the attacker gathers information about the system to understand its environment and identify valuable targets.
   - **Probing files** is also a part of the Discovery phase, where the attacker searches for specific files or data that may be of interest.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with the typical attack lifecycle:
     1. **Initial Access**: Steal application access tokens via phishing emails.
     2. **Discovery**: Collect system information and probe files.
   - This sequence is consistent with the known TTPs of FamousSparrow and other similar threat actors.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
