### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Evasion:** Using AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat to evade defenses.
     - **Reconnaissance:** Using tools like Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, and RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3 to enumerate services and authenticate via brute force.
     - **Initial Access:** Using Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, and PushVNC package to identify internal hosts and remotely control software.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evasion (AutoExe1.bat and AutoExe.bat):** These scripts are typically used to evade detection by security software. This is a common first step in many attack sequences to ensure the attacker's tools and actions are not immediately detected.
   - **Reconnaissance (Medusa, Simple SMTP Scanner, Fast SYN Scanner, RealVNC Viewer 5.2.3):** These tools are used to gather information about the target network and systems. Medusa is a brute-force tool, Simple SMTP Scanner and Fast SYN Scanner are used to scan for open ports and services, and RealVNC Viewer is used to test VNC connections.
   - **Initial Access (Advanced IP Scanner, Radmin, PushVNC):** These tools are used to gain initial access to the target network. Advanced IP Scanner is used to identify hosts on the network, Radmin is a remote control tool, and PushVNC is used to establish VNC connections.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Evasion:** The attacker first tries to evade detection.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker then uses various tools to gather information about the target network and systems.
     3. **Initial Access:** Finally, the attacker uses the information gathered during reconnaissance to gain initial access to the network.

   - This sequence is consistent with the typical attack lifecycle, where attackers first try to avoid detection, then gather information, and finally use that information to gain access.
