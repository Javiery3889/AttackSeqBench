### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WINDSHIFT APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
       - Long-term monitoring via social media platforms.
       - Sending benign emails.
       - Using tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com for tracking.
     - **Post-Reconnaissance Phase:**
       - Sending emails mimicking legitimate password recovery pages.
       - Using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages.
       - Employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The described activities (long-term monitoring, sending benign emails, and using tracking tools) are typical of the Reconnaissance phase. This phase is used to gather information and understand the target before launching an attack.
   - **Post-Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The activities mentioned (sending emails mimicking password recovery pages, using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting pages, and employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates) are more aligned with the **Initial Access** and **Command and Control** phases.
     - These activities are used to gain initial access to the target's systems and establish a foothold.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will perform the post-reconnaissance activities **before** the reconnaissance phase.
   - This is not a logical sequence because the reconnaissance phase is the initial phase where the attacker gathers information and prepares for the attack. The activities described in the post-reconnaissance phase are dependent on the information and insights gained during the reconnaissance phase.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that WINDSHIFT APT would send emails mimicking password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages before the reconnaissance phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
