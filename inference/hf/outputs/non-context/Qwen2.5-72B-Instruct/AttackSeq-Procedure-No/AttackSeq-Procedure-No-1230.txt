### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus group.
   - The group established command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6).
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group then engaged in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and encrypting them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C&C Communication:**
     - The use of backdoor malware to establish C&C communication is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations. This allows the attackers to maintain persistent access to the victim's network and execute commands remotely.
   - **Double-Extortion Ransomware:**
     - Double-extortion ransomware is a tactic where attackers exfiltrate sensitive data before encrypting it. This adds an additional layer of pressure on the victims to pay the ransom, as they not only lose access to their data but also face the threat of data exposure.
   - **Lazarus Group's TTPs:**
     - The Lazarus group is known for a variety of sophisticated cyberattacks, including ransomware operations. They have been linked to several high-profile attacks, such as the WannaCry ransomware outbreak.
     - Given their history of using advanced TTPs and their capability to execute complex operations, it is plausible that they could engage in double-extortion ransomware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the established C&C communication and the known capabilities of the Lazarus group, it is likely that they could engage in double-extortion ransomware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
