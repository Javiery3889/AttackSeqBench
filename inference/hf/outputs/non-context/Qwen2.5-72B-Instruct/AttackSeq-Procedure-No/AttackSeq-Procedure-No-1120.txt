### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of the MS Exchange vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to gain initial access.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the attackers would use the Winlogon Helper DLL to establish persistence before stealing domain authentication credentials for lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2021-26855 to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** Using the Winlogon Helper DLL to establish persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** Stealing domain authentication credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using the stolen credentials for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (CVE-2021-26855):** This is a known vulnerability in MS Exchange that allows attackers to gain initial access to the network. This step is plausible and aligns with the attack sequence.
   - **Persistence (Winlogon Helper DLL):** The Winlogon Helper DLL is a technique used to establish persistence by loading a malicious DLL during the Windows logon process. This is a common method for maintaining access to a compromised system.
   - **Credential Access (Stealing Domain Authentication Credentials):** After gaining initial access and establishing persistence, attackers often seek to steal credentials to facilitate lateral movement. This is a logical next step in the attack sequence.
   - **Lateral Movement (Using Stolen Credentials):** Once the attackers have the domain authentication credentials, they can use them to move laterally within the network, accessing other systems and resources.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and common attack pattern. After gaining initial access, attackers often establish persistence to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system. They then proceed to steal credentials to facilitate further movement within the network.
   - The use of the Winlogon Helper DLL for persistence is a known technique and fits well into this sequence.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
