### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The sequence starts with the use of **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** to obfuscate files or information.
   - The question then asks if Dexphot is likely to ensure persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks, specifically using techniques such as **Scheduled Task** and **Signed Binary Proxy Execution**.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader**: This is a known malware that often uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion**: Obfuscation is a common technique used in the **Defense Evasion** tactic of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Persistence**: Ensuring persistence is a critical step for malware to maintain access to a system over time.
   - **Scheduled Task**: This is a common technique used for persistence, where malware creates a scheduled task to run at specific intervals.
   - **Signed Binary Proxy Execution**: This technique involves using legitimate, signed binaries to execute malicious code, which can help evade detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Obfuscation**: The use of **SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader** for obfuscation aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Persistence**: After evading detection, it is logical for malware to ensure persistence. Using **Scheduled Task** and **Signed Binary Proxy Execution** are both effective methods for achieving this.
   - **Dual Monitoring Services**: While the question mentions dual monitoring services, this is less specific and not as commonly associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. However, it could be part of a more complex persistence mechanism.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After obfuscating files or information to evade detection, Dexphot is likely to use techniques like **Scheduled Task** and **Signed Binary Proxy Execution** to ensure persistence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
