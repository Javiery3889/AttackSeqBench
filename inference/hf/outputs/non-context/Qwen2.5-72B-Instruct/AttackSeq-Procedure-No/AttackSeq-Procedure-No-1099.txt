### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening malicious PDF files.
     - Executing the malware with updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
     - Communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.
     - Collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Document-based Exploits and Malware Execution:**
     - CosmicDuke is known to use document-based exploits to trick victims into opening malicious files, which then execute the malware. This aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Updated Loaders from MiniDuke:**
     - CosmicDuke has been observed to use updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke, which is consistent with the second part of the sequence.
   - **Communication with Remote Servers:**
     - CosmicDuke is known to communicate with remote servers for various purposes, including exfiltration and updating. FTP and WebDav are common protocols used for such communications.
   - **Information Collection:**
     - CosmicDuke is also known to collect information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, which are typical data exfiltration techniques.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known TTPs of CosmicDuke. The malware typically uses document-based exploits to gain initial access, executes with updated loaders, communicates with remote servers for exfiltration and updating, and collects information through various means.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
