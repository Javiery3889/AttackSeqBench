### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using WMI for lateral movement.
     2. Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.
     3. Leveraging native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of internal reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **WMI for Lateral Movement:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a common technique used by threat actors to move laterally within a network. This is a valid and common TTP.
   - **Gaining Credentials via Memory Dumping LSASS and Network Sniffing:**
     - Memory dumping LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) is a technique used to extract credentials from memory. Network sniffing is another method to capture credentials in transit. Both are common techniques for credential harvesting.
   - **Leveraging Native OS Binaries and Scripts for Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - Once credentials are obtained, threat actors often use native OS binaries and scripts to gather information about user accounts and other system details. This is a logical next step in the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Lateral Movement (WMI):** The threat actor moves laterally within the network.
     2. **Credential Harvesting (LSASS Dumping and Network Sniffing):** The threat actor gains credentials.
     3. **Internal Reconnaissance (Native OS Binaries and Scripts):** The threat actor uses the obtained credentials to gather more information about the network and user accounts.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns and the behavior of threat actors like FIN13.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
