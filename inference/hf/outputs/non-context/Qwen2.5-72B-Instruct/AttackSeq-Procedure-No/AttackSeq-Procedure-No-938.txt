### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering detailed knowledge of the victims' whereabouts and travel plans.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
     3. **Initial Access:** Delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This is a common first step in many APT attacks, where the attackers gather information about their targets to plan their attack.
   - **Exploiting Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Zero-day vulnerabilities are highly valuable and are typically used sparingly due to their rarity and the risk of discovery. APT groups often reserve zero-day exploits for high-value targets or when other methods fail.
   - **Delivering Malware Disguised as Legitimate Software Updates:** This is a more common and less risky method for gaining initial access. It leverages social engineering and the trust users have in legitimate software updates.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will exploit zero-day vulnerabilities **before** delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - Given the high value and risk associated with zero-day vulnerabilities, it is more plausible that the Darkhotel APT would use the less risky method of delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates first.
   - If this method fails, they might then consider using a zero-day vulnerability, but it is not the first choice.

### Final Answer:
B: No
