### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant will communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant will indeed communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, before it collects data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug variant will not follow the described sequence of TTPs.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Initial Handshake:**
     - It is common for malware to establish an initial handshake with C&C servers to receive commands or confirm the infection. This handshake can be over HTTPS or TCP to avoid detection.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - After establishing communication with the C&C server, malware often collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This is a typical sequence to ensure that the malware has a secure and verified connection before exfiltrating data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the sequence described in the question, it is plausible that the Korplug variant would follow this sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
