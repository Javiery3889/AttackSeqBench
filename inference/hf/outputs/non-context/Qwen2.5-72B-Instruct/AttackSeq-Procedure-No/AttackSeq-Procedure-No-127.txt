### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a macro in a malicious MS Office document is used to download payloads from a C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls only after gaining initial access through the phishing email.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious MS Office document.
   - **Execution:** The macro in the document is executed, which downloads malicious payloads from the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** The question implies that the next step might involve instructing the victim to disable security controls.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that it is likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls only after gaining initial access.
     - This is plausible because once the initial access is gained, the attacker might need to disable security controls to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that it is not likely that victims would be instructed to disable security controls only after gaining initial access.
     - This is less plausible because disabling security controls is a common tactic used by attackers to ensure they can maintain access and execute further actions without being detected.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a common attack pattern:
     1. **Phishing Email:** The attacker sends a phishing email with a malicious MS Office document.
     2. **Macro Execution:** The victim opens the document, and the macro executes, downloading payloads from the C2 infrastructure.
     3. **Disabling Security Controls:** Once the attacker has initial access, they might instruct the victim to disable security controls to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical TTPs used in cyber attacks, making it more likely that the answer is "Yes."

### Final Answer: A: Yes
