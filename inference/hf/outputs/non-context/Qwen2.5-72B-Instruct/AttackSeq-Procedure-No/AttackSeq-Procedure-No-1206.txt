### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the SolarWinds supply chain was compromised, and the Sunburst backdoor was delivered to target systems.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor would use domain fronting to communicate with its C2 server.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Domain fronting is a technique used to obfuscate the destination of network traffic by using a legitimate domain to mask the actual C2 server. This technique can help evade detection by network security systems.
     - The Sunburst backdoor was designed to be stealthy and avoid detection. Using domain fronting would align with the goals of the attackers to maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicion.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the Sunburst backdoor did not use domain fronting, it would be more likely to be detected by network security systems, which could lead to the compromise being discovered more quickly.
     - However, the Sunburst backdoor did use other sophisticated techniques to remain undetected, such as mimicking legitimate SolarWinds traffic and using a long delay before initiating C2 communication.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the Sunburst backdoor did use sophisticated techniques to remain undetected, domain fronting was not one of the primary methods used. Instead, the backdoor used techniques like mimicking legitimate traffic and delaying C2 communication to avoid detection.
   - The primary method for C2 communication in the Sunburst backdoor involved using legitimate SolarWinds domains and subdomains to blend in with normal network traffic.

### Final Answer: B: No
