### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker has already created a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine if the malware is likely to configure payloads to load via `LD_PRELOAD` to evade detection during execution.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - `LD_PRELOAD` is a technique used to load a shared library before all others when a program is run. This can be used to intercept and modify the behavior of system calls, which is a common method for evading detection.
     - After ensuring persistence through a scheduled task, it is plausible that the malware would use `LD_PRELOAD` to further evade detection. This would allow the malware to run its payload without being easily detected by security tools.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware would not use `LD_PRELOAD` to evade detection.
     - While it is possible that the malware might not use `LD_PRELOAD`, it is less likely given the context of the question. The use of `LD_PRELOAD` is a common and effective technique for evasion, especially after ensuring persistence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the malware has already taken steps to ensure persistence, it is logical to assume that it would also take steps to evade detection. Using `LD_PRELOAD` is a well-known and effective method for this purpose.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware would configure payloads to load via `LD_PRELOAD` to evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
