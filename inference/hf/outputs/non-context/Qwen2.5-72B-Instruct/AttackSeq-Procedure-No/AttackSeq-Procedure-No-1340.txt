### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FireEye observed the use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files issued by DDOS C2 servers.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the attackers rebooted the target system after completing the wiping processes instead of launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers rebooted the target system after completing the wiping processes.
     - This scenario implies that the primary goal of the attackers was to wipe the system and then reboot it, rather than to launch DDoS attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attackers did not reboot the target system after completing the wiping processes.
     - This scenario implies that the primary goal of the attackers was to launch DDoS attacks against specific targets, and the wiping processes were a secondary or preparatory step.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of single-byte XOR keys to encode configuration files is a common technique in malware to obfuscate data and commands. This suggests that the attackers were using sophisticated methods to control the compromised systems.
   - The question mentions that the attackers were observed to use these techniques in a campaign, which implies a coordinated and multi-step attack.
   - The primary goal of the attackers, as described in the question, was to launch DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and to cause a 'total failure' of Next Media's network.
   - Rebooting the target system after completing the wiping processes would not align with the goal of launching DDoS attacks, as it would disrupt the ability of the compromised system to participate in the attack.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that the attackers did not reboot the target system after completing the wiping processes, as this would allow the compromised system to continue participating in the DDoS attacks.
