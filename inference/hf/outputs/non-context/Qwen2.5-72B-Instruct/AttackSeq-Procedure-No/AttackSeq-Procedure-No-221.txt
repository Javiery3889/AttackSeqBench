### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a Shellbot has established Command and Control (C&C) communication using an IRC channel.
   - The question asks whether the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host, including details such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and the presence of monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Shellbots are often designed to gather detailed information about the infected host to better understand the environment and to tailor their actions accordingly. This information can be used to:
       - Determine the capabilities of the infected host (e.g., number of processor cores, type of processor) to decide on the best course of action, such as whether to use the host for resource-intensive tasks like mining or DDoS attacks.
       - Identify the presence of security tools (e.g., Splunk, antivirus) to avoid detection or to disable them if possible.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Shellbot would not gather such information. However, this is less likely because gathering such information is a common and useful step in the post-compromise phase of an attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Shellbot would indeed gather information about the infected host.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
