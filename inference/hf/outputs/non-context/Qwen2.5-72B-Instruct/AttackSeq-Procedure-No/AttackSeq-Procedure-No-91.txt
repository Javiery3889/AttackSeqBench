### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by Vyveva's backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Compressing collected files.
     2. Sending the compressed files to the C&C server.
     3. Collecting files from newly inserted removable media.
     4. Notifying the C&C about these files.
     5. Obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - Backdoors often perform discovery tasks to gather information about the compromised system.
       - Collecting files from removable media is a common tactic to exfiltrate data.
       - Notifying the C&C server about new files and system information can help the attacker in further actions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor will not follow the described sequence.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It contradicts the typical behavior of sophisticated backdoors, which often perform discovery and data collection in a coordinated manner.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the typical behavior of advanced backdoors. These backdoors often:
     - Compress and exfiltrate collected files.
     - Collect data from removable media.
     - Perform discovery to gather system information.
     - Notify the C&C server about new files and system details.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Vyveva's backdoor will indeed follow the described sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
