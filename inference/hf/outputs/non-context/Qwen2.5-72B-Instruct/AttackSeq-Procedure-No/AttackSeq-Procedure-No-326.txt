### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the XAgent app on iOS 7 devices.
   - The sequence includes:
     - The app hides its icon and runs in the background.
     - The app uses `net.exe group "domain admins" /domain` to identify Domain Administrators.
     - The app sends gathered information, including processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **XAgent on iOS 7:**
     - XAgent is a known piece of malware that has been used in various cyber espionage campaigns.
     - On iOS 7, the app is designed to run stealthily by hiding its icon and operating in the background.
   - **Use of `net.exe`:**
     - `net.exe` is a command-line utility typically used in Windows environments to manage network resources.
     - It is not a tool that would be available or relevant on an iOS device.
   - **Discovery and C2 Communication:**
     - The app is described as gathering information and sending it to a C2 server, which is a common behavior for malware.
     - However, the use of `net.exe` to identify Domain Administrators is specific to Windows and does not align with the iOS environment.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1: Environment Mismatch:**
     - The use of `net.exe` is specific to Windows and is not applicable to iOS.
   - **Step 2: Plausibility of Actions:**
     - The actions of hiding the icon and running in the background are plausible for an iOS app.
     - Sending gathered information to a C2 server is also a common behavior for malware.
   - **Step 3: Inconsistency in the Sequence:**
     - The inclusion of `net.exe` in the sequence breaks the plausibility because it is not a tool that would be used on an iOS device.
