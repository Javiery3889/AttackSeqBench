### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox.
     - Employing cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the attackers will compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase only afterward.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves gathering data and information from the target system. This typically happens before the data is exfiltrated.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The Exfiltration phase involves transferring the collected data out of the target network. This is typically the final phase in the attack sequence.
   - **Compression:**
     - Compressing data (e.g., using WinRAR) is often done to reduce the size of the data being exfiltrated, making it easier to transfer and less likely to be detected.
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The question states that the exfiltration has already occurred using custom malware and cURL for Windows.
     - If the data has already been exfiltrated, it would not make sense to compress the data afterward, as the exfiltration has already been completed.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that the exfiltration has already taken place, it is not likely that the attackers would compress the data in the Collection phase afterward.

**Final Answer: B: No**
