### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Rocket Kitten, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence involves the use of a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under the **Credential Access** tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Usage:** A keylogger is a tool that records keystrokes, which can be used to capture sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This is a common technique under the **Credential Access** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **GUI Input Capture:** This technique involves prompting the user to enter their credentials through a graphical user interface (GUI), such as a fake login page or a pop-up window. This is also a technique under the **Credential Access** tactic, but it is different from using a keylogger.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Keylogger vs. GUI Input Capture:**
     - A keylogger passively captures keystrokes without the user's knowledge.
     - GUI input capture actively prompts the user to enter their credentials, which is a more interactive and potentially more noticeable method.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - If Rocket Kitten has already successfully employed a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts, it is less likely that they would then prompt the user for their credentials through a GUI input capture. This is because the keylogger has already provided the necessary credentials, and prompting the user again would be redundant and could increase the risk of detection.
   - **Operational Security:**
     - Threat actors generally prefer methods that are less likely to be detected. Using a keylogger is a stealthier approach compared to actively prompting the user, which could raise suspicion and alert the user to the presence of malware.

### Final Answer:
B: No
