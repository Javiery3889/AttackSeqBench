### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Gamaredon group gains initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access is achieved through malicious document files sent via emails. This is a common tactic used by various threat actors, including Gamaredon, to gain a foothold in a target's system.
   - **Use of `at` Command:** The `at` command is a native Windows task scheduler tool that can be used to schedule tasks. It is a less sophisticated method compared to other scheduling tools like `schtasks` or PowerShell, but it is still used in some scenarios.
   - **Persistence via RUN Key:** Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry is a common method to achieve persistence. It ensures that the malware or malicious script runs every time the system starts.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Initial Access:** The group gains initial access through a malicious document.
     2. **Task Scheduling:** After gaining access, the group might use the `at` command to schedule a task. This could be to execute a payload at a specific time or to maintain a low profile.
     3. **Persistence:** Once the task is scheduled and executed, the group might then register a RUN key to ensure persistence.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The use of the `at` command to schedule a task is a plausible step in the attack sequence. It can be used to delay the execution of the payload, which can help in evading detection.
     - Registering a RUN key for persistence is a logical next step after ensuring that the payload is executed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of actions and the plausibility of each step, it is likely that the group will use the `at` command to schedule a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
