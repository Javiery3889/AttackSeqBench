### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where:
     - A PDF attachment is sent.
     - The PDF passes through security filters and appears benign.
     - The attack then abuses the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and elevate privileges.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - Let's break down the sequence:
       - **Sending a PDF attachment:** This is a common initial attack vector used in phishing campaigns to deliver malware.
       - **Passing through security filters and appearing benign:** This indicates that the PDF was crafted to evade detection by security systems, which is a common technique used by sophisticated attackers.
       - **Abusing the Windows AutoElevate backdoor to bypass UAC:** This is a specific technique used to gain higher privileges on a Windows system. The AutoElevate feature can be abused to bypass UAC, which is a known TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Bypass User Account Control" tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack techniques. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
