### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where malware collects keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the malware will only gather information about the infected computer (system and user names) after collecting the initial data and before transmitting the data through encrypted emails.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Data Collection:**
     - Keystrokes: This is typically done to capture sensitive information like passwords and other user inputs.
     - Directory listings: This helps the attacker understand the file structure and identify valuable files.
     - HWP documents: These are specific to Korean word processing software and are likely targeted for their content.
   - **System and User Information:**
     - Gathering system and user names is a common early step in many attacks to understand the environment and potentially escalate privileges.
   - **Data Transmission:**
     - Transmitting data through encrypted emails is a method to exfiltrate the collected information securely.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Typical Attack Sequence:**
     - In a typical attack, an attacker would first gather basic system and user information to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - After gaining this initial information, the attacker would then proceed to collect more specific data like keystrokes, directory listings, and specific file types (e.g., HWP documents).
     - Finally, the collected data would be exfiltrated, often through encrypted channels to avoid detection.
   - **Given Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (collecting keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents first, then gathering system and user names) is less common and less logical.
     - It would be more efficient and typical for the malware to gather system and user information first to understand the environment before collecting more specific data.

### Final Answer:
B: No
