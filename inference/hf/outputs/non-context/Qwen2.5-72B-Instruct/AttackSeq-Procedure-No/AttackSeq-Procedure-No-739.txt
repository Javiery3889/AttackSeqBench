### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Elderwood Project attackers.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. Establishing command and control (C&C) servers.
     2. Maintaining control over compromised systems.
     3. Retrieving commands from the attackers.
   - The question then asks if the attackers will deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C&C Servers:**
     - This is typically a post-compromise activity. Once the attackers have gained initial access to a system, they set up C&C servers to maintain control and communicate with the compromised systems.
   - **Maintaining Control and Retrieving Commands:**
     - These activities are also post-compromise and involve the attackers using the C&C infrastructure to send commands and receive data from the compromised systems.
   - **Deploying Zero-Day Exploits for Initial Access:**
     - Zero-day exploits are used to gain initial access to a system. They are typically used in the early stages of an attack to exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known to the public or patched.
   - **Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - Watering hole attacks involve compromising a website that the target frequently visits to deliver malware or exploits. This is a common method for gaining initial access.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question (establishing C&C, maintaining control, retrieving commands) suggests that the attackers have already gained initial access and are in the post-compromise phase.
   - Deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks would logically occur before the establishment of C&C servers and the maintenance of control.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the question describes post-compromise activities, it is unlikely that the attackers would deploy zero-day exploits to gain initial access at this stage. The zero-day exploits would have been used earlier in the attack lifecycle to gain the initial access that led to the establishment of C&C servers.

### Final Answer: B: No
