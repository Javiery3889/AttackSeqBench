### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor MuddyWater.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access.
     - Utilizing command and control (C2) servers in Pakistan and China to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that MuddyWater will only use C2 servers in Pakistan and China after gaining initial access.
     - While it is possible that MuddyWater might use C2 servers in specific regions, it is not necessarily the only or most likely scenario.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that MuddyWater might use C2 servers in other locations as well, or that the use of C2 servers is not strictly limited to the post-initial access phase.
     - MuddyWater, like many advanced threat actors, often uses a variety of C2 infrastructure to maintain operational flexibility and resilience. This can include servers in multiple countries to avoid detection and to ensure redundancy.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - MuddyWater is known for its sophisticated and adaptable TTPs. They often use a diverse set of C2 servers to maintain their operations and avoid detection.
   - Limiting their C2 infrastructure to only Pakistan and China would be a less flexible and more predictable approach, which is not typical of advanced threat actors.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that MuddyWater would use a broader range of C2 servers, not just those in Pakistan and China.

### Final Answer: B: No
