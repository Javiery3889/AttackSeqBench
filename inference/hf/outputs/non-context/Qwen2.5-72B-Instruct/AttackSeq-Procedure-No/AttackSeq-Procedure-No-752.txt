### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     - Collecting the MAC address of the infected host.
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence (Downloading to Startup Folder):**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1547 (Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution).
   - **Discovery (Collecting MAC Address):**
     - Collecting the MAC address is a form of discovery. It helps the attacker identify the infected host and potentially other networked devices. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1082 (Discovery: System Information Discovery).
   - **Command and Control (Communicating with Control Servers):**
     - Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a common method for command and control (C2) communication. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071 (Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a typical attack pattern:
     1. **Persistence:** The malware ensures it can run again after a system reboot.
     2. **Discovery:** The malware collects information about the infected host, such as the MAC address, to understand the environment.
     3. **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with the control server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the alignment with common TTPs, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
