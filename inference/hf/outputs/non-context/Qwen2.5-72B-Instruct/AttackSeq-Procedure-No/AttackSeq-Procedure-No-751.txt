### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     2. Ensuring persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     3. Fetching computer name and user name information as part of discovery activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information only after ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Rising Sun implant will not necessarily fetch computer name and user name information only after ensuring persistence.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Persistence Before Discovery:**
     - Ensuring persistence is a critical step in maintaining long-term access to the compromised system. It is common for malware to establish persistence before performing other activities to ensure that it can survive reboots and other disruptions.
   - **Discovery After Persistence:**
     - Once persistence is established, the malware can then focus on gathering information about the compromised system, such as the computer name and user name. This information is valuable for further stages of the attack, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (communicate with control servers, ensure persistence, then perform discovery) is a logical and common sequence in malware operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
