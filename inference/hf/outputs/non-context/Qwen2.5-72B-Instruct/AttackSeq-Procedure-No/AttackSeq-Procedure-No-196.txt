### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the RevengeHotels campaign has compromised hotel systems and online travel agencies to capture credentials.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware used in this campaign will utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Capturing mouse movements can be useful in certain scenarios, such as keylogging or screen recording, to gather additional context or to capture user interactions. However, the primary goal of the described attack is to capture credentials, which can often be achieved through more direct methods like keylogging, credential dumping, or network sniffing.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - Given that the primary objective is to capture credentials, the use of tools to capture mouse movements seems less likely. Capturing mouse movements is not a common or necessary step in credential theft, especially when more efficient methods are available.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The primary goal of the RevengeHotels campaign is to capture credentials from compromised systems. Tools to capture mouse movements are not typically necessary for this task and are more often used in scenarios where additional user interaction data is required.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the malware used in this campaign would utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

### Final Answer: B: No
