### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an adversary (SUNSPOT) is monitoring running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe` as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them, as part of the Impact tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:**
     - Monitoring running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe` is a common technique used to understand the environment and identify potential targets or tools that can be exploited. This is part of the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Impact Tactic:**
     - Double-extortion ransomware involves two main steps:
       1. **Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from the victim's systems.
       2. **Encryption:** Encrypting the victim's files to demand a ransom.
     - This is a common technique used in the Impact tactic to maximize the pressure on the victim to pay the ransom.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Monitoring `MsBuild.exe`:**
     - `MsBuild.exe` is a build tool used in .NET development. Monitoring it could indicate that the adversary is looking for development environments or build processes that could be exploited.
   - **Double-Extortion Ransomware:**
     - Double-extortion ransomware is a sophisticated and high-impact attack. It is often used by advanced threat actors who have already gained a significant foothold in the network and have the capability to exfiltrate data and encrypt files.
   - **Connection Between Discovery and Impact:**
     - The monitoring of `MsBuild.exe` as part of the Discovery tactic does not directly indicate that the adversary will engage in double-extortion ransomware. However, it is a plausible next step if the adversary has already gained the necessary access and is looking to maximize the impact of their attack.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While the monitoring of `MsBuild.exe` is a part of the Discovery tactic, it does not necessarily mean that the adversary will engage in double-extortion ransomware. However, given the sophistication of such attacks and the potential for an advanced adversary to escalate their activities, it is a plausible scenario.

### Final Answer:
B: No

However, it is important to note that while the monitoring of `MsBuild.exe` does not directly indicate double-extortion ransomware, it is a plausible next step for an advanced adversary. Therefore, organizations should remain vigilant and monitor for signs of such activities.
