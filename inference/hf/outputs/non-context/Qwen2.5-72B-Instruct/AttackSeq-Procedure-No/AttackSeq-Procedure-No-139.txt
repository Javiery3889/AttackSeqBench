### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
     2. Exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold.
     3. Attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems:**
     - This is typically a post-compromise activity. Once an attacker has gained initial access, they will often secure persistence to maintain long-term access to the victim's network.
   - **Exploiting an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold:**
     - This is an initial access technique. Attackers often use vulnerabilities in software to gain an initial foothold in a network.
   - **Attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase:**
     - This is a pre-compromise activity. Reconnaissance is the first stage of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target, including user credentials.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Post-compromise (securing persistence).
     2. Initial access (exploiting a vulnerability).
     3. Pre-compromise (reconnaissance and credential gathering).
   - This sequence is logically inconsistent. Typically, an attacker would:
     1. Conduct reconnaissance and gather credentials.
     2. Use the gathered credentials or a vulnerability to gain initial access.
     3. Secure persistence once they have gained access.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is not plausible because it does not follow the logical order of a typical attack sequence.
