### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a malicious macro in an MS Office document, the download of the RMS tool and supporting scripts, and the potential actions of the threat actors.
   - The specific actions in question are:
     - Execution of a malicious macro.
     - Downloading the RMS tool and supporting scripts.
     - Killing the 'rundll32.exe' process.
     - Achieving persistence by adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry.
     - Launching the RMS executable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Killing 'rundll32.exe':**
     - `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows system file used to load and execute DLL files. It is often used by legitimate applications and system processes.
     - Threat actors might kill `rundll32.exe` if it is running a process that could interfere with their activities, such as a security tool or a process that could log their actions.
     - However, killing `rundll32.exe` can be highly suspicious and may trigger alerts or system instability, which could draw attention to the attack.

   - **Achieving Persistence:**
     - Adding a 'Microtik' string value to the registry and launching the RMS executable are common techniques for achieving persistence.
     - Persistence is a critical step in maintaining long-term access to a compromised system.

3. **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the threat actors have already executed a malicious macro and downloaded the necessary tools.
     - The next logical steps would be to achieve persistence and ensure that the malicious payload is executed on system startup.
     - Killing `rundll32.exe` is not a typical or necessary step in achieving persistence, and it could complicate the attack by drawing attention to the malicious activities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs and the potential risks associated with killing `rundll32.exe`, it is less likely that the threat actors would attempt to kill this process before achieving persistence.

### Final Answer: B: No
