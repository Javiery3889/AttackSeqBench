### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the 'IPsec Helper' awaiting commands from C2 (Command and Control) servers to send reconnaissance information or download files.
   - It then asks if Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions as part of data destruction activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **IPsec Helper Awaiting Commands:**
     - This indicates that the malware is in a state of waiting for instructions from a C2 server. This is a common tactic in the initial stages of an attack, often used for reconnaissance and file downloads.
   - **Deployment of CaddyWiper:**
     - CaddyWiper is a known data wiper malware that has been used in targeted attacks, particularly against critical infrastructure and OT systems. It is designed to destroy data on infected systems, including files on mapped drives and physical drive partitions.
   - **Agrius and CaddyWiper:**
     - Agrius is a threat actor known for its use of destructive malware, including CaddyWiper, to cause significant damage to victim systems. The deployment of CaddyWiper aligns with the data destruction activities typically associated with Agrius.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, where the 'IPsec Helper' is awaiting commands and the known capabilities of Agrius to deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction, it is highly plausible that Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
