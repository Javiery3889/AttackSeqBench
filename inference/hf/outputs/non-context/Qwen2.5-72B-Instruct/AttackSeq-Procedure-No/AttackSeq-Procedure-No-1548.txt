### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware Smoaler.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Executing an embedded payload.
     2. Writing the payload to the %TEMP% folder.
     3. Running the payload.
     4. Using a WMI event subscription for persistence.
     5. Overwriting the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Executing an embedded payload and writing it to the %TEMP% folder:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to execute and persist on a system.
   - **Step 2: Running the payload:**
     - Once the payload is written to the %TEMP% folder, it is typically executed to carry out its malicious activities.
   - **Step 3: Using a WMI event subscription for persistence:**
     - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) event subscriptions are a method used by malware to ensure that it runs automatically at specific times or in response to certain system events. This is a common persistence technique.
   - **Step 4: Overwriting the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file:**
     - Overwriting the infected file with a decoy file is a technique used to evade detection by making it appear as if the original file was never infected. This can help the malware avoid being detected by security software or manual inspection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent and aligns with known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The use of WMI event subscriptions for persistence is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as it helps the malware maintain a foothold on the system.
   - Overwriting the infected file with a decoy file is also a plausible step to evade detection.

### Final Answer:
