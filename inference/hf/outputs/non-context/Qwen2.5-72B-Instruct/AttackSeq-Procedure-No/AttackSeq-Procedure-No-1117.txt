### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Attempting lateral movement using the `net use` command.
     - Confirming communication with the target device via a ping command.
     - Using compromised legitimate websites as C2 (Command and Control) servers for communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement with `net use` Command:**
     - The `net use` command is commonly used to map network drives and establish connections to network resources. This is a typical technique for lateral movement in a network.
   - **Confirming Communication with Ping Command:**
     - After establishing a connection, an attacker might use the `ping` command to verify that the connection is active and the target device is reachable. This is a logical next step to ensure the network path is clear.
   - **Using Compromised Legitimate Websites as C2 Servers:**
     - Using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers is a technique to avoid detection by blending in with normal traffic. This is typically done to maintain persistent communication with the compromised target.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attacker would first attempt lateral movement, then confirm the communication, and finally set up C2 communication.
   - However, the question specifically asks if the attacker is likely to confirm communication with the target device via a ping command **only after** using compromised legitimate websites as C2 servers.
   - This implies a specific order: lateral movement, C2 setup, and then ping. This order is less logical because:
     - The attacker would typically want to confirm the network connection (using `ping`) before setting up C2 communication to ensure the target is reachable.
     - Setting up C2 communication is a more advanced step that usually follows initial network verification.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs, it is more plausible that the attacker would confirm communication with the target device via a ping command before setting up C2 communication.

### Final Answer: B: No
