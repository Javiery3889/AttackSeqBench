### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that CosmicDuke might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Searching removable drives.
     - Skipping certain file types during collection.
     - Compressing output data using a custom LZW algorithm.
     - Exfiltrating the data via FTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Searching Removable Drives:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to find and collect sensitive data from removable storage devices.
   - **Skipping Certain File Types:**
     - Malware often skips certain file types to avoid detection or to focus on more valuable data.
   - **Compressing Output Data:**
     - Compressing data before exfiltration is a common practice to reduce the size of the data being transferred, making it less noticeable and more efficient to send.
   - **Custom LZW Algorithm:**
     - Using a custom implementation of a compression algorithm like LZW is less common but not unheard of. It can be used to evade detection by standard security tools that might recognize common compression formats.
   - **Exfiltrating via FTP:**
     - FTP is a common protocol for data exfiltration, especially in older or less sophisticated malware. However, it is also a protocol that can be easily detected and blocked by network security measures.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Plausibility of the Sequence:**
     - The sequence of TTPs described is plausible. Searching removable drives, skipping certain file types, and compressing data are all common techniques used by malware.
     - Using a custom LZW algorithm for compression is less common but not impossible, especially for more advanced malware like CosmicDuke.
     - Exfiltrating data via FTP is a known method, although it is less stealthy compared to more modern exfiltration techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility of the described sequence and the known capabilities of CosmicDuke, the most likely answer is that CosmicDuke would follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
