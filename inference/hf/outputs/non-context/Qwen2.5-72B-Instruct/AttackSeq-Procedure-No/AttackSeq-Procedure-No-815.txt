### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for a malware called WinDealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with C2 (Command and Control) servers.
     - Using an AES key encrypted with RSA for command and control activities.
     - Processing and encrypting stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will indeed process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that WinDealer will not process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - It is common for malware to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - Using an AES key encrypted with RSA for secure communication is a plausible and common technique to protect the data in transit.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - During the exfiltration phase, malware often processes and encrypts stolen data to avoid detection and ensure the data remains confidential.
     - Storing encrypted data in the %TEMP% directory is a common tactic because the %TEMP% directory is often used for temporary files and is less likely to be monitored closely.
     - Using a specific file extension (e.g., ".a") for the encrypted files is also a plausible technique to make the files less suspicious or to identify them for exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practices in malware behavior, it is plausible that WinDealer will process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory during the exfiltration phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
