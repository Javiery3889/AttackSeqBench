### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Responder tool to achieve credential access.
   - The question then asks if the group is likely to conduct discovery activities (such as system service discovery) only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Responder Tool for Credential Access:**
     - The Responder tool is commonly used to capture network credentials, such as NTLM hashes, by responding to LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) requests. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to gain access to credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After obtaining credentials, the next logical step is to use these credentials to move laterally within the network. This can be done using various techniques, including Windows commands and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Discovery activities, such as system service discovery, are typically conducted to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation. These activities can be performed before or after lateral movement, depending on the attacker's strategy.
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The question suggests a specific sequence: credential access → lateral movement → discovery activities.
     - However, in many attack scenarios, discovery activities can be performed at various stages, including before lateral movement, to gather information that can aid in the lateral movement process.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that discovery activities can be performed at different stages of an attack, it is not strictly necessary for the Lazarus group to conduct discovery activities only after lateral movement. Discovery can be done before lateral movement to gather information that can facilitate the movement.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the Lazarus group is not likely to conduct discovery activities only after using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
