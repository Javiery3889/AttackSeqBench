### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware "BlueBravo."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using HTTPS for C2 (Command and Control) communication.
     - Using Microsoft OneDrive and potentially DropBox for bidirectional communication.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware gathers victim system information (username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes) only after these communication methods are established.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **C2 Communication (HTTPS):** Establishing C2 communication is a critical step for malware to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This is often one of the first steps after initial infection.
     - **File Sharing Services (OneDrive, DropBox):** Using file sharing services for bidirectional communication can be a method to exfiltrate data or receive additional commands. This is also typically done early in the attack to ensure a reliable communication channel.
     - **Gathering Victim System Information:** Collecting system information is a common early-stage activity for malware. This information is often used to determine the value of the target, tailor further actions, and exfiltrate data.

   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - It is highly likely that the malware would gather system information as soon as possible after gaining initial access to the system. This is because the information is crucial for the malware to understand its environment and plan subsequent actions.
     - Establishing C2 and file sharing communication channels is also a high-priority task, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite for gathering system information. In many cases, these tasks can occur concurrently or in a different order.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical behavior of malware, it is not likely that the malware would wait to gather system information only after establishing C2 and file sharing communication. The gathering of system information is often an early and immediate action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
