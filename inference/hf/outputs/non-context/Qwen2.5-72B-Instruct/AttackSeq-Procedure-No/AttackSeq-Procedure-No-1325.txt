### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Sayad malware.
   - The sequence mentioned is: exfiltration of collected and encrypted data, followed by capturing screenshots, and then performing discovery by collecting system and application details.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Collected and Encrypted Data:**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the malware sends the data it has already collected and encrypted to a malicious web server.
   - **Capturing Screenshots:**
     - This is a data collection technique where the malware captures images of the user's screen.
   - **Discovery by Collecting System and Application Details:**
     - This is a reconnaissance technique where the malware gathers information about the system and applications running on the compromised host.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - Typically, in a logical attack sequence, malware would first perform discovery to understand the environment it is in before deciding what data to collect and how to exfiltrate it.
   - However, the question states that the malware exfiltrates data first, which suggests that it has already collected and encrypted the data.
   - After exfiltration, the malware might then proceed to capture additional data, such as screenshots, and perform further discovery to gather more information.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question (exfiltration, then capturing screenshots, then discovery) is not the most logical or common sequence.
   - It is more plausible that the malware would perform discovery first to understand the environment, then collect and exfiltrate data, and possibly capture additional data like screenshots.

### Final Answer:
B: No
