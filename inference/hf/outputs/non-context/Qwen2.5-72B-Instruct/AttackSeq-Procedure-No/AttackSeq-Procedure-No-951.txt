### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Lazarus Group gains initial access through malicious documents containing job offers sent via various communication platforms (LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email).
   - After gaining access, the question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will:
     - Execute malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor.
     - Leverage the SQLite DLL library in the victim's environment.
     - Use system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information during reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of malicious documents containing job offers sent via multiple communication platforms is a common tactic used by advanced threat actors, including the Lazarus Group. This aligns with known TTPs of the Lazarus Group, which often uses social engineering and spear-phishing to gain initial access.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - The CommsCacher backdoor is a known tool used by the Lazarus Group. It is designed to establish a backdoor on the victim's system, allowing the attackers to maintain persistence and execute further commands.
   - **Leveraging SQLite DLL:**
     - The use of the SQLite DLL library is less common in the context of initial reconnaissance. However, it could be used for data exfiltration or to manipulate local databases, which might be part of a more advanced phase of the attack.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Using system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information is a standard reconnaissance technique. These tools are commonly used to map the network and gather information about the victim's environment.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access method (malicious documents via multiple communication platforms) is consistent with the Lazarus Group's known TTPs.
   - The execution of malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor is a plausible next step, as it is a known tool used by the group.
   - The use of SQLite DLL, while less common in initial reconnaissance, could be part of a more advanced phase of the attack, but it is not typically the first step after gaining access.
   - The use of system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` for reconnaissance is a standard and expected step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs described in the question is likely to occur. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
