### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The first phase mentioned is the **Resource Development** phase, where adversaries identify and use domains resolving to the same IP address.
   - The second phase mentioned is the **Reconnaissance** phase, where adversaries use functions like **DOCKERGEDDON** to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - In this phase, adversaries typically gather and prepare the resources they need for an attack, such as domains, IP addresses, and infrastructure.
     - Identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address is a common technique to create a network of resources that can be used for various purposes, including hosting malicious content or serving as command and control (C2) servers.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - In this phase, adversaries gather information about the target to plan and execute their attack.
     - Using tools like **DOCKERGEDDON** to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs is a specific reconnaissance technique. **DOCKERGEDDON** is a tool designed to exploit misconfigured Docker APIs, which can provide adversaries with valuable information about the target's infrastructure.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical:
     - **Resource Development** is typically the first phase where adversaries set up their infrastructure.
     - **Reconnaissance** follows, where adversaries use the resources they have developed to gather information about the target.
   - Using **DOCKERGEDDON** during the **Reconnaissance** phase to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs is a plausible and effective technique for gathering information about the target's infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
B: No

**Reasoning:**
- While the sequence of TTPs described is logical and plausible, the use of **DOCKERGEDDON** is more specific to the **Exploitation** phase rather than the **Reconnaissance** phase. **Reconnaissance** typically involves gathering information, while **Exploitation** involves using that information to gain access to the target. Therefore, it is less likely that adversaries would use **DOCKERGEDDON** during the **Reconnaissance** phase.
