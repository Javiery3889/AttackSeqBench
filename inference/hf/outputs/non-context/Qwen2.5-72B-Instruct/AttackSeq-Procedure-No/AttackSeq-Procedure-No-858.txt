### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Explosive Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:** Using keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Employing a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Keylogging is a common technique used to capture credentials, such as administrator passwords. This is a plausible first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Abusing a compromised AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) server's SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) token is a sophisticated method for lateral movement. SAML tokens are used for single sign-on (SSO) and can provide access to multiple resources within a network.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Using a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 is a common technique to maintain persistent control over compromised systems. This can involve multiple layers of servers to obfuscate the attacker's true location and to provide redundancy.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent:
     - **Step 1:** The attacker gains initial access and captures administrator credentials using keylogging.
     - **Step 2:** The attacker uses the captured credentials to compromise an AD FS server and abuse SAML tokens for lateral movement.
     - **Step 3:** The attacker establishes a multi-tiered C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the plausibility of each step, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
