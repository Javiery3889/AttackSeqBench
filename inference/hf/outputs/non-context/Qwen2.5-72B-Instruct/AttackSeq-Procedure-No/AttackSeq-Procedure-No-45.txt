### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group known as Machete.
   - The sequence in question is: 
     1. Creating Windows Task Scheduler tasks for maintaining persistence.
     2. Executing a downloader that opens a decoy PDF or Microsoft Office document.
     3. Installing backdoor components.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Creating Windows Task Scheduler tasks for maintaining persistence:**
     - This is a common technique used by many threat actors to ensure that their malware or backdoors are executed regularly or at specific intervals. It is a well-documented persistence mechanism.
   - **Executing a downloader that opens a decoy PDF or Microsoft Office document:**
     - This is a common initial infection vector. Threat actors often use social engineering to trick users into opening malicious documents, which then download additional malware.
   - **Installing backdoor components:**
     - Once the initial infection vector is successful, the next step is often to install backdoor components to maintain access to the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Persistence (Task Scheduler):** Ensuring the malware persists across reboots or system restarts.
     2. **Initial Infection (Downloader):** Using a decoy document to trick the user into executing the malware.
     3. **Backdoor Installation:** Installing components to maintain long-term access to the system.

4. **Consider Machete's Known TTPs:**
   - Machete is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and gain long-term access to target systems. They have been observed using various methods, including task schedulers and decoy documents, to achieve their goals.

### Final Answer:
Given the logical sequence and the known TTPs of Machete, it is likely that they would create Windows Task Scheduler tasks for maintaining persistence prior to executing a downloader that opens a decoy PDF or Microsoft Office document and installs backdoor components.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
