### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor, Agrius, exploits a public-facing application vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379) to gain initial access.
   - It then asks whether Agrius is likely to use "pass the ticket" for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2018-13379:**
     - CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS that allows an attacker to retrieve the contents of files, including sensitive information like credentials.
     - This is a common initial access vector for many threat actors.

   - **Pass the Ticket (PtT) for Lateral Movement:**
     - Pass the Ticket is a technique where an attacker uses a Kerberos ticket to authenticate to other systems within the network.
     - This technique is typically used after gaining access to a network and obtaining valid credentials or tickets.

   - **Communication with C2 Servers using 'IPsec Helper' Backdoor over HTTP:**
     - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a specific tool used by Agrius to communicate with C2 servers.
     - It is often used after establishing a foothold in the network and setting up communication channels.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Initial Access:** Agrius exploits CVE-2018-13379 to gain initial access to the network.
     - **Lateral Movement:** After gaining initial access, Agrius would likely need to move laterally within the network to reach more valuable targets.
     - **Pass the Ticket:** Using Pass the Ticket is a common technique for lateral movement, especially if the attacker has obtained valid Kerberos tickets.
     - **C2 Communication:** Once the attacker has established a presence in the network and moved laterally, they would set up communication with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (initial access, lateral movement using Pass the Ticket, and then C2 communication) is a logical and common sequence in cyber attacks.
     - Therefore, it is plausible that Agrius would use Pass the Ticket for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers.
