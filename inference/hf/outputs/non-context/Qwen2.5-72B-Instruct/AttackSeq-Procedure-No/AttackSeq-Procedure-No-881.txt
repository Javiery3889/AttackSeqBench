### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Aria-body backdoor.
   - The backdoor is engaged in creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities, which are part of the Collection phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase only afterward.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The Collection phase involves gathering data from the target system, such as creating/deleting files and taking screenshots.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment better. This includes detailed system information, hostname, and public IP.
   - **Sequence of Phases:**
     - Typically, the Discovery phase precedes the Collection phase. Attackers often gather information about the system and network before deciding what data to collect and how to collect it.
     - It is less common for an attacker to perform data collection activities (like creating/deleting files and taking screenshots) before gathering detailed system information, hostname, and public IP.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it is more likely that the Aria-body backdoor would gather detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase before engaging in data collection activities.
   - Therefore, the answer is that it is not likely to gather this information only afterward.

**Final Answer: B: No**
