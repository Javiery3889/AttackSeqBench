### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a backdoor installed by attackers performs the following actions:
     - Shuts down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP Analysis:**
     - **Shutting Down the Victim's Computer:**
       - This action is typically associated with the **Impact** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically the **System Shutdown** technique (T1489). The goal is to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
     - **Exfiltration Over C&C Channel:**
       - Exfiltration is a separate phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, typically occurring after the attacker has gained access to the system and has collected data. The techniques involved in exfiltration include **Data Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel** (T1010) and **Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium** (T1011).
     - **Encrypted Communication:**
       - Encrypted communication is a common method used by attackers to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of their C&C communications. This is often part of the **Command and Control** phase (T1071, T1105, etc.).

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question involves a backdoor that first shuts down the victim's computer. This action is designed to disrupt operations and impact system availability.
     - Once the computer is shut down, it is unlikely that the backdoor will be able to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel because the system is no longer operational.
     - Exfiltration typically requires the system to be running and connected to the network, which is not the case if the system is shut down.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of events, it is not likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication after shutting down the victim's computer.

### Final Answer: B: No
