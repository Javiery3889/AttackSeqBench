### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access via spear-phishing emails containing trojanized installation executables.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities (such as gathering system information and network views) before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to gain a foothold in the victim's system.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to understand the environment it has compromised. This includes gathering system information (e.g., OS version, installed software) and network views (e.g., IP addresses, network topology).
   - **Process Hollowing:**
     - Process hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection. This is often done after the malware has gathered enough information about the system to determine the best process to target.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access through spear-phishing.
     2. **Discovery:** The malware gathers system and network information to understand the environment.
     3. **Execution with Evasion:** The malware uses process hollowing to execute its payload while evading detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence of events and the common practices in malware behavior, it is highly likely that TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities before performing execution using process hollowing.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
