### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using the Responder tool to harvest credentials during the credential access phase.
     - Collecting password policy information.
     - Achieving lateral movement using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) and compromised routers to bypass network segmentation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Responder Tool:**
     - Responder is a tool used to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to capture NTLMv2 hashes and other credentials. It is commonly used during the credential access phase to gather credentials.
   - **Collecting Password Policy Information:**
     - Collecting password policy information is a reconnaissance activity that helps attackers understand the target environment's security measures. This information can be useful for crafting more effective attacks, but it is not strictly necessary for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement using WMIC and Compromised Routers:**
     - Lateral movement is a technique used to move from one system to another within a network. WMIC is a powerful tool for this purpose, and compromised routers can be used to bypass network segmentation and gain access to other parts of the network.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Use Responder to harvest credentials.
     2. Collect password policy information.
     3. Achieve lateral movement using WMIC and compromised routers.
   - While collecting password policy information can be useful, it is not a necessary step before achieving lateral movement. The primary goal after harvesting credentials is to use them to move laterally within the network.
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group will likely collect password policy information **before** achieving lateral movement. Given the typical attack flow, it is more likely that the group would focus on using the harvested credentials to achieve lateral movement as quickly as possible.

### Final Answer:
B: No
