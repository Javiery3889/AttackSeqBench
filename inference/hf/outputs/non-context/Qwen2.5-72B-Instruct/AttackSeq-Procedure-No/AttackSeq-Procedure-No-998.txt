### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
     - Longhorn's tools abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
     - Performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with espionage-focused malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Zero-Day Exploit in Word Document:**
     - This is a common initial access technique (T1203: Exploit Public-Facing Application) where a zero-day exploit is used to compromise a target system via a malicious document.
   - **Infection with Plexor Malware:**
     - Plexor is a known malware that can be delivered through such exploits. It is often used for initial infection and can provide a foothold in the target network.
   - **Abuse of OAuth Access Tokens:**
     - OAuth access tokens are often used to gain unauthorized access to web applications and services, including email accounts. This is a technique used for credential access (T1136: Create Account) and persistence (T1110: Brute Force).
   - **System Fingerprinting and Discovery:**
     - Once the initial infection is successful, attackers typically perform system fingerprinting and discovery to understand the environment and identify valuable targets. This is part of the reconnaissance phase (T1082: System Information Discovery) and is crucial for further lateral movement and data exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent:
     - The initial infection via a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
     - The use of Plexor malware to establish a foothold.
     - The abuse of OAuth access tokens to gain access to email accounts.
     - Performing system fingerprinting and discovery to gather more information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common use of these TTPs in cyber attacks, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
