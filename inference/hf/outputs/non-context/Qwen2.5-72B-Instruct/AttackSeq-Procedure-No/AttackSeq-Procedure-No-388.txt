### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors first execute malicious code using the AtomBombing technique.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use a resource fork to change the icon of the executable to a macOS JPEG or text file icon.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that it is likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to change the icon of the executable.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that it is not likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to change the icon of the executable.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **AtomBombing Technique:**
     - AtomBombing is a code injection technique that exploits the Windows atom tables to execute arbitrary code. It is primarily used to inject code into a process without using common injection methods like `CreateRemoteThread` or `WriteProcessMemory`.
   - **Resource Forks:**
     - Resource forks are a feature of the macOS file system that allows additional data to be stored alongside a file. They are often used to store metadata, such as icons, for files.
   - **Context of the Question:**
     - The question is asking about the likelihood of threat actors using a resource fork to change the icon of an executable after using the AtomBombing technique.
     - The AtomBombing technique is specific to Windows, while resource forks are specific to macOS.
     - It is unlikely that threat actors would use a macOS-specific technique (resource forks) to change the icon of an executable on a Windows system, where the AtomBombing technique is being used.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the AtomBombing technique is used on Windows and resource forks are a macOS feature, it is not likely that threat actors would use a resource fork to change the icon of an executable in this context.

### Final Answer: B: No
