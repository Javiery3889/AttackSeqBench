### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian hackers sent "consent phishing" emails containing malicious links designed to steal usersâ€™ access tokens before attempting to gain initial access via social media platforms and spear-phishing messages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Sending "consent phishing" emails to steal access tokens.
     2. Using social media platforms to send spear-phishing messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Consent Phishing:**
     - Consent phishing is a technique where attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious applications, often by sending emails with links to fake consent forms. This can be used to steal access tokens, which can then be used to gain unauthorized access to systems or services.
   - **Spear-Phishing via Social Media:**
     - Spear-phishing through social media involves targeting specific individuals with personalized messages that often contain malicious links or attachments. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a target's system.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - It is plausible that Iranian hackers would use consent phishing as a preliminary step to gain access tokens. These tokens can then be used to authenticate and gain access to systems, making subsequent spear-phishing attempts more effective.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that consent phishing is not a likely preliminary step. However, given the effectiveness of consent phishing in stealing access tokens, which can be used to facilitate further attacks, this answer is less plausible.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the effectiveness and common use of consent phishing in cyber attacks, it is more likely that Iranian hackers would use this technique to steal access tokens before moving on to more targeted spear-phishing via social media.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
