### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Enumeration of running processes.
     2. Gathering browser data (bookmarks and stored credentials).
     3. Collecting files by copying them from local systems and removable media.
     4. Targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Enumeration of Running Processes:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
   - **Gathering Browser Data:**
     - Collecting browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials is a logical next step to gather sensitive information.
   - **Collecting Files from Local Systems and Removable Media:**
     - This step involves gathering additional files that may contain valuable data. It is a common technique used to ensure a comprehensive data collection.
   - **Targeting and Exfiltrating Credentials from Password Stores:**
     - After collecting browser data and other files, targeting password stores is a logical step to gather more credentials, which can be used for further attacks or exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Reconnaissance (Enumeration of Running Processes):** This helps the attacker understand the environment.
     2. **Gathering Browser Data:** This provides immediate access to sensitive information.
     3. **Collecting Files from Local Systems and Removable Media:** This ensures a broader collection of data.
     4. **Targeting and Exfiltrating Credentials from Password Stores:** This step is often performed to gather additional credentials for further exploitation or exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical progression and common TTPs in cyber attacks, the sequence described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
