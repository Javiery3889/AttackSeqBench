### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using publicly available offensive security tools (SharpHound and PowerSploit) for reconnaissance during the Discovery phase.
     - Utilizing RDP traffic tunneled through deployed web shells for lateral movement.
     - Compromising additional IIS servers.
     - Establishing command and control (C2) with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - Using SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance is a common technique in the Discovery phase. These tools are often used to map network topology and gather information about the environment.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Tunneling RDP traffic through deployed web shells is a plausible method for lateral movement. Web shells can be used to maintain persistence and provide a backdoor for further attacks.
   - **Compromising Additional IIS Servers:**
     - Once the initial foothold is established, compromising additional IIS servers is a logical next step to expand the attacker's presence in the network.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Establishing C2 with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function is a sophisticated technique. It allows the attacker to maintain control over the compromised servers and potentially evade detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance is a well-documented and effective method for gathering information about the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Tunneling RDP traffic through web shells is a common technique for moving laterally within a network. Web shells provide a persistent backdoor and can be used to execute commands and transfer files.
   - **Compromising IIS Servers:**
     - Compromising additional IIS servers is a logical step after gaining initial access. IIS servers are often critical to the network and can provide a rich target for further exploitation.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Establishing C2 with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function is a sophisticated technique that can help the attacker maintain control and potentially evade detection. This is a plausible step after gaining access to multiple IIS servers.
