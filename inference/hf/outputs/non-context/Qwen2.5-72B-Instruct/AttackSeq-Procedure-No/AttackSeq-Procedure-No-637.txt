### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the PIVY variant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communication with C2 servers using application layer protocols.
     - Evasion of defenses by using DLL sideloading.
     - Modification of configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the PIVY variant will indeed use DLL sideloading to load a dropped DLL and modify its configuration to evade detection.
     - DLL sideloading is a common technique used by malware to evade detection by loading a legitimate application with a malicious DLL. This can help the malware blend in with normal system processes and avoid being detected by security tools.
     - Modifying configuration data to confuse tools parsing configuration data is another common evasion technique. By altering the configuration, the malware can make it harder for security tools to identify and analyze its behavior.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the PIVY variant will not use DLL sideloading or modify its configuration to evade detection.
     - This is less likely given the context of the question, which already mentions the use of C2 communication and the need to evade defenses.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question implies that the PIVY variant is already using sophisticated techniques to communicate with C2 servers and evade detection.
   - DLL sideloading and configuration modification are well-known techniques used by advanced malware to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - Given the context, it is highly plausible that the PIVY variant would use these additional techniques to further evade defenses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
