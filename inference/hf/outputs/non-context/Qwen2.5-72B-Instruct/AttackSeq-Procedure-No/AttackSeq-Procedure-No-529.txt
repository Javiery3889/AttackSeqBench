### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Dropping Elephant.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Targeting diplomatic and economic entities to gather victim identity information.
     2. Executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
     3. Using spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Targeting Diplomatic and Economic Entities to Gather Victim Identity Information**
     - This is a common initial reconnaissance phase where the threat actor gathers information about potential targets to tailor their attacks.
   - **Step 2: Executing UPX-packed Backdoors to Download Additional Malware**
     - This step involves deploying a backdoor, which is typically done after gaining initial access to the target system. The backdoor is used to maintain persistence and download additional malware.
   - **Step 3: Using Spear-Phishing Emails Containing Malicious Documents to Gain Initial Access**
     - Spear-phishing is a common technique used to gain initial access to a target system. It involves sending targeted emails with malicious attachments or links to trick the victim into executing the malware.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not logically consistent. Typically, the order of operations would be:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Gathering Victim Identity Information)**
     2. **Initial Access (Using Spear-Phishing Emails)**
     3. **Execution (Deploying Backdoors and Downloading Additional Malware)**
   - The question suggests that the backdoor is deployed before gaining initial access, which is not a typical sequence. Usually, the backdoor is deployed after gaining initial access through techniques like spear-phishing.

### Final Answer:
B: No
