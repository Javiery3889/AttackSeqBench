### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CosmicDuke, a known malware, has collected information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase.
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate the collected data over the same channel used for Command and Control (C2) during the Exfiltration phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - CosmicDuke is known for its sophisticated capabilities, including the use of multiple channels for different purposes. However, it is also known to use the same channel for both C2 and data exfiltration to reduce the number of network connections and avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that CosmicDuke uses different channels for C2 and data exfiltration. While this is possible, it is less common for malware to use separate channels for these purposes, as it increases the complexity and risk of detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - CosmicDuke is designed to be stealthy and efficient. Using the same channel for both C2 and data exfiltration helps in maintaining a low profile and reducing the number of network connections, which can help in evading detection.
   - Given the known behavior of CosmicDuke, it is more likely that it would use the same channel for both C2 and data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
