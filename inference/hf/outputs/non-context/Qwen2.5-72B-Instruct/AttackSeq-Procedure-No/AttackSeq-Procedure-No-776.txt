### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the NewPass implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a loader library to decode the configuration file.
     - Evading detection.
     - Initiating a download via FTP.
     - Exfiltrating information using encrypted POST requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Loader Library and Configuration File Decoding:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to load and decode configuration files, which often contain information about the next steps in the attack, such as C2 (Command and Control) server details.
   - **Evasion:**
     - Malware often employs various evasion techniques to avoid detection by security software. This can include obfuscation, polymorphism, and other methods.
   - **FTP Download:**
     - Downloading additional components or payloads via FTP is a plausible next step after decoding the configuration file and evading detection. This can be used to download additional malware or tools needed for further stages of the attack.
   - **Exfiltration via Encrypted POST Requests:**
     - Exfiltrating data using encrypted POST requests is a common method for sending stolen information back to the attacker's server. This is typically done after the malware has completed its initial setup and any necessary downloads.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Loader Library and Configuration File Decoding:** The malware decodes its configuration file to understand its next steps.
     2. **Evasion:** The malware evades detection to ensure it can continue its operations without being interrupted.
     3. **FTP Download:** The malware downloads additional components or payloads via FTP.
     4. **Exfiltration via Encrypted POST Requests:** The malware exfiltrates stolen information using encrypted POST requests.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of TTPs commonly used by malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
