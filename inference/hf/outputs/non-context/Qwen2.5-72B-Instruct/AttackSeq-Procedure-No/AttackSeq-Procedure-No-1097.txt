### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes exfiltrating data via FTP, using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searching removable drives while skipping certain file types.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration via FTP:** This is a common technique used by malware to send stolen data to a remote server.
   - **Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer:** These are tools used to gather additional information from the victim's system. They are often used in the data collection phase of an attack.
   - **Searching Removable Drives and Skipping Certain File Types:** This is a more specific data collection technique where the malware looks for data on removable drives but avoids certain file types.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Exfiltration First:** The question states that the data is exfiltrated first. This is unusual because typically, data collection (using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers) happens before exfiltration.
   - **Data Collection After Exfiltration:** If the data has already been exfiltrated, it doesn't make sense to gather more data using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers afterward, as the primary goal of exfiltration is to send the collected data to the attacker.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not logical. Typically, data collection (using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers) would occur before exfiltration, not after. Additionally, searching removable drives and skipping certain file types would also be part of the data collection phase, not after exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: No
