### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where ProjectM actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks. These are common techniques used to gain a foothold in a target network.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to perform reconnaissance to gather more information about the victim. This can include gathering identity information, network topology, and other useful data.
   - **Domain Registration:**
     - Registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services is typically done before the attack to set up infrastructure that can be used for various stages of the attack, including initial access and command and control (C2) communication.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where domain registration happens before the reconnaissance. This is a logical sequence because attackers often set up their infrastructure (including domains) before they start their attack to ensure they have the necessary resources in place.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of events, it is more likely that the ProjectM actors registered domains with or without WHOIS protection services before they gained initial access and then performed reconnaissance, including gathering victim identity information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
