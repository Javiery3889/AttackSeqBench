### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using the Run registry key to ensure persistence.
     2. Injecting decrypted shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Run Registry Key:**
     - The Run registry key is a common technique used by malware to ensure that it runs every time the system starts. This is a typical persistence mechanism.
   - **DLL Side-Loading:**
     - DLL Side-Loading is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, causing the legitimate application to load and execute the malicious code.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The question asks if APT10 is likely to inject decrypted shellcode into `svchost.exe` using DLL Side-Loading **only after** ensuring persistence via the Run registry key.
     - This implies a logical sequence where the attacker first ensures that the malware will run at startup (persistence) and then proceeds to execute the payload (in this case, injecting shellcode).

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Persistence First:**
     - Ensuring persistence is a critical first step for many APTs, including APT10. This ensures that the malware can survive system reboots and maintain a foothold in the system.
   - **Execution of Payload:**
     - After ensuring persistence, the attacker would then focus on executing the payload. DLL Side-Loading is a sophisticated technique that can be used to inject and execute malicious code in a trusted process like `svchost.exe`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the typical behavior of APT10, it is plausible that they would ensure persistence first and then proceed to execute the payload using DLL Side-Loading.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
