### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Naikon APT group has used the Aria-body backdoor to gather detailed system and network information during the Discovery tactic.
   - The question then asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for Command and Control (C2) communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:** The Aria-body backdoor is used to gather detailed system and network information. This is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the Discovery phase, where attackers gather information to understand the environment they have compromised.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Tactic:** After gathering information, the next logical step is to establish and maintain control over the compromised system. This is where C2 communications come into play.
   - **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA):** DGAs are used by malware to generate a large number of domain names that can be used for C2 communications. This technique is often used to evade detection and make it harder for defenders to block or take down C2 servers.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - DGAs are a common technique used by APT groups to maintain resilient C2 communications. Given that the Naikon APT group is known for sophisticated and persistent attacks, it is plausible that they would use DGAs to ensure their C2 infrastructure remains robust and difficult to disrupt.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - While it is possible that the Naikon APT group might not use DGAs, it is less likely given their advanced capabilities and the common use of DGAs in sophisticated APT operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
