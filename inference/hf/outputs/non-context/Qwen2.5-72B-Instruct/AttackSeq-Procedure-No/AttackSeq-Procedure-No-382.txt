### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method where APT15 gains entry through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - It then asks if APT15 is likely to use credential stuffing against the victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 has already gained initial access using stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials. This is a common and effective method for gaining initial access.
   - **Credential Stuffing:**
     - Credential stuffing is a technique where attackers use automated scripts to test large numbers of username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This technique is typically used when the attacker does not already have valid credentials.
     - Given that APT15 already has valid domain administrator credentials, the need for credential stuffing is less likely. They already have high-level access and can likely use these credentials to move laterally within the network.
   - **Deployment of Tools:**
     - RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS are tools used for execution evasion and command execution. These tools are typically used after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.
     - The deployment of these tools aligns with the post-compromise activities of APT15.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that APT15 already has valid domain administrator credentials, it is less likely that they would use credential stuffing to obtain additional valid accounts. They would more likely focus on using the credentials they already have to deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for further activities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
