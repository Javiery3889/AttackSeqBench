### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Hidden Cobra.
   - The sequence starts with the use of the Bankshot malware implant for reconnaissance.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra would proceed to send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials during the same reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The reconnaissance phase is typically the initial stage of an attack where the adversary gathers information about the target.
     - Using malware like Bankshot to collect information is a common technique in this phase.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Credential harvesting is a technique used to obtain valid login credentials, which is often part of the initial access or execution phase, not necessarily the reconnaissance phase.
     - Impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials is a social engineering technique that is more likely to occur after the initial reconnaissance to gain access to the network.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The use of Bankshot for reconnaissance is a logical first step.
     - Sending Telegram messages to impersonate IT personnel and harvest credentials is a subsequent step that would typically follow the initial reconnaissance to gain access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that credential harvesting via social engineering is more likely to occur after the initial reconnaissance phase, it is not likely that Hidden Cobra would send Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel during the same reconnaissance phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
