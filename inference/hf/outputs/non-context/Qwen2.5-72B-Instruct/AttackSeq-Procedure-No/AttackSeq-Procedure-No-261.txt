### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving a malicious document with embedded macros, the Dridex loader, RC4 encryption, and the use of the `OutputDebugStringW` function for anti-debugging.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Infection Vector:** Malicious documents with embedded macros.
   - **Payload Delivery:** Macros download the Dridex loader.
   - **Obfuscation:** Dridex loader uses RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings.
   - **Anti-Debugging:** Dridex loader uses the `OutputDebugStringW` function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Malicious Documents with Embedded Macros:**
     - This is a common initial infection vector used by various malware, including Dridex. When a user opens the document, the macros execute and download the payload.
   - **Dridex Loader:**
     - Dridex is a well-known banking trojan that often uses a loader to deliver its payload. The loader is responsible for establishing persistence and downloading additional components.
   - **RC4 Encryption:**
     - RC4 is a stream cipher that has been used in various malware for obfuscation purposes. It can be used to encrypt strings and other data to evade detection by security tools.
   - **OutputDebugStringW Function:**
     - The `OutputDebugStringW` function is often used by malware for anti-debugging purposes. It can be used to detect the presence of a debugger by sending debug messages that are not typically seen in a non-debugged environment.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Dridex is known to use sophisticated techniques to evade detection, including string obfuscation and anti-debugging measures.
   - The use of RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and the `OutputDebugStringW` function for anti-debugging are consistent with the behavior of Dridex and other advanced malware.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
