### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes the use of an Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Collecting mail from accessed systems and servers is a common post-exploitation activity for many threat actors, including Gamaredon.
     - This activity can provide valuable intelligence, such as sensitive information, credentials, and insights into the target's operations.
     - Given that Gamaredon has already used sophisticated methods to gain access and move laterally, it is logical to assume they would also engage in data collection to maximize the value of their compromise.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Gamaredon would not collect mail from accessed systems and servers.
     - However, this is less likely given the group's known tactics and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs includes the collection of mail from accessed systems and servers as part of the group's collection activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
