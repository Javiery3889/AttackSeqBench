### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by ProjectM actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Conducting reconnaissance by identifying targets through searches on open websites and domains.
     2. Collecting location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
     3. Executing Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans.
     - This is plausible because:
       - Collecting location information can help attackers tailor their attacks more effectively.
       - Phishing sites often gather various types of information, including location data, to enhance the credibility of their attacks.
       - This step fits logically between reconnaissance and the execution of Trojans, as it provides additional context and targeting information.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that ProjectM actors did not collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - It would be unusual for sophisticated actors to skip a step that could provide valuable information for their attacks.
       - Location data can be crucial for tailoring phishing emails and making them more convincing.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of sophisticated cyber actors, the most plausible answer is that ProjectM actors did collect location information from visitors to their phishing sites before moving forward with executing Trojans.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
