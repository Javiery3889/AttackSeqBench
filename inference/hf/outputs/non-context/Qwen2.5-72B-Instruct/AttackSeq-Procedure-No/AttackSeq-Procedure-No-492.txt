### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP Protocol for C2 Communication:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is primarily used for transferring files between computers on a network. It is not typically used for C2 communication because it is not designed for the secure and stealthy communication that is often required in C2 operations.
     - C2 communication usually requires protocols that are more secure and less likely to be detected by network security systems. Common C2 protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and custom protocols.
   - **Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon are known for their ability to use various protocols for C2 communication, including HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS. They are designed to blend in with normal network traffic to avoid detection.
     - Using FTP for C2 communication would be unusual and less effective for these tools, as it would be more likely to trigger network security alerts.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the nature of C2 communication and the capabilities of Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon, it is unlikely that they would use FTP for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B: No**
