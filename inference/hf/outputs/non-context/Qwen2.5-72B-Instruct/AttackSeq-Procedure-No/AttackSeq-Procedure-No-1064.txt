### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor "Yellow Garuda."
   - The first TTP is maintaining persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template with a malicious macro-enabled template file.
   - The question then asks if Yellow Garuda is likely to use right-to-left override (RLO) to obfuscate the filenames of malicious e-mail attachments for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Maintaining Persistence with Malicious Macro-Enabled Template:**
     - This is a common technique used by threat actors to ensure that every time a user opens a Word document, the malicious macro is executed, maintaining persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Right-to-Left Override (RLO) for Filename Obfuscation:**
     - RLO is a Unicode character that can be used to reverse the display order of characters in a string. This can be used to obfuscate filenames, making them appear benign to the user.
     - For example, a file named "important.docx" could be obfuscated to appear as "tnednem.docx" when the RLO character is used.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Using RLO to obfuscate filenames is a technique that can help evade detection by making the malicious file appear less suspicious to the user and possibly to automated detection systems.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given that Yellow Garuda has already used a sophisticated technique to maintain persistence (replacing the default Word template with a malicious one), it is reasonable to assume that they would also use additional techniques to evade detection.
   - RLO is a relatively simple and effective method for obfuscating filenames, which aligns with the goal of defense evasion.
