### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the DNSpionage attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE.
     - Conducting reconnaissance.
     - Leveraging two fake websites.
     - Generating Let's Encrypt certificates.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance** is typically one of the first steps in a cyber attack. It involves gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack.
   - **Targeting specific domains** suggests that the attackers already have some knowledge of the targets, which is often a result of reconnaissance.
   - **Leveraging fake websites** and **generating Let's Encrypt certificates** are actions that follow reconnaissance and are part of the resource development phase.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - If the attackers targeted specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE, it is highly likely that they conducted reconnaissance to identify these targets.
   - The sequence of TTPs suggests that reconnaissance would have been conducted before targeting specific domains, not after.
   - Therefore, the statement that reconnaissance was conducted only after targeting specific domains is not plausible.

### Final Answer: B: No
