### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the Duke group using Seaduke to securely communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.
   - Seaduke is known for its use of multiple layers of encryption and encoding for C2 communications.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Duke group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using the same channel for both C2 and data exfiltration can be efficient and reduce the risk of detection. Since the channel is already secure and established, it makes sense to leverage it for data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - Using a different channel for data exfiltration might be considered to avoid overloading the C2 channel or to use a different method that might be less detectable. However, this would require additional setup and resources.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The Duke group is known for their sophisticated and efficient use of malware and communication channels.
   - Seaduke's multiple layers of encryption and encoding provide a secure and reliable channel for C2.
   - Leveraging the same secure channel for data exfiltration would be a logical and efficient approach, as it minimizes the need for additional setup and reduces the risk of detection by using a channel that is already well-protected.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
