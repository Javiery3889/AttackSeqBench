### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Raccoon stealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Execution Phase:** Collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data.
     - **Defense Evasion:** Embedding a base64-encoded payload within a LNK file to bypass blocking.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Communicating with C&C servers using Telegram features.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data is a common technique used by stealer malware like Raccoon. This aligns with the Execution phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Embedding a base64-encoded payload within a LNK file is a known technique for evading detection and blocking mechanisms. This aligns with the Defense Evasion phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Using Telegram features for C2 communication is a plausible method for maintaining control over the compromised system. Telegram's end-to-end encryption and widespread use make it an attractive choice for C2 communication.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - Raccoon stealer is known for collecting various types of data, including system and account information and crypto wallet data. This is a typical behavior for a stealer malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Embedding a base64-encoded payload within a LNK file is a common technique to bypass security measures. LNK files (shortcuts) are often used to execute malicious payloads without raising suspicion.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - Using Telegram for C2 communication is a known technique. Telegram's features, such as secret chats and the ability to send files, make it a suitable platform for C2 operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the plausibility and alignment of each step in the sequence with known TTPs of Raccoon stealer, the most likely answer is that Raccoon stealer did indeed follow this sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
