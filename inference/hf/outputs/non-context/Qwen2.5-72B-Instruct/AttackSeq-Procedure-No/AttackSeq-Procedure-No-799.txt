### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group FIN4.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Transmitting stolen credentials to C2 (Command and Control) servers for credential access.
     2. Using spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials.
     3. Labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Transmitting Stolen Credentials to C2 Servers:**
     - This is a common TTP for many threat groups, including FIN4. Once credentials are stolen, they are often transmitted to C2 servers for further use.
   - **Using Spearphishing Emails with Embedded VBA Macros:**
     - FIN4 is known for using spearphishing emails to deliver malware, often with embedded VBA macros. These macros can be used to prompt victims for additional credentials, such as Outlook credentials.
   - **Labeling the Origin of Stolen Credentials Using Unique 'Campaign Codes':**
     - Threat groups often use unique identifiers or 'campaign codes' to track the origin of stolen data. This helps in managing and organizing their operations.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with known TTPs of FIN4:
     1. **Transmitting Stolen Credentials to C2 Servers:** This is a standard step in the attack lifecycle.
     2. **Using Spearphishing Emails with Embedded VBA Macros:** This is a known technique used by FIN4 to gain further access.
     3. **Labeling the Origin of Stolen Credentials Using Unique 'Campaign Codes':** This is a common practice for resource development and management.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence and alignment with known TTPs of FIN4, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
