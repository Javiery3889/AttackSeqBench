### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Scote malware.
   - The malware provides backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers achieved initial access through content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies to redirect victims to download malicious files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Content Injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB:**
     - Content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies is a technique where attackers manipulate responses to these protocols to redirect victims to malicious resources.
     - This can be used to achieve initial access by tricking victims into downloading and executing malicious files.
   - **Scote Malware:**
     - The Scote malware is known for providing backdoor access and collecting C2 information from various sources.
     - The question does not explicitly state how the initial access was achieved, but it implies that the malware is already present and operational.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that the attackers used content injection to achieve initial access, as this is a common technique for redirecting victims to download malware.
     - However, the question does not provide direct evidence that this was the method used in this specific case.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information provided, it is reasonable to consider content injection as a plausible method for achieving initial access, but the question does not provide enough specific evidence to confirm this with certainty.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "No" because the question does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively state that content injection was used.

**Final Answer: B: No**
