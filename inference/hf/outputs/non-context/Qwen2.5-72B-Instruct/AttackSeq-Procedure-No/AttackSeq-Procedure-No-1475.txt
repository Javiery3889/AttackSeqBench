### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions that Seaduke, a known malware, might take after communicating with its Command and Control (C&C) server.
   - The actions include:
     - Communicating with the C&C server using layers of encoding and encryption.
     - Utilizing its payload to:
       - Retrieve detailed bot/system information.
       - Update configurations.
       - Upload/download files.
       - Securely delete itself.
     - Archiving sensitive information.
     - Exfiltrating data via legitimate cloud services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke is likely to perform all the actions listed.
     - Seaduke is a sophisticated malware known for its capabilities in communication with C&C servers, retrieving system information, updating configurations, and exfiltrating data.
     - The sequence of actions described is consistent with the behavior of advanced malware, which often includes multiple stages of operation to achieve its objectives.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Seaduke is not likely to perform all the actions listed.
     - Given the sophistication and capabilities of Seaduke, it is highly unlikely that it would not perform these actions, as they are typical for such malware.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with the behavior of Seaduke, which is known for its advanced capabilities and multi-stage operations.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
