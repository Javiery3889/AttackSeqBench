### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using an obfuscated batch script to execute a PowerShell script (`myScript.ps1`).
     - Using njRAT to establish command and control (C2) over the victim's computer.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscated Batch Script and PowerShell Script Execution:**
     - Obfuscation is often used to evade detection by security tools and to hide the true nature of the script.
     - Executing a PowerShell script is a common technique for performing various malicious activities, including downloading additional payloads, executing commands, and establishing persistence.
   - **njRAT and Command and Control:**
     - njRAT (New Jersey RAT) is a remote access trojan that allows attackers to control a victim's computer remotely.
     - Once C2 is established, the attacker has the ability to perform a wide range of actions, including maintaining persistence.

3. **Evaluate the Likelihood of Maintaining Persistence:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Maintaining persistence is a common goal for attackers after gaining initial access and establishing C2.
     - Techniques for maintaining persistence include creating scheduled tasks, modifying registry keys, or adding startup entries to ensure that the malware runs every time the system starts or the user logs in.
   - **Context:**
     - Given that the attacker has already used sophisticated techniques (obfuscation, PowerShell, njRAT) to gain control, it is highly likely that they will take additional steps to ensure they maintain access to the victim's system.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
