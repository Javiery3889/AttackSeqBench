### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Compromising Managed Service Provider (MSP) credentials.
     2. Using these credentials to gain higher-level permissions (e.g., domain administrator).
     3. Retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
     4. Using the `enum_secrets` module for OS credential dumping.
     5. Employing DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromising MSP Credentials and Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT10 is known for compromising MSP credentials and using them to gain higher-level permissions. This is a common TTP for APT10 and aligns with their known behavior.
   - **Retrieving Secrets from AWS Secrets Manager:**
     - APT10 has been known to target cloud services, including AWS, to steal sensitive information. However, the specific technique of using the `enum_secrets` module to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager is not a well-documented TTP for APT10.
   - **Using `enum_secrets` for OS Credential Dumping:**
     - The `enum_secrets` module is typically used for dumping credentials from the operating system, not from cloud services. This step seems out of place in the context of AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **DLL Load Order Hijacking:**
     - DLL load order hijacking is a technique used to execute malicious code by placing a malicious DLL in a specific directory. This technique is often used to gain persistence or to execute code with elevated privileges. However, it is not typically used in the context of retrieving secrets from a cloud service.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The first two steps (compromising MSP credentials and privilege escalation) are plausible and align with APT10's known TTPs.
   - The third step (retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager) is plausible but the use of the `enum_secrets` module for this purpose is not typical.
   - The fourth step (DLL load order hijacking) is a common technique but is not typically used in the context of cloud service secret retrieval.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible sequence of TTPs for APT10. The use of the `enum_secrets` module for retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and the application of DLL load order hijacking in this context are not well-supported by known APT10 TTPs.

**Final Answer: B: No**
