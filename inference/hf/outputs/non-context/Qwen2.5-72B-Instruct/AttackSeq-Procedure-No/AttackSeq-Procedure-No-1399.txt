### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltrating data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.
     - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
     - Archiving the collected data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.
     - Using proxies for communication and command and control (C2).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration over Web Services:**
     - FIN13 is known to use web shells and JSP tools for exfiltrating data. This is a common technique for data exfiltration, especially in web-based environments.
   - **Collecting Sensitive Data:**
     - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives is a typical step in the data exfiltration process. This ensures that the threat actor has access to the data they want to exfiltrate.
   - **Archiving Data:**
     - Archiving the collected data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries is a logical step to prepare the data for exfiltration. This can help in compressing the data to make the exfiltration process more efficient.
   - **Using Proxies for C2:**
     - Using proxies for communication and C2 is a common technique to obfuscate the true source of the commands and to maintain a low profile. However, the question asks if this is done **only after** the data has been collected and archived.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that FIN13 would use proxies for C2 only after the data has been collected and archived. This is not a typical sequence of events. Usually, threat actors establish C2 channels early in the attack to maintain control over the compromised environment and to facilitate the exfiltration process.
   - It is more plausible that FIN13 would use proxies for C2 from the beginning of the attack, including during the data collection and archiving phases, to maintain control and ensure the exfiltration process is not interrupted.

### Final Answer:
B: No
