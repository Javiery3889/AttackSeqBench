### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - After gaining access, the attacker executes Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TA505 will fork itself and run the fork with the `--init` flag, leaving it to be inherited by the legitimate process `init` for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - The initial access is gained through a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) in SolarWinds Serv-U.
     - This is a common method for gaining initial access and is consistent with the tactics used by various threat actors, including TA505.
   - **Execution of Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - Cobalt Strike Beacon is a well-known post-exploitation tool used by many threat actors, including TA505.
     - Using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to execute Cobalt Strike Beacon is a common technique to evade detection.
   - **Forking and Inheritance:**
     - The question specifically asks about forking and running the fork with the `--init` flag, which is a technique used for process hollowing or process injection.
     - Process hollowing involves creating a new process in a suspended state, replacing its memory with malicious code, and then resuming the process.
     - The `--init` flag and the use of the `init` process for inheritance is not a standard or commonly known technique for process hollowing or defense evasion.
     - TA505 is known for using various techniques for defense evasion, but the specific method described in the question (forking with `--init` and inheriting by `init`) is not a well-documented or typical method used by this threat actor.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access and execution of Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands are consistent with the tactics used by TA505.
   - However, the specific technique of forking with the `--init` flag and inheriting by the `init` process is not a known or typical method used by TA505 for defense evasion.
   - Given the lack of evidence and the unusual nature of the described technique, it is unlikely that TA505 would use this specific method.
