### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tropic Trooper group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Defense Evasion**: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to load a malicious DLL (wab32res.dll) through a benign file.
     - **Command and Control (C2)**: The question asks if it is likely that TClient will use email for C2 via an Office macro.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (DLL Hijacking):**
     - DLL hijacking is a technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location that is searched by a legitimate program before the legitimate DLL. This allows the malicious DLL to be loaded and executed, effectively hiding the malicious activity.
   - **Command and Control (C2) via Email and Office Macro:**
     - Email is a common method for C2, but it is typically used in conjunction with other techniques to establish and maintain communication with the attacker.
     - Office macros can be used to execute malicious code and establish C2, but they are more commonly associated with the initial infection vector (e.g., phishing emails) rather than the C2 phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **DLL Hijacking and C2:**
     - DLL hijacking is a sophisticated technique that is often used to maintain persistence and evade detection. It is less likely to be directly linked to the C2 phase, which typically involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker.
   - **Email and Office Macros:**
     - While email and Office macros are common in the initial infection phase, they are less likely to be the primary method for C2 in a sophisticated attack like Tropic Trooper. More advanced C2 methods, such as using legitimate protocols (e.g., HTTPS) or custom protocols, are more common in the C2 phase.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophistication of Tropic Trooper and the use of DLL hijacking for defense evasion, it is less likely that they would use a less sophisticated method like email and Office macros for C2. Instead, they would likely use more advanced and stealthy methods to maintain communication with the compromised system.

### Final Answer: B: No
