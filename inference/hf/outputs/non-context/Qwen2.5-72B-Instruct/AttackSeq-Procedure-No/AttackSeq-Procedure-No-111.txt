### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Installing additional persistence points on new systems.
     2. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement.
     3. Gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement only after they have gained knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.
     - This aligns with the typical attack sequence in the MITRE ATT&CK framework:
       - **Persistence**: Installing additional persistence points.
       - **Discovery**: Gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data.
       - **Lateral Movement**: Exploiting remote services to move to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement without first gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.
     - This is less likely because effective lateral movement typically requires knowledge of the target environment to avoid detection and to move efficiently.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The typical sequence in a cyber attack involves:
     1. **Initial Access**: Gaining entry into the target network.
     2. **Persistence**: Ensuring continued access by installing additional persistence points.
     3. **Discovery**: Gathering information about the network, systems, users, and data.
     4. **Lateral Movement**: Using the information gathered to move to other systems within the network.
   - Given this sequence, it is logical that attackers would exploit remote services for lateral movement only after they have gained the necessary knowledge through the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
