### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that involves acquiring infrastructure (domains) for command and control (C2) servers during the resource development phase.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the attackers initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to execute code on victim systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - Acquiring infrastructure such as domains is a common step in the resource development phase of an attack. This is where attackers set up the necessary infrastructure to support their operations, including C2 servers.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing with malicious attachments is a common technique used for initial access. CVE-2021-40444 is a specific vulnerability that can be exploited to execute code on victim systems, making it a plausible choice for such an attack.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression: first, the attackers acquire the necessary infrastructure, and then they use a spear phishing campaign to gain initial access to the victim's systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of events and the common use of spear phishing with specific vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-40444, it is indeed likely that the attackers initiated the attack in this manner.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
