### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the POWERSHOWER malware.
   - Specifically, it asks whether POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 (Command and Control) server only after sending system information to the C2 server and before collecting more system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence mentioned in the question is:
     1. POWERSHOWER sends system information to the C2 server.
     2. POWERSHOWER enters a communications loop with the C2 server.
     3. POWERSHOWER collects more system information on the infected machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server only after sending system information and before collecting more system information.
     - This is plausible because it is common for malware to establish a persistent communication channel with the C2 server after initial data exfiltration to receive further commands or instructions.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that POWERSHOWER will not enter a communications loop with the C2 server only after sending system information and before collecting more system information.
     - This is less plausible because it implies that POWERSHOWER would skip the communication loop, which is a critical step for receiving further commands and maintaining control over the infected machine.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware, it is more likely that POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server after sending initial system information. This allows the attacker to maintain control and issue further commands, which may include collecting more system information.

### Final Answer: B: No

The correct answer is B: No, because it is more plausible that POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server after sending initial system information, rather than only before collecting more system information.
