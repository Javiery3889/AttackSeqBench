### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used Arabic language decoy documents in a phishing campaign to gain initial access.
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 (Command and Control) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only after the initial access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The use of Arabic language decoy documents in a phishing campaign is a common technique for initial access. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1566 (Phishing) technique.
   - **Backdoor Access and C2:**
     - Scote malware is known to provide backdoor access, which is a common post-compromise activity.
     - Collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles is a method to establish and maintain command and control (C2) communication. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) and T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) techniques.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question implies a sequence where the initial access is followed by the deployment of Scote malware, which then collects C2 information.
     - This sequence is logical and aligns with typical attack patterns where initial access is followed by the establishment of a persistent backdoor and C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of events and the alignment with common attack patterns, it is likely that the Scote malware provided backdoor access by collecting C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles only after the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
