### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the BlackEnergy Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Connecting to a hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80.
     - Issuing an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.
     - Ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on every system boot.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will indeed create a LNK file in the system startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan will not create a LNK file in the system startup folder to ensure persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Connecting to C&C Server:**
     - It is common for malware to connect to a C&C server to send victim information and receive further instructions.
   - **HTTP POST Request with BASE64-encoded Data:**
     - Encoding data in BASE64 is a common technique to obfuscate the data being sent, making it harder to detect.
   - **Ensuring Persistence:**
     - Ensuring persistence is a critical step for malware to maintain control over the infected system. One common method is to create a LNK file in the system startup folder.
     - The command "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" is a known technique used by malware to execute a malicious DLL file. This is a plausible method for ensuring persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the common practices of malware, especially trojans like BlackEnergy, it is highly likely that the trojan will ensure persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
