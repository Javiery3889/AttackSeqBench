### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery:** The malware queries the registry to identify victim machines.
     - **Persistence:** The malware adds Intel-related files to registry run keys.
     - **Defense Evasion:** The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (Querying the Registry):**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to gather information about the victim's system. Malware often queries the registry to find out details about the operating system, installed software, and other system configurations.
   - **Persistence (Adding Intel-related Files to Registry Run Keys):**
     - Adding files to registry run keys is a well-known method for achieving persistence. By doing this, the malware ensures that it runs every time the system starts.
   - **Defense Evasion (Impersonating a Legitimate Symantec Executable):**
     - Impersonating a legitimate executable is a common technique for evading detection by security software. Symantec is a well-known security software, and impersonating its executables can help the malware avoid being flagged as malicious.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible. Malware often follows a logical sequence of actions:
     1. **Discovery:** Gather information about the victim's system.
     2. **Persistence:** Ensure that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Avoid detection by security software.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these techniques, the most plausible answer is that the malware will indeed achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
