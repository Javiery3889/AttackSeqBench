### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Emissary Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Exploiting a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access.
     2. Installing webshells on SharePoint servers.
     3. Sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials.
     4. Scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access and installing webshells on SharePoint servers is a plausible and well-documented TTP. This aligns with known APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups' behavior.
   - **Credential Harvesting:**
     - Sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials is a less common TTP. Typically, APT groups use more sophisticated methods such as phishing emails, credential dumping from memory, or exploiting vulnerabilities in authentication services.
   - **Network Scanning:**
     - Scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) is a common TTP. This vulnerability was widely exploited in the WannaCry ransomware attack and is often used by various threat actors for lateral movement.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Webshell Installation:**
     - This part of the sequence is highly plausible and aligns with known APT behavior.
   - **Credential Harvesting via Telegram:**
     - While credential harvesting is a common TTP, using Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel is less common and less effective compared to other methods. APT groups typically use more sophisticated and targeted methods for credential harvesting.
   - **Network Scanning:**
     - Scanning for vulnerable systems using tools targeting CVE-2017-0144 is a logical next step after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.

### Final Answer
Given the less common and less effective method of credential harvesting via Telegram messages, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
