### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files (Discovery phase) only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz (Credential Access phase).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Credential Access:** Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** Collecting system information and probing files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (Mimikatz):** FamousSparrow is known to use custom versions of Mimikatz to dump credentials. This is a common technique used to gain additional access and move laterally within a network.
   - **Discovery (System Information and File Probing):** After gaining credentials, it is logical for an attacker to perform discovery to understand the environment better. This includes collecting system information and probing files to identify valuable data, network configurations, and potential targets for further exploitation.

4. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question (Credential Access followed by Discovery) is a common and logical progression in an attack. Attackers often need credentials to perform more extensive discovery and to move laterally within a network.
   - FamousSparrow, being a sophisticated threat actor, would likely follow this sequence to maximize their chances of success and minimize detection.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical progression and the known tactics of FamousSparrow, it is likely that they would collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
