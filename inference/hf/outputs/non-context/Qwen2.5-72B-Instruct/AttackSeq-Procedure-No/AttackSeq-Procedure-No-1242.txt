### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting data using crafted modules like `pr.dll`.
     - Uploading stolen information to the C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more.
     - Targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will indeed divide files if they are 16 MB or larger.
     - This is a plausible TTP because large files can be more difficult to transfer over the network without attracting attention. Dividing files can help in evading detection and ensuring successful exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that APT28 will not divide files if they are 16 MB or larger.
     - This is less plausible because it would be more risky to transfer large files in a single chunk, especially when targeting high-value targets like political figures and the aerospace industry, where network monitoring is likely to be more stringent.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - APT28 is known for its sophisticated and stealthy operations.
     - Dividing files into smaller chunks is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection and ensure successful data exfiltration.
     - Given the high-value targets (political figures and the aerospace industry), APT28 would likely employ such techniques to minimize the risk of detection.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 will divide files if they are 16 MB or larger.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
