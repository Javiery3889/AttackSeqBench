### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Darkhotel APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.
     - Using 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
     - Seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware that is downloaded thousands of times for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Maintaining Persistence:**
     - Adding autorun registry settings is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs every time the system starts. This is a plausible step for maintaining persistence.
   - **Using 0-day Exploits:**
     - 0-day exploits are highly valuable and are typically used in targeted attacks to gain initial access or to escalate privileges. They are not commonly used after initial access has been established, especially in a broad, untargeted manner.
   - **Seeding P2P Sharing Sites:**
     - Seeding malware on P2P sharing sites is a method to gain initial access to a large number of victims. This is a broad, untargeted approach.
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that Darkhotel APT would use 0-day exploits after gaining initial access through P2P sharing sites and then maintain persistence through autorun registry settings.
     - This sequence is not typical for APT groups. APT groups usually use 0-day exploits for initial access or to bypass security measures, not after gaining initial access through a less sophisticated method like P2P sharing sites.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The use of 0-day exploits after gaining initial access through P2P sharing sites is not a common or logical sequence for an APT group like Darkhotel.
     - APT groups typically use 0-day exploits to gain initial access or to escalate privileges, not as a follow-up to a broad, untargeted initial access method.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - The sequence described in the question is not plausible for Darkhotel APT.

**Final Answer: B: No**
