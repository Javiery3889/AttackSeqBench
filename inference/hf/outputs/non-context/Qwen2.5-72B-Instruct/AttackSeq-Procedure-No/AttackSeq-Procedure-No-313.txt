### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dragonfly group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Defense Evasion:** Using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Using the remote-desktop protocol (RDP) to move laterally among internal or external systems.
     - **Discovery:** Focusing on Windows systems to gather system information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion (Self-deleting code):**
     - This is a common technique used by advanced threat actors to avoid detection and forensic analysis. It aligns with the Dragonfly group's known capabilities.
   - **Lateral Movement (RDP):**
     - RDP is a widely used protocol for remote access and is often exploited by attackers to move laterally within a network. This is a plausible next step after evading defenses.
   - **Discovery (Gathering system information):**
     - Once an attacker has moved laterally, they often need to gather information about the systems they have compromised to understand the network topology and identify valuable targets. This is a logical step in the attack lifecycle.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Defense Evasion:** The attacker uses self-deleting code to cover their tracks.
     2. **Lateral Movement:** The attacker uses RDP to move to other systems.
     3. **Discovery:** The attacker gathers system information to understand the environment.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described is consistent with the known behavior of the Dragonfly group and follows a logical attack pattern.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
