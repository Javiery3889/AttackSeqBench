### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for a malicious app called "callCam."
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading detection through overlay screens during installation.
     - Encrypting data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Evading Detection:**
     - Using overlay screens to evade detection is a common technique in mobile malware to trick users into granting permissions or to hide malicious activities.
   - **Encrypting Data:**
     - Encrypting data before exfiltration is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the data being sent to the C&C server.
     - RSA and AES are widely used encryption algorithms for this purpose.
   - **Collecting Files and Screenshots:**
     - Collecting files and screenshots is a typical data exfiltration technique used by malware to gather sensitive information from the compromised device.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern in malware operations:
     1. **Evade Detection:** The malware uses overlay screens to avoid being detected during installation.
     2. **Encrypt Data:** The malware encrypts the data it intends to exfiltrate to ensure it remains confidential during transmission.
     3. **Collect Data:** The malware then collects files and screenshots from the compromised device.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible and aligns with known malware behavior.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the callCam app will follow this sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
