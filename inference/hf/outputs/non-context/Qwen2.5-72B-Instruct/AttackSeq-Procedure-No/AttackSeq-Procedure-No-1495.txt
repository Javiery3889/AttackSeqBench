### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Charming Kitten group.
   - The sequence starts with the Reconnaissance phase, where Charming Kitten impersonates well-known researchers or journalists to target non-Iranian researchers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials only during the Resource Development phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - In the Reconnaissance phase, the attacker gathers information about the target. This can include identifying potential victims, understanding their interests, and creating a profile of the target.
     - Impersonating well-known researchers or journalists is a common tactic in this phase to gain the trust of the target and gather more information.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The Resource Development phase involves preparing the necessary tools and infrastructure to carry out the attack. This can include creating fake websites, developing malware, and setting up command and control (C2) infrastructure.
     - Creating fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials is a technique that can be used in the Resource Development phase to prepare for credential harvesting.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. Charming Kitten would first gather information about the target during the Reconnaissance phase and then use that information to create fake websites in the Resource Development phase to obtain credentials.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that the fake websites were created **only** during the Resource Development phase. This implies that the fake websites were not used in the Reconnaissance phase, which is a reasonable assumption because the primary goal of the Reconnaissance phase is information gathering, not credential harvesting.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence and the specific phrasing of the question, it is likely that the fake websites were created during the Resource Development phase, but not exclusively during this phase. The fake websites could also be used in the Execution phase to actually harvest credentials.

### Final Answer: B: No
