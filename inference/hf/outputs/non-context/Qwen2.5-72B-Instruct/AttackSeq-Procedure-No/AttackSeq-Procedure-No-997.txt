### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of a zero-day exploit in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Infection:** Use of a zero-day exploit in a Word document to deliver Plexor malware.
   - **Post-Infection Activities:** System fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
   - **Evasion Techniques:** Following guidelines to avoid detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - System fingerprinting and discovery are common post-infection activities to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
       - Espionage-focused malware often needs to gather information about the system to determine the best course of action and to avoid detection.
       - Following guidelines to avoid detection is a standard practice in advanced malware to maintain persistence and avoid being discovered by security systems.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that it is not likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - This would imply that the malware would not gather necessary information about the system, which is crucial for effective espionage.
       - Avoiding detection without understanding the environment would be less effective and could lead to the malware being discovered and removed.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the reasoning, it is more plausible that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before following guidelines to avoid detection. This aligns with the typical behavior of advanced malware, especially in espionage scenarios.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
