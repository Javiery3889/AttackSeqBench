### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the authors of Hacking Team's spyware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access.
     - Using a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system.
     - Establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of spearphishing emails with a PDF file to gain initial access is a common TTP. This aligns with the initial stage of the attack.
   - **Hidden File System:**
     - The use of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system is a more specific and less common TTP. It suggests a sophisticated method to hide data and maintain persistence.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Establishing communication with C&C servers is a standard TTP for maintaining control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Hacking Team's Spyware:**
     - Hacking Team is known for developing sophisticated spyware and malware. They often use advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
     - The use of a hidden file system (FAT16 partition image) in %TEMP% is a sophisticated method that aligns with the known capabilities of Hacking Team.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence described (spearphishing, hidden file system, C&C communication) is logically consistent and aligns with the typical stages of a cyber attack.

### Final Reasoning:
- Given the sophistication of Hacking Team's spyware and the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that they used a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system before establishing communication with C&C servers.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
