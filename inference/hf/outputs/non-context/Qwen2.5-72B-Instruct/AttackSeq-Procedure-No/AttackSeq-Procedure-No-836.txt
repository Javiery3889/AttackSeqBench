### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rocra attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a multi-functional framework to evade defenses via alternative communication channels.
     - Exploring the local area network using admin credentials for scanning.
     - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct internal spearphishing attacks against executives, HR, and IT personnel during lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs Mentioned:**
     - **Evasion via Alternative Communication Channels:** This is a common technique used to avoid detection by security systems. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's "Command and Control" and "Defense Evasion" tactics.
     - **Exploring the Local Area Network Using Admin Credentials for Scanning:** This involves using legitimate credentials to map out the network and identify potential targets. This aligns with the "Discovery" and "Credential Access" tactics.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is the process of moving through a network to access additional systems and resources. It often involves using stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using legitimate administrative tools.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:**
     - Internal spearphishing involves sending targeted phishing emails to specific individuals within the organization, often to gain further access or to gather sensitive information. This aligns with the "Initial Access" and "Execution" tactics.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of Internal Spearphishing:**
     - Given that the attackers have already gained access to the network and are using admin credentials to explore it, it is plausible that they might use internal spearphishing as part of their lateral movement strategy.
     - Internal spearphishing can be an effective way to gain additional credentials or to compromise specific high-value targets (like executives, HR, and IT personnel) who may have access to sensitive information or higher-level privileges.
     - The use of admin credentials for scanning suggests that the attackers are already in a position to gather information about the network and its users, which can be used to craft convincing spearphishing emails.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the described sequence of TTPs and the common practices of advanced attackers, it is likely that the Rocra attackers will conduct internal spearphishing attacks during lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
