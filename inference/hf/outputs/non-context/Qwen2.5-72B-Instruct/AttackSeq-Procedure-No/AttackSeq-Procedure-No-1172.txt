### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Taidoor malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Avoiding Detection:** The malware uses a downloader to decrypt a modified version of itself.
     - **Command-and-Control (C2) Communications:** The question asks if it is likely that the malware uses steganography to hide its C2 communications.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Avoiding Detection:**
     - The use of a downloader to decrypt a modified version of the malware is a common technique to avoid detection by security software. This is known as **Obfuscation** and is part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2) Communications:**
     - Steganography is a technique where data is hidden within other data, such as images or audio files, to avoid detection. It is used to hide the presence of C2 communications.
     - While steganography is a valid technique for hiding C2 communications, it is not the most common method used by malware like Taidoor. More common techniques include:
       - **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):** Generate a large number of domain names to communicate with C2 servers.
       - **HTTPS/SSL/TLS Encryption:** Encrypt C2 traffic to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
       - **DNS Tunneling:** Use DNS requests to exfiltrate data or receive commands.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given that steganography is not the most common method for C2 communications in malware like Taidoor, and considering the more prevalent techniques such as encryption and DNS tunneling, it is less likely that Taidoor would use steganography for this purpose.

**Final Answer: B: No**
