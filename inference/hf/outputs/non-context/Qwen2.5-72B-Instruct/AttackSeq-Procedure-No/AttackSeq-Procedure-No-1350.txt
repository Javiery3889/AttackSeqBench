### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the callCam app.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** The app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
     - **Collection Phase:** The app facilitates ARP cache poisoning.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** The app sends the collected data to the C&C (Command and Control) server using a customized encoding routine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks where the attacker gathers information about the target system. This aligns well with the callCam app collecting extensive information.
   - **Collection Phase:** ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic. While it is a valid technique, it is typically used for network manipulation and not directly for data collection. It is more commonly associated with the **Command and Control** or **Lateral Movement** phases.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** Sending data to a C&C server using a customized encoding routine is a common method for exfiltrating data. This aligns well with the described exfiltration phase.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not entirely plausible because ARP cache poisoning is not typically a technique used during the Collection phase. It is more likely to be used for network manipulation to facilitate other attacks.
   - The more plausible sequence would be:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Collect extensive information.
     - **Collection Phase:** Gather the specific data to be exfiltrated.
     - **Exfiltration Phase:** Send the data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine.

### Final Answer:
B: No
