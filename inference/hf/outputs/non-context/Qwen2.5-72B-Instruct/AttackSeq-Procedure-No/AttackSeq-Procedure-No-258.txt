### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Sednit group uses a spear-phishing email to deliver a Flash exploit ("flash_video_x86.swf") to establish a victim's machine as a valid target.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the group will make and impersonate tokens for privilege escalation to gain persistence on the victim's machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sednit Group (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy):** This group is known for sophisticated and multi-stage attacks. They often use a combination of initial access techniques, followed by privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms to maintain long-term access to victim networks.
   - **Initial Access:** The use of a spear-phishing email with a Flash exploit is a common initial access technique. This allows the attackers to gain a foothold on the victim's machine.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Once the initial access is established, it is common for advanced threat actors like Sednit to perform privilege escalation to gain higher-level access on the victim's machine. This can involve techniques such as token impersonation, which is a method to elevate privileges by impersonating the security context of a more privileged user.
   - **Persistence:** After gaining higher privileges, the attackers often establish persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access over time. This can include creating new accounts, modifying system configurations, or using other techniques to ensure they can return to the system even if the initial access point is closed.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing email with the Flash exploit is a known method used by Sednit to gain initial access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Given the sophistication of the Sednit group, it is highly likely that they will attempt to escalate privileges to gain more control over the victim's machine. Token impersonation is a common technique for this purpose.
   - **Persistence:** Once higher privileges are obtained, establishing persistence is a critical next step to ensure long-term access.
