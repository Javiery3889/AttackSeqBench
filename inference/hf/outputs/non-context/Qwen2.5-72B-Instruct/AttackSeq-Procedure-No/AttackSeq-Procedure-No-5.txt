### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where recipients are initially presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report.
   - It then asks if it is likely that these recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after they have already been infected with QuasarRAT.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Document Presentation:** The initial document simulating a legitimate blog post or report is likely a social engineering tactic to gain the trust of the recipients.
   - **Spear Phishing Emails:** These emails are a common method to deliver malware, often containing links to malicious documents.
   - **CVE-2017-8750 Exploit:** This is a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to deliver malware, such as QuasarRAT.
   - **QuasarRAT Delivery:** QuasarRAT is a remote access trojan that can be delivered via various methods, including exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8750.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the recipients are first presented with a document to gain their trust.
   - After gaining their trust, they are then targeted with spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
   - However, the question specifically asks if this sequence is likely to occur **only after** the recipients have already been infected with QuasarRAT.
   - If the recipients are already infected with QuasarRAT, there would be no need to send them additional spear phishing emails to deliver QuasarRAT again. The attacker would already have control over the compromised system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not likely to occur only after the recipients have already been infected with QuasarRAT. It is more plausible that the spear phishing emails containing the exploit would be sent to initially infect the recipients with QuasarRAT, not after they are already infected.

### Final Answer: B: No
