### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Running discovery commands to gather network configuration, user accounts, and remote systems.
     - Starting a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin.
     - Using webshells for lateral movement to other systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Commands:**
     - This is a common initial step in an attack to understand the environment. Techniques like `Network Service Scanning` (T1046), `Account Discovery` (T1087), and `System Network Configuration Discovery` (T1016) are typical.
   - **Starting a Remote VNC Session:**
     - VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop protocol. Downloading a new plugin to start a VNC session is a plausible step for gaining remote access. This could fall under `Remote Services` (T1021) and `Ingress Tool Transfer` (T1105).
   - **Using Webshells for Lateral Movement:**
     - Webshells are often used to maintain persistence and for lateral movement. This aligns with `Web Protocols` (T1095) and `Remote Services` (T1021).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Discovery:** The attacker gathers information about the network and systems.
     2. **Remote Access:** The attacker uses a VNC session to gain remote access, possibly by downloading a new plugin.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** The attacker uses webshells to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, the most plausible answer is that the actors did indeed start a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin before using webshells for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
