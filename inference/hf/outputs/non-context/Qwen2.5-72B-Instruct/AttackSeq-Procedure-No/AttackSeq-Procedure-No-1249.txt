### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor BlueBravo.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Defense evasion techniques: DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling.
     - Encrypted HTTPS communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
     - Gathering system information (username and computer name).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling are common techniques used to evade detection by security software. These techniques are typically used early in the attack to gain initial access and establish a foothold in the system.
   - **Encrypted HTTPS Communication:**
     - Once the malware has established a foothold, it often needs to communicate with a C2 server to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. Encrypted HTTPS communication is a common method to avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Gathering system information such as the username and computer name is a typical next step after establishing a connection with the C2 server. This information is often used to identify the compromised system and tailor further actions.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The logical sequence of events would be:
     1. **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses techniques like DLL side-loading and HTML smuggling to evade detection and gain initial access.
     2. **C2 Communication:** The malware establishes a secure connection with the C2 server using encrypted HTTPS communication.
     3. **System Information Gathering:** The malware gathers system information to identify the compromised system and plan further actions.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, it is likely that the malware will attempt encrypted HTTPS communication with its C2 server before gathering system information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
