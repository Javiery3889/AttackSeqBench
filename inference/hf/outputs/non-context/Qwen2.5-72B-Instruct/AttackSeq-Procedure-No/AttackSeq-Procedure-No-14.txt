### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Internal reconnaissance (accessing user’s contacts and extracting system and network information).
     - Lateral movement using pass the hash.
     - Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets leveraging the victim’s trusted relationships.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. APT42, like many advanced threat actors, would likely gather information about the network and user contacts to understand the environment better.
   - **Lateral Movement using Pass the Hash:**
     - Pass the hash is a technique where an attacker uses a stolen password hash to authenticate to other systems without needing the actual password. This is a common method for lateral movement within a network.
   - **Sending Spear-Phishing Emails:**
     - Spear-phishing is a targeted form of phishing where the attacker uses information gathered during reconnaissance to craft convincing emails to additional targets. This is often used to expand the attack footprint.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Reconnaissance → Lateral Movement → Spear-Phishing:**
     - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common attack patterns.
     - After gathering information (reconnaissance), the attacker would likely use that information to move laterally within the network (pass the hash).
     - Once the attacker has established a foothold in multiple systems, they might then use the compromised accounts to send spear-phishing emails to additional targets, leveraging the trusted relationships of the initial victim.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of TTPs that APT42 might use.

### Final Answer:
