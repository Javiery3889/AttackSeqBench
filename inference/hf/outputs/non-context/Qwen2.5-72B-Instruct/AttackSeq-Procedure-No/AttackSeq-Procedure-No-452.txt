### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group named APT-TOCS.
   - It mentions the use of specific TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for defense evasion: running in memory and multi-beacon communication.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT-TOCS will achieve content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies to redirect systems to download malware during the command and control (C2) tactic stage.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:**
     - **Running in Memory:** This technique involves executing malware in memory to avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions.
     - **Multi-Beacon Communication:** This involves using multiple communication channels to maintain persistence and evade detection.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Tactic:**
     - The C2 tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems.
   - **Content Injection:**
     - Content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies is a technique used to manipulate network traffic to redirect systems to malicious resources.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described involves using defense evasion techniques to maintain a low profile and then leveraging content injection to redirect systems to download malware during the C2 stage.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are effective techniques for evading detection and maintaining persistence.
   - **C2 and Content Injection:**
     - Once the APT group has established a foothold and evaded defenses, it is common for them to use C2 techniques to maintain control.
     - Content injection into DNS, HTTP, and SMB replies is a plausible next step to redirect systems to download additional malware, which is a common tactic in the C2 stage.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given the sophisticated nature of APT-TOCS and the described TTPs, it is highly likely that they would use content injection to achieve their objectives during the C2 stage.
