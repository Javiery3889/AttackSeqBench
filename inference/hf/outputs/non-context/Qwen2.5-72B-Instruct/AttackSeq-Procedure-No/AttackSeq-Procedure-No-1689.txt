### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker uses legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.
   - The attack is initiated by sending a PDF attachment that passes through security filters and appears benign.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that it is likely the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection after the initial PDF attachment was sent.
     - This aligns with the concept of "Living Off the Land" (LOTL) techniques, where attackers use legitimate system tools and scripts to blend in with normal system activity and avoid detection.
     - The initial PDF attachment passing through security filters and appearing benign is a common tactic to gain an initial foothold in the target environment.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection.
     - This does not align with the described attack sequence, as using legitimate tools and scripts is a common and effective method for evading detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to evade detection after the initial PDF attachment was sent.
   - Therefore, the final answer is: **A: Yes**.
