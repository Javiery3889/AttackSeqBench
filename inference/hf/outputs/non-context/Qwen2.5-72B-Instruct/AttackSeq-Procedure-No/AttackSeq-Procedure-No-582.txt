### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have performed credential dumping using a PowerShell script, likely related to Mimikatz, and have read the memory of lsass.exe.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks after these actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Dumping and Memory Reading:**
     - Credential dumping and reading the memory of lsass.exe are techniques used to extract credentials from a system. These actions are typically performed to gain access to additional systems or to escalate privileges.
   - **Anti-Sandboxing and Anti-Virtualization Checks:**
     - Anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks are techniques used by malware to detect if it is running in a controlled environment (e.g., a sandbox or virtual machine). These checks are often performed to avoid detection and analysis by security researchers or automated systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - After successfully performing credential dumping and reading the memory of lsass.exe, the attackers have already gained valuable information and potentially elevated their privileges.
     - At this point, the attackers are likely to focus on using the obtained credentials to move laterally within the network or to perform other post-exploitation activities.
     - Performing anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks is more relevant in the initial stages of an attack, when the malware is first deployed and needs to ensure it is not being analyzed.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context, it is less likely that the attackers will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks after they have already performed credential dumping and memory reading. These checks are more relevant in the early stages of an attack.

**Final Answer: B: No**
