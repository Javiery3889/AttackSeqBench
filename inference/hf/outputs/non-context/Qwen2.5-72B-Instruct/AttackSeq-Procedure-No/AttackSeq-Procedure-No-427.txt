### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) involving the use of Emotet to disseminate malware like Trickbot, QakBot, and ransomware such as Ryuk and Conti.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that attackers will encrypt data using ransomware families like Netwalker, REvil, Maze, DoppelPaymer, and RansomEXX before stealing sensitive data and demanding ransoms.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Malware Dissemination:**
     - Emotet is known for its role in initial access and disseminating other malware, including Trickbot and QakBot. These malware families are often used to establish a foothold in the network and to further spread other malicious payloads.
   - **Ransomware Deployment:**
     - Once the initial access is established, attackers often deploy ransomware to encrypt data and demand ransoms. Ryuk and Conti are examples of ransomware that can be deployed after initial access.
   - **Data Exfiltration and Ransom Demands:**
     - Many ransomware families, including Netwalker, REvil, Maze, DoppelPaymer, and RansomEXX, are known for not only encrypting data but also stealing sensitive data before encryption. This is a common tactic to increase the pressure on victims to pay the ransom.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The typical sequence of events in a ransomware attack often involves:
       1. Initial access (e.g., via Emotet).
       2. Deployment of additional malware (e.g., Trickbot, QakBot).
       3. Stealing sensitive data.
       4. Encrypting data.
       5. Demanding ransoms.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question suggests a sequence where data is encrypted using ransomware families like Netwalker, REvil, Maze, DoppelPaymer, and RansomEXX before stealing sensitive data and demanding ransoms.
   - However, the typical sequence involves stealing data before encryption to ensure that the attackers have leverage to demand ransoms.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. The more common and logical sequence is to steal data first, then encrypt it, and finally demand a ransom.
