### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads.
     2. Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory.
     3. The JavaScript downloader dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL.
     4. 'surprise.php' revealing its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Obfuscated VBA-Macro Functions**
     - This is a common technique used to evade detection and execute malicious code. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros are often used in Office documents to deliver payloads.
   - **Step 2: Decoding JavaScript Payloads**
     - The VBA macros decode JavaScript payloads, which are then executed. This is a typical method to deliver and execute malicious scripts.
   - **Step 3: Dropping a File into the Temporary Directory**
     - The decoded JavaScript payload drops a file into the system's temporary directory. This is a common technique to stage and execute further malicious activities.
   - **Step 4: Dropping 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL**
     - The JavaScript downloader then downloads a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL. This is a specific file name and suggests a particular payload or malware.
   - **Step 5: 'surprise.php' Revealing Visitor Tracking**
     - 'surprise.php' is a web page that reveals its source code, showing visitor tracking through an iframe. This suggests that the attack also involves web-based tracking or data exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. It follows a logical progression of TTPs:
     1. Initial infection vector (VBA macros).
     2. Decoding and execution of JavaScript payloads.
     3. Staging and execution of a malicious file.
     4. Web-based tracking or data exfiltration.
   - The specific file name 'nanagrams.exe' and the web page 'surprise.php' are consistent with a targeted and multi-stage attack.
