### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the DNSpionage attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Resource Development:** Generating Let's Encrypt certificates for redirected domains related to their fake websites.
     - **Targeted Surveillance:** Conducting surveillance against activists and bloggers.
     - **Exploitation:** Using password-protected macros in malicious Microsoft Office documents to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (Generating Let's Encrypt Certificates):**
     - This is a common technique used by attackers to make their fake websites appear more legitimate and to avoid detection by security systems.
   - **Targeted Surveillance:**
     - Conducting targeted surveillance is a logical next step after setting up the infrastructure (fake websites with valid certificates). It helps attackers gather intelligence on their targets, which can be used to craft more convincing and effective attacks.
   - **Exploitation (Using Password-Protected Macros):**
     - Using password-protected macros in malicious documents is a technique to evade detection by security software. This is often done after the initial reconnaissance and surveillance to ensure that the attack is more likely to succeed.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question (Resource Development → Targeted Surveillance → Exploitation) is logical and aligns with common attack patterns.
   - Attackers typically start by setting up the necessary infrastructure, then gather intelligence on their targets, and finally execute the attack using techniques that evade detection.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
