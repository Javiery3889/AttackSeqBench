### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The attack starts with a spear phishing campaign targeting officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from a specified IP address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing Campaign:**
     - Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers send personalized emails to specific individuals to trick them into clicking on malicious links or attachments.
   - **Use of Social Media Channels:**
     - Social media can be used to deliver malicious files, but it is less common in highly targeted spear phishing campaigns. Spear phishing typically relies on email to maintain a more direct and personalized approach.
   - **Downloading Crimson RAT:**
     - Once the initial compromise is achieved (e.g., through a malicious email attachment or link), the attacker may use the compromised system to download additional malware, such as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) like Crimson RAT, from a specified IP address.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Spear Phishing to Initial Compromise:**
     - The spear phishing campaign is the initial vector for gaining access to the victim's system. This is a common and effective method for targeted attacks.
   - **Use of Social Media:**
     - While social media can be used to spread malware, it is less likely to be the primary method in a highly targeted attack like this. The spear phishing email is more direct and personalized, making it more effective for targeting specific individuals.
   - **Downloading Crimson RAT:**
     - After the initial compromise, the attacker would likely use the compromised system to download additional malware, such as a RAT, to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The use of social media channels to deliver malicious files is less likely in a highly targeted spear phishing campaign. The attack is more likely to proceed directly from the spear phishing email to the download of the Crimson RAT.
