### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a payload is executed by enabling macros.
   - It then asks whether it is more likely that compromised VPN accounts will be used for persistence or that the path to the VBS script will be added to the task scheduler.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Execution of the payload by enabling macros.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The question asks about the method of persistenceâ€”either using compromised VPN accounts or adding the VBS script to the task scheduler.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Compromised VPN Accounts:**
     - Using compromised VPN accounts for persistence is a method where the attacker gains access to a legitimate user's credentials and uses them to maintain access to the network.
     - This method is less common for initial persistence because it requires the attacker to have already compromised a user's credentials, which is a more advanced and less immediate step.
   - **Adding VBS Script to Task Scheduler:**
     - Adding a VBS script to the task scheduler is a common and straightforward method for achieving persistence.
     - This method ensures that the script runs automatically at system startup or at regular intervals, maintaining the attacker's presence on the system.
     - It is a more immediate and reliable method for persistence, especially after the initial compromise.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the payload has already been executed by enabling macros, the attacker is likely to use a more immediate and reliable method for persistence.
   - Adding the VBS script to the task scheduler is a more common and effective method for ensuring that the attacker's presence is maintained on the system.

### Final Answer: B: No
