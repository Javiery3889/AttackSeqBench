### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Smooth Operator malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Automatically exfiltrating collected data via a second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.
     - Establishing communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers over HTTPS.
     - Using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP GET Request for Exfiltration:**
     - It is common for malware to use HTTP GET requests to exfiltrate data because it is a simple and often less suspicious method.
   - **Establishing Communication with C2 Servers over HTTPS:**
     - Using HTTPS for C2 communication is a common practice to encrypt the data and avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Custom Data Encoding Algorithm for Obfuscation:**
     - Malware often uses custom encoding or encryption algorithms to obfuscate data, making it harder for security systems to detect and analyze the traffic.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible because:
     - It follows a logical progression of actions that are commonly observed in sophisticated malware.
     - Using HTTPS for C2 communication and custom encoding for obfuscation are advanced techniques that enhance the malware's ability to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Final Answer:
