### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the QuasarRAT backdoor.
   - The backdoor achieves persistence by installing itself as a service named DILLJUICE.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the loader will utilize the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to execute commands via Windows DDE.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via Service Installation:**
     - Installing a backdoor as a service is a common technique for achieving persistence. This ensures that the backdoor runs automatically when the system starts.
   - **Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE):**
     - DDE is a protocol for inter-process communication in Windows. It is used to exchange data between applications.
     - DDE can be abused to execute commands, but it is not a common technique for loaders in the context of backdoors like QuasarRAT.
   - **QuasarRAT TTPs:**
     - QuasarRAT is known for its ability to perform various malicious activities, including persistence, command execution, and data exfiltration.
     - However, the use of DDE for command execution is not a typical or well-documented technique for QuasarRAT.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While DDE can be used for command execution, it is not a common or typical technique for QuasarRAT.
   - The persistence mechanism described (installing as a service) is more aligned with the known TTPs of QuasarRAT.
   - Therefore, it is less likely that the loader would utilize DDE for command execution.

### Final Answer: B: No
