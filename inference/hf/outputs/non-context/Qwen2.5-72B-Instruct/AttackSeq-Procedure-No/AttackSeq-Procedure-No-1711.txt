### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Black Energy 2 is likely to inject a DLL into the `svchost.exe` process to maintain persistence only after the botnet's command-and-control (C2) center communicates with the malware through HTTP requests.
   - Key elements to consider:
     - **Black Energy 2**: A known malware family.
     - **DLL Injection**: A technique where a malware injects a DLL into a legitimate process to execute its code.
     - **svchost.exe**: A legitimate Windows process often targeted by malware for persistence.
     - **Persistence**: The ability of malware to maintain a foothold on a system.
     - **C2 Communication**: The communication between the malware and the attacker's server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Injection for Persistence**: DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to maintain persistence. By injecting a DLL into a legitimate process like `svchost.exe`, the malware can run its code in the context of a trusted process, making it harder to detect and remove.
   - **C2 Communication**: Malware often communicates with a C2 server to receive commands, update its configuration, or exfiltrate data. However, the question specifically asks if the DLL injection happens **only** after C2 communication.
   - **Black Energy 2 Behavior**: Black Energy 2 is known to use various techniques for persistence and communication. It can inject DLLs into processes and communicate with C2 servers, but the sequence of these actions is not strictly defined as "only after C2 communication."

3. **Reasoning:**
   - While Black Energy 2 can inject DLLs into processes and communicate with C2 servers, the sequence described in the question (injecting a DLL into `svchost.exe` only after C2 communication) is not a typical or necessary sequence for the malware to achieve persistence.
   - Malware often performs persistence actions as early as possible to ensure it remains on the system, and C2 communication is typically a separate step that can occur at various points in the infection process.

### Final Answer:
B: No
