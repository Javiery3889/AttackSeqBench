### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where an attacker has installed a backdoor, exfiltrated data over a C&C (Command and Control) channel using encrypted communication, and then asks if it is likely that the backdoor will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - CaddyWiper is a known malware that has been used to wipe files and corrupt data, particularly in OT environments. It is designed to cause significant damage by wiping files and corrupting physical drive partitions.
     - After exfiltrating data, it is plausible that the attackers might want to cover their tracks and prevent the victim from recovering the data or the system. Deploying CaddyWiper to wipe files and partitions would align with this goal.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that it is not likely that the backdoor will deploy CaddyWiper. However, given the nature of CaddyWiper and the typical goals of advanced persistent threats (APTs), this seems less plausible.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (backdoor installation, data exfiltration, and then wiping files) is a common pattern in advanced cyber attacks. The use of CaddyWiper to wipe files and partitions is a logical next step to ensure that the data exfiltrated cannot be recovered and to cause maximum disruption.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor will indeed deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
