### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a script named 'stopedge.bat' manages the deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection before another script, 'versioninfo.bat', collects system details and information for exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **TTP 1:** 'stopedge.bat' deletes files to evade detection.
   - **TTP 2:** 'versioninfo.bat' collects system details and information for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - If 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before 'versioninfo.bat' runs, it would indeed help evade detection. However, this would also prevent 'versioninfo.bat' from collecting and exfiltrating the information, which is a key part of the attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If 'stopedge.bat' does not delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before 'versioninfo.bat' runs, it would allow 'versioninfo.bat' to collect and exfiltrate the information. This aligns better with the typical sequence of an attack where the attacker wants to gather and exfiltrate information before evading detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The goal of the attack is to collect and exfiltrate information. Deleting the files before they can run would defeat this purpose. Therefore, it is more plausible that 'stopedge.bat' would not delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before they have a chance to run and collect the necessary information.

### Final Answer: B: No
