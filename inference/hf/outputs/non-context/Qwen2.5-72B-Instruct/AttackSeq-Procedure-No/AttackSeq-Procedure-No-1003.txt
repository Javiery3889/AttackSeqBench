### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malware named Longhorn.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration.
     - Avoiding detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.
     - Configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target.
     - Using C&C (Command and Control) communication over HTTPS.
     - Using a custom cryptographic protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's malware does indeed configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Longhorn's malware does not configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Scheduled Exfiltration and Avoiding Detection:**
     - Malware often uses scheduled exfiltration and randomized intervals to avoid detection by network monitoring tools. This is a common TTP.
   - **Specific Domain and IP Address Configuration:**
     - Configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target is a sophisticated technique used to make it harder for defenders to block or detect the C&C communication. This is also a plausible TTP.
   - **C&C Communication over HTTPS:**
     - Using HTTPS for C&C communication is common to encrypt the traffic and avoid detection by network security tools.
   - **Custom Cryptographic Protocol:**
     - Using a custom cryptographic protocol adds an additional layer of security and makes it more difficult for defenders to decrypt and analyze the traffic. This is a sophisticated but plausible TTP.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the described TTPs and the common use of such techniques in advanced malware, it is plausible that Longhorn's malware would configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
