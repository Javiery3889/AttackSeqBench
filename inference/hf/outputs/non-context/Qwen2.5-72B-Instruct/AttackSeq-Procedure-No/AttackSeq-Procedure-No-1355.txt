### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SideWinder APT group.
   - The initial access was gained via CVE-2019-2215 through malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the group used techniques like obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection before using additional exploits (CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU) for privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The group used CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play. This is a known vulnerability in Android that allows for remote code execution.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation are common techniques used by APT groups to evade detection by security tools and analysts.
     - Obfuscation can make the code harder to understand and analyze.
     - Encryption can hide the payload and communication.
     - Dynamic code invocation can load and execute code at runtime, making it harder to detect and analyze statically.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - After gaining initial access, the group used additional exploits (CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU) to root devices and achieve privilege escalation.
     - CVE-2019-2215 can be used for both initial access and privilege escalation, depending on the context.
     - MediaTek-SU is a known exploit for rooting Android devices, which is a form of privilege escalation.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The use of CVE-2019-2215 to gain initial access via malicious apps on Google Play is a plausible and documented method.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - Given the sophistication of APT groups, it is highly likely that they would use obfuscation, encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection. These techniques are standard in the APT playbook to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Using additional exploits like CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU for privilege escalation is a logical next step after gaining initial access. Rooting the device provides the attackers with full control over the system.
