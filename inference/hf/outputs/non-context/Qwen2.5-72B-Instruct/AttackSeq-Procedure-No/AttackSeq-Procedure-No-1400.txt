### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting sensitive data from network shared drives.
     - Archiving the data locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.
     - Exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques (e.g., multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a command and control port) before exfiltrating the data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS Calculation Techniques:**
     - DNS Calculation techniques are typically used for obfuscation or to dynamically determine command and control (C2) server addresses or ports. This can help evade detection and make it harder for defenders to block or trace the C2 communication.
   - **Exfiltration Over Web Services:**
     - Exfiltration over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools is a common method for data exfiltration. These tools are often used to bypass network security measures and blend in with legitimate web traffic.
   - **Likelihood of Using DNS Calculation:**
     - While DNS Calculation techniques can be useful for C2 communication, they are not typically a prerequisite for exfiltration over web services. The primary focus in exfiltration is to ensure the data is transferred securely and undetected.
     - FIN13, like many advanced threat actors, may use a variety of techniques to achieve their goals, but the specific DNS Calculation technique mentioned is not a standard or necessary step in the exfiltration process over web services.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is not likely that FIN13 would use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

**Final Answer: B: No**
