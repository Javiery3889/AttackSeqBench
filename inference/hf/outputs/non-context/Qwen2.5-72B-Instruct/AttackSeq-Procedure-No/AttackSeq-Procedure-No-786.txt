### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using an LNK file to initiate multi-stage commands.
     - Executing a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase.
     - Configuring payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD to maintain persistence.
     - Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **LNK File and Multi-Stage Commands:**
     - LNK files (shortcuts) are often used to execute malicious payloads. They can be crafted to run scripts or executables when opened, making them a common initial access vector.
   - **Executing a JavaScript File:**
     - JavaScript files can be used to execute additional stages of the attack, such as downloading and running additional payloads or performing further actions on the system.
   - **Configuring Payloads to Load via LD_PRELOAD:**
     - LD_PRELOAD is a technique used in Linux environments to load a shared library before all others. It is not typically used in Windows environments, which is where LNK files and scheduled tasks are more common.
   - **Adding 'officeupdate.exe' to Scheduled Tasks:**
     - Adding a malicious executable to scheduled tasks is a common persistence technique in Windows environments. It ensures that the malware runs at regular intervals or at system startup.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of LD_PRELOAD is specific to Linux and is not a typical persistence mechanism in Windows environments.
   - The sequence described in the question involves Windows-specific techniques (LNK files, scheduled tasks).
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the JavaScript file would configure payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD in a Windows environment.

### Final Answer:
B: No
