### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of a specific sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence in question is:
     1. Lateral movement by exploiting remote services.
     2. Using internal spear phishing.
     3. Using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement by Exploiting Remote Services:**
     - This is a common technique used by threat actors to move from one system to another within a network. It often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in remote services such as RDP, SSH, or other network protocols.
   - **Using Internal Spear Phishing:**
     - Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where the attacker sends personalized emails to specific individuals within an organization to gain access to their credentials or to install malware.
     - This technique is typically used in the initial stages of an attack to gain a foothold in the network.
   - **Using Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan:**
     - These tools are used for network reconnaissance to discover and map out the network topology, identify open ports, and gather information about the systems in the network.
     - Network reconnaissance is usually performed after gaining initial access to the network to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most logical or common sequence of TTPs.
   - Typically, an attacker would:
     1. **Initial Access:** Use spear phishing to gain initial access to the network.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover and map the network.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Exploit remote services to move laterally within the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence provided in the question (lateral movement, then internal spear phishing, then network reconnaissance) is not a typical or logical sequence of TTPs. It is more likely that the attacker would use spear phishing to gain initial access, then perform reconnaissance, and finally engage in lateral movement.

### Final Answer: B: No
