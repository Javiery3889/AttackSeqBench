### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using HTTP protocol to communicate with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
     - Sending localization data and keyboard layout information to the C2 server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox as part of its exfiltration process.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP Communication with C2 Server:**
     - This is a common TTP for malware to establish and maintain communication with its C2 server. It allows the malware to receive commands and send data back to the attacker.
   - **Sending Localization Data and Keyboard Layout Information:**
     - This information can be used by the attacker to tailor further attacks or to understand the environment of the compromised system.
   - **Exfiltration to Dropbox:**
     - While exfiltration is a common TTP, the use of Dropbox specifically is not a typical method for BlackEnergy 3 malware. BlackEnergy 3 is known for using more direct methods for exfiltration, such as HTTP, FTP, or custom protocols.
     - Dropbox is a cloud storage service and is not a common exfiltration method for advanced malware like BlackEnergy 3, which typically uses more stealthy and direct methods to avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of BlackEnergy 3 malware and the common exfiltration methods used by such malware, it is not likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox.

**Final Answer: B: No**
