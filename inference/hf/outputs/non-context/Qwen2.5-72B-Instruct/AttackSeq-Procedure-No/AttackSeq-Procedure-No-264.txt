### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Mustang Panda group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering a downloader with filenames linked to current events.
     - Opening a decoy document to gain initial access.
     - Deploying a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax.
     - Engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Mustang Panda is known to use social engineering and phishing techniques to deliver downloaders with filenames linked to current events. This is a common initial access technique.
     - Opening a decoy document to gain initial access is also a typical method used by this group to trick victims into executing malicious payloads.

   - **UEFI Rootkit (LoJax):**
     - LoJax is a UEFI rootkit that has been associated with the Sednit (also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear) group, not Mustang Panda. While Mustang Panda is a sophisticated group, they are not known to use UEFI rootkits like LoJax.
     - Deploying a UEFI rootkit is a highly advanced and rare technique, typically used for long-term persistence and is more commonly associated with state-sponsored actors.

   - **Control-Flow Obfuscation:**
     - Control-flow obfuscation is a technique used to evade detection by making the code harder to analyze. This is a common defense evasion technique used by many advanced threat actors, including Mustang Panda.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While Mustang Panda is known for sophisticated TTPs, the use of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax is not typical for this group. The sequence described in the question includes a step that is not characteristic of Mustang Panda's known TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Mustang Panda would deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation.

### Final Answer: B: No
