### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an actor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Utilizing obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads.
     - Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from a command and control (C2) server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscated VBA-Macro Functions:**
     - VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macros are commonly used in phishing attacks to execute malicious code.
     - Obfuscation is used to hide the true nature of the code, making it harder for security tools to detect.
   - **Decoding JavaScript Payloads:**
     - JavaScript is often used in malware to perform various malicious activities, such as downloading additional payloads or executing commands.
   - **Dropping a File into the Temporary Directory:**
     - Malware often drops files into temporary directories to avoid detection and to execute further stages of the attack.
   - **Retrieving Encrypted Commands from a C2 Server:**
     - Once the initial payload is executed, malware often communicates with a C2 server to receive further instructions.
     - These commands can be encrypted to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
   - **Follow-on Actions (e.g., Cryptocurrency Mining):**
     - After establishing a foothold, the malware may perform various malicious activities, including cryptocurrency mining, which is a common follow-on action for many types of malware.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a typical attack pattern:
     - Initial infection via obfuscated VBA macros.
     - Decoding and executing additional payloads.
     - Dropping files to establish persistence.
     - Communicating with a C2 server for further instructions.
     - Performing follow-on actions like cryptocurrency mining.
   - Given this sequence, it is highly likely that the actor will retrieve encrypted commands from the C2 server to continue the attack and perform additional malicious activities.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
