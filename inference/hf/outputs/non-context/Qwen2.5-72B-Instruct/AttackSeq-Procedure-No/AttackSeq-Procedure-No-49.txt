### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence through the deployment of ThreatNeedle installer-type malware.
     - Registering loader-type malware for auto-execution.
     - Conducting discovery activities such as process discovery.
     - Using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Auto-Execution:**
     - The deployment of ThreatNeedle installer-type malware and registering loader-type malware for auto-execution are typical initial steps in establishing a foothold and ensuring the malware remains active even after system reboots.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Discovery activities, such as process discovery, are often conducted early in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC typically follows discovery activities. This is because the attacker needs to gather information about the network and systems to determine the best paths for movement.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that discovery activities (process discovery) would likely occur before lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - It is more logical for the attacker to first understand the environment (discovery) before attempting to move laterally to other systems.
   - Therefore, the statement that discovery activities are conducted only after lateral movement is not accurate.

### Final Answer:
B: No
