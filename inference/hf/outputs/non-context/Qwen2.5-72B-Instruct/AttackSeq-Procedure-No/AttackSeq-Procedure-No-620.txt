### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the lightSpy malware performing data collection on various types of data, including hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware uses a specific method (DNS Calculation) to determine the command and control (C2) port for module updates and data exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Collection:** The data collection activities described (hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data) are common in many malware operations. These activities are typically part of the "Data Collection" phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **DNS Calculation:** The method described for determining the C2 port involves a specific calculation using the octets of an IP address. This is a more specific and less common technique. It is not a standard or widely known method for determining C2 ports.
   - **Plausibility:** While malware can use various methods to determine C2 ports, the specific method described (multiplying the first two octets and adding the third octet) is not a common or well-documented technique. More common methods include hardcoding the port, using domain generation algorithms (DGAs), or dynamically determining the port based on other factors.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection Phase:** The data collection activities are plausible and align with known malware behaviors.
   - **C2 Port Determination:** The specific DNS Calculation method is not a standard or widely used technique. It is more likely that the malware would use a simpler or more established method to determine the C2 port.
   - **Conclusion:** Given the lack of evidence or commonality for the specific DNS Calculation method, it is less likely that lightSpy would use this method.

### Final Answer
