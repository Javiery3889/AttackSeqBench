### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence in question is: 
     1. Initial Access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
     2. Execution of the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.
     3. Discovery activities, such as system network connections discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common method for initial access. The Lazarus group is known to use spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, such as Word documents, to gain initial access to a victim's network.
   - **Execution:**
     - Once the malicious Word document is opened, it can execute a payload, such as the ThreatNeedle backdoor. Running the backdoor in memory is a common technique to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - After gaining execution, the next logical step is to perform discovery activities to understand the network environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation. System network connections discovery is a typical discovery activity.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and logical sequence of TTPs:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with a malicious Word document.
     2. **Execution:** Running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.
     3. **Discovery:** System network connections discovery.
   - This sequence aligns with the known tactics and techniques used by the Lazarus group.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
