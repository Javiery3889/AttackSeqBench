### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access via spear-phishing emails containing trojanized installation executables.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would collect victim employee name information before engaging in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Spear-Phishing:**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails to victims, often with malicious attachments or links.
     - The use of trojanized installation executables is a typical payload for such attacks.
   - **Collection of Victim Employee Name Information:**
     - Collecting victim employee name information is not a standard early-stage activity for most malware. Typically, malware focuses on establishing a foothold and then moving to more critical discovery and data collection activities.
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Discovery activities, such as gathering system information and network views, are crucial for the attacker to understand the environment and plan further actions.
     - These activities are usually performed immediately after gaining initial access to assess the target's network and system configurations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Timing and Priority:**
     - After gaining initial access, the primary goal of malware is to establish a stable presence and gather information about the environment.
     - Collecting victim employee name information is a more specific and less immediate task compared to the broader discovery activities.
   - **Common Malware Behavior:**
     - Malware like TDrop2 is designed to be efficient and effective in its initial stages. It is more likely to focus on system and network discovery to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Practical Considerations:**
     - Collecting employee names might be useful for social engineering or further targeted attacks, but it is not a typical first step in the initial stages of an attack.
