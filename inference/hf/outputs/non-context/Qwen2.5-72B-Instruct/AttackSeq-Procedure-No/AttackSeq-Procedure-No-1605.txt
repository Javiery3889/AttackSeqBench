### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the deployment of njRAT malware for credential harvesting and the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases by SideCopy.
   - The sequence involves gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gaining access through malicious LNK files.
   - **Delivery:** Delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
   - **Execution:** Deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases by SideCopy.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases only after the initial access through malicious LNK files and the delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
     - This aligns with the described sequence of TTPs.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that SideCopy does not exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases only after the initial access through malicious LNK files and the delivery of payloads via a convoluted infection chain.
     - This does not align with the described sequence of TTPs.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question is logical and follows a typical attack pattern:
     - **Initial Access:** Malicious LNK files are used to gain initial access.
     - **Delivery:** A convoluted infection chain is used to deliver the payload.
     - **Execution:** njRAT malware is deployed for credential harvesting.
     - **Exfiltration:** SideCopy exfiltrates the harvested Kavach authentication databases.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
