### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
     - Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.
     - Performing reconnaissance and gathering output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB:**
     - This is a common technique for initial access and lateral movement, often used to gain a foothold in the network and move laterally.
   - **Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader:**
     - This is a technique used to maintain persistence and enable further lateral movement by compromising additional servers.
   - **Performing reconnaissance and gathering output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit:**
     - SharpHound is a tool used for Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance, which helps in mapping the network and identifying potential targets.
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for various post-exploitation tasks, including reconnaissance and data exfiltration.
     - These tools are often used during the Discovery phase to gather information about the network and identify valuable targets.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     - **Initial Access and Lateral Movement:**
       - Accessing shared folders and dropping a web shell loader are typical steps for gaining initial access and moving laterally within a network.
     - **Discovery:**
       - Using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance is a natural next step after gaining access and establishing a foothold. These tools help the attacker understand the network topology and identify valuable targets for further exploitation.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
