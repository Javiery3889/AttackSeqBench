### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 to execute a first stage downloader.
   - The first stage downloader retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
   - The PlugX file successfully connects to several C2 domains, including cdn[.]sanecat[.]com.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will use steganography to hide its C2 communications with domains such as inocnation[.]com or oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2015-5119:** This is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that has been exploited in various campaigns to deliver malware.
   - **PlugX:** This is a sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that has been used in targeted attacks, often for espionage purposes. It is known for its ability to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Sakula:** This is another piece of malware, often associated with the Lazarus Group, which has been used in various cyber-attacks. Sakula is known for its modular architecture and can use various techniques to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Steganography:** This is a technique used to hide data within other data, often used to evade detection by blending in with normal network traffic.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The initial exploitation and the use of PlugX suggest a sophisticated and multi-stage attack.
   - PlugX is known for its robust C2 communication capabilities, but it does not typically use steganography.
   - Sakula, on the other hand, is known for its modular nature and can use various techniques, including steganography, to communicate with C2 servers.
   - However, the question specifically mentions that the PlugX file has already established C2 communications with domains like cdn[.]sanecat[.]com. This suggests that the initial C2 communication is already established and functioning.
   - Given that the initial C2 communication is already in place, it is less likely that Sakula would need to use steganography to hide its C2 communications, especially if the existing C2 infrastructure is sufficient.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
