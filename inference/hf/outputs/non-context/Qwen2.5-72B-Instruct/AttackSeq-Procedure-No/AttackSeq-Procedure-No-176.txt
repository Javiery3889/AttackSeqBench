### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an adversary named Whitefly.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
     - Achieving lateral movement.
     - Using malware to repeatedly check the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system.
     - Using tools to steal large volumes of sensitive information for collection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Leveraging Stolen Credentials and Lateral Movement:**
     - This is a common TTP in cyber attacks. Adversaries often use stolen credentials to move laterally within a network to gain access to additional systems.
   - **Using Malware to Check Mouse Cursor Position:**
     - This technique is typically used to detect if a system is being actively used by a human. It is a form of anti-forensic or anti-detection technique to avoid being noticed by the user or security systems.
   - **Stealing Large Volumes of Sensitive Information:**
     - Once the adversary has confirmed that the system is not being actively monitored, they may proceed to exfiltrate sensitive data.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible because:
     - It follows a logical progression of TTPs.
     - Checking the mouse cursor position is a known technique to ensure that the system is not being actively used, which can help the adversary avoid detection.
     - Stealing large volumes of sensitive information is a common goal after gaining access and ensuring the system is not being monitored.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
