### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a backdoor configuration that includes an encryption/decryption key and an XOR-encrypted C&C server address.
   - It asks whether API hooking techniques are likely to be used to evade detection by modifying the functions `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` in memory.

2. **Evaluate the TTPs:**
   - **Encryption/Decryption Key and XOR-encrypted C&C Server Address:**
     - These techniques are commonly used to obfuscate the C&C server address and communication, making it harder for defenders to identify and block the communication.
   - **API Hooking:**
     - API hooking is a technique where an attacker modifies the behavior of specific functions in memory to evade detection or to manipulate the system in some way.
     - `ZwOpenProcess` is a Windows API function used to open a handle to a process, which can be hooked to hide processes or to manipulate process-related operations.
     - `GetExtendedTcpTable` is a function used to retrieve information about TCP connections, which can be hooked to hide network activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Choice A: Yes**
     - Given that the backdoor already uses encryption and obfuscation techniques, it is plausible that the attackers would also use API hooking to further evade detection. Hooking `ZwOpenProcess` and `GetExtendedTcpTable` would help in hiding the backdoor's processes and network activity, making it more difficult for security tools to detect the malicious activity.
   - **Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that API hooking is not likely to be used. However, given the sophisticated nature of the backdoor (using encryption and XOR), it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would employ additional evasion techniques like API hooking.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of encryption and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses indicates a sophisticated backdoor. Such backdoors often employ multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - API hooking is a common technique used in advanced malware to hide processes and network activity, which aligns with the sophisticated nature of the backdoor described.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
