### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by CozyDuke, a known malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`.
     - Establishing persistence.
     - Disabling MFA for a specified user using the `AADInternals Set-AADIntUserMFA` command.
     - Communicating with the C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution by a dropper using `rundll32.exe`:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to execute malicious code. `rundll32.exe` is often used to load and execute DLLs, which can be a way to evade detection.
   - **Establishing persistence:**
     - Malware often establishes persistence to ensure it can run again after a system reboot. This can be done through various methods such as registry keys, scheduled tasks, or startup folders.
   - **Disabling MFA for a specified user using the `AADInternals Set-AADIntUserMFA` command:**
     - Disabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a sophisticated and targeted action. It is typically performed to gain deeper access to a network or specific user accounts. However, this action is not a common initial step in a typical malware infection sequence. It is more likely to be part of a post-compromise activity where the attacker has already gained significant access and is looking to maintain or expand their control.
   - **Communicating with the C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter:**
     - Communication with a C&C server is a common action for malware to receive further instructions, exfiltrate data, or maintain control over the infected system. This is typically done after the initial infection and persistence establishment.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible up to the point of establishing persistence.
   - Disabling MFA using the `AADInternals Set-AADIntUserMFA` command is a highly targeted and advanced action that is more likely to occur after the initial infection and persistence have been established, and the attacker has gained deeper access to the system.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that CozyDuke would disable MFA for a specified user immediately after establishing persistence and before communicating with the C&C server.

### Final Answer
