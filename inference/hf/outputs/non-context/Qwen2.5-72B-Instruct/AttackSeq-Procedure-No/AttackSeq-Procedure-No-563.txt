### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls**: This technique involves subverting trust controls to evade defenses.
     2. **T1071 Application Layer Protocol**: This technique involves using application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for command and control (C2) communication.
     3. **T1057 Process Discovery**: This technique involves gathering information about running processes on a system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls**: This is typically used to gain initial access or to maintain persistence by subverting security controls. It is a foundational step that allows the attacker to operate undetected.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol**: This is used for establishing command and control (C2) communication. Once the attacker has subverted trust controls, they need a way to communicate with the compromised system to issue commands and receive data.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery**: This is used to gather information about the system, such as running processes, which can help the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Analysis**:
     - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls**: This is the first step, as it allows the attacker to evade defenses and gain a foothold in the system.
     - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol**: This is the next logical step, as the attacker needs to establish C2 communication to control the compromised system.
     - **T1057 Process Discovery**: This is a subsequent step, as the attacker would use this technique to gather information about the system and internal network after establishing C2 communication.

   - **Plausibility**:
     - The sequence described in the question (T1553 -> T1071 -> T1057) is plausible because it follows a logical progression of an attack:
       1. **Subvert Trust Controls** to gain initial access and evade detection.
       2. **Establish C2 Communication** to control the compromised system.
       3. **Discover Processes** to understand the environment and identify further targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
