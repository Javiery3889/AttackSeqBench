### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor TA505.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.
     2. Gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
     3. Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon on the compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion:**
     - This is a common technique used to evade detection by security tools. Base64 encoding is often used to obfuscate the payload.
   - **Gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211):**
     - This is a specific vulnerability that could be used to gain initial access to a system. However, it is important to verify if this is a known method used by TA505.
   - **Executing Cobalt Strike Beacon on the compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands:**
     - Cobalt Strike Beacon is a popular post-exploitation tool used by many threat actors, including TA505. Using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands is a common method to execute it while evading detection.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **TA505 and FlawedGrace RAT:**
     - TA505 is known to use the FlawedGrace RAT, and storing it as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion is a plausible step.
   - **Exploiting CVE-2021-35211:**
     - While TA505 has been known to use various vulnerabilities to gain initial access, there is no specific public report linking TA505 directly to the exploitation of CVE-2021-35211. However, threat actors often adapt to new vulnerabilities, so it is not entirely implausible.
   - **Using Cobalt Strike Beacon:**
     - TA505 has been known to use Cobalt Strike Beacon in their operations, and using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to execute it is a common technique.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is technically plausible. However, the specific use of CVE-2021-35211 by TA505 is not well-documented in public reports. Therefore, while the sequence is possible, it is not definitively known to be a common or verified method used by TA505.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
