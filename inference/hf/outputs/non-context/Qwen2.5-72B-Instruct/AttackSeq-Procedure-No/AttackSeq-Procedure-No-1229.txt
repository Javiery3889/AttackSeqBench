### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus group, specifically:
     - Deployment of Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
     - Leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories.
     - Establishing command and control (C&C) communication using backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deployment of Hermes Ransomware:**
     - Hermes ransomware is known for its encryption capabilities and is often used by the Lazarus group to extort victims.
   - **Leaving Ransom Notes:**
     - Ransom notes are a common tactic used by ransomware operators to inform victims of the encryption and provide instructions for payment.
   - **Establishing C&C Communication:**
     - Backdoor malware is often used to maintain persistent access to compromised systems and to receive further commands from the attackers.
     - The use of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands is a typical behavior in advanced persistent threat (APT) operations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is consistent with the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the Lazarus group.
   - The deployment of ransomware and the establishment of C&C communication are often part of a multi-stage attack where the initial compromise is followed by the deployment of additional malware to maintain control and execute further actions.
   - The use of backdoor malware to poll C&C servers is a common method for attackers to maintain control over compromised systems and to receive further instructions.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
