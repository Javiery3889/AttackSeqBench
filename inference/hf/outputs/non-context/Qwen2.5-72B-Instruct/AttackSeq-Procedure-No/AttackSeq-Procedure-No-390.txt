### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors use AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate programs.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use a VBA script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **AtomBombing:**
     - AtomBombing is a code injection technique that leverages the Windows atom table to inject code into a process. It is typically used to execute arbitrary code in the context of a legitimate process, often to evade detection.
   - **VBA Script in a Word Document:**
     - VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripts are commonly used in malicious documents to execute code when the document is opened. This is a common initial infection vector used by threat actors to gain a foothold in a system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Infection Vector:**
     - VBA scripts in Word documents are often used as an initial infection vector to deliver and execute malware. This is a common technique to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Post-Exploitation:**
     - Once initial access is gained, threat actors may use more sophisticated techniques like AtomBombing to maintain persistence, evade detection, and execute additional payloads.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the threat actors have already gained initial access and are using AtomBombing for code injection. This implies that the initial infection vector (like a VBA script in a Word document) has already been used.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that the threat actors are already using AtomBombing, it is less likely that they would need to use a VBA script in a Word document as part of their current strategy, as they have already achieved initial access and are focusing on more advanced techniques.

### Final Answer: B: No
