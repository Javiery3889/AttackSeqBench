### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Smoaler malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Overwriting the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file to evade detection.
     2. Executing the embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.
     3. Establishing persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Overwriting the Infected RTF File:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection by security software. By overwriting the original file with a decoy, the malware can hide its presence.
   - **Executing the Embedded Payload:**
     - Writing the payload to the %TEMP% folder and running it is a typical method for malware to execute its code. The %TEMP% folder is often used because it is a common location for temporary files and is less likely to be monitored closely.
   - **Establishing Persistence:**
     - Using rundll32.exe to establish persistence is a known technique. Rundll32.exe is a legitimate Windows utility that can be abused to load malicious DLLs or execute other commands. This is often done to ensure the malware runs automatically upon system reboot or user logon.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common pattern for malware:
     1. **Evasion:** Overwrite the infected file to avoid detection.
     2. **Execution:** Write and run the payload to perform the malicious actions.
     3. **Persistence:** Ensure the malware remains active by setting up a mechanism for automatic re-loading.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question is plausible and aligns with known TTPs of malware like Smoaler.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Smoaler would establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading only after executing its embedded payload.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
