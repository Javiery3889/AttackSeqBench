### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving APT28 (a well-known threat actor group).
   - The sequence starts with spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process before executing a dropper to enable system compromise.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 is known to use spear phishing with malicious attachments to gain initial access to target systems. This is a common TTP for APT28 and aligns with the first part of the sequence.
   - **Discovery Process:**
     - During the discovery process, APT28 typically aims to understand the network topology, identify valuable assets, and gather information about the environment. This often involves using tools and techniques to map the network and identify key systems.
   - **Geographically Distributed Bots:**
     - Using geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server is not a typical TTP for APT28 during the discovery process. APT28 usually focuses on maintaining a low profile and using more direct and controlled communication channels to avoid detection.
   - **Executing a Dropper:**
     - After the discovery process, APT28 may use a dropper to deploy additional malware or tools to further compromise the system. This is a common step in their attack lifecycle.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The use of geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process is not a typical or necessary step for APT28. They are more likely to use more direct and controlled methods to maintain stealth and control over their operations.

### Final Answer: B: No
