### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Konni APT Group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by scheduling the 'install.vbs' script to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'.
     - Gaining initial access by delivering an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL.
     - Executing scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' via various VBScripts and batch files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat':**
     - This is a common technique used by APT groups to ensure that their malware remains active on the target system even after reboots.
     - Scheduling a script to run at regular intervals (every 33 minutes) is a typical persistence mechanism.
   - **Initial Access via ISO File:**
     - Initial access typically involves the first point of entry into the target system. This can be through various means such as phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
     - Delivering an ISO file from an in-the-wild URL is a plausible method for initial access, especially if the ISO file contains malicious content.
   - **Execution of 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat':**
     - The execution of these scripts via VBScripts and batch files suggests a multi-step process where the initial access leads to the execution of additional scripts to achieve further objectives.
     - 'resolve.dns' could be used for DNS resolution to communicate with command and control (C2) servers, and 'stopedge.bat' could be part of the persistence mechanism or a step in the attack chain.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with the typical attack flow of an APT group:
     1. **Initial Access:** The ISO file is downloaded and executed, providing the initial foothold.
     2. **Execution of Scripts:** The ISO file likely contains or downloads additional scripts ('resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat') to perform further actions.
     3. **Persistence:** The 'install.vbs' script is scheduled to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat' to ensure the malware remains active.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the typical behavior of APT groups, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
