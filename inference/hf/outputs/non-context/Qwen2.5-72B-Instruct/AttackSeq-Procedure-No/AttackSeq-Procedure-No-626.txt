### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The campaign has already established communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Established Communication:**
     - The campaign has already established communication with C2 servers using DNS and HTTP tunneling. This indicates that the attackers have a preferred and established method for maintaining control and communication with the compromised system.
   - **Exfiltration Protocols:**
     - The question asks about exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
     - **HTTPS:** This is a common protocol for secure web communication and is often used for exfiltration because it can blend in with normal web traffic.
     - **SMTPS:** This is a secure version of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, used for sending emails. It is less common for exfiltration compared to HTTPS but can still be used.
   - **Non-C2 Protocol:**
     - The term "non-C2 protocol" suggests that the exfiltration would not use the same channels (DNS and HTTP) that are already established for C2 communication.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given that the attackers have already established a reliable C2 channel using DNS and HTTP, it is less likely that they would switch to a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration. Using the same protocols (DNS and HTTP) for both C2 and exfiltration is more efficient and reduces the risk of detection.
     - However, using HTTPS for exfiltration is still a plausible scenario because it is a common and secure protocol that can blend in with normal traffic, making it harder to detect.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the established communication methods and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is less likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. The attackers are more likely to use the same protocols (DNS and HTTP) for both C2 and exfiltration to maintain efficiency and reduce the risk of detection.

**Final Answer: B: No**
