### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Achieving persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'
     - Collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     - Searching for files and targeting non-English filenames as part of discovery operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task and installing a service (like the 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service') is a common technique for achieving persistence. This ensures that the malware runs every time the system starts or at regular intervals.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer is a typical method for collecting sensitive information from the victim's system. These tools capture keystrokes, take screenshots, and steal clipboard data, which can provide valuable information to the attacker.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Searching for files and targeting non-English filenames is a specific discovery operation. This could be part of a broader data collection effort, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite to using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Operations:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the discovery operation (searching for files and targeting non-English filenames) happens only after the data collection (using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer).
     - However, in typical attack scenarios, discovery operations often occur early in the attack lifecycle to identify valuable targets and plan further actions. Data collection tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers are often used concurrently with or after discovery to gather specific information.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - While it is possible for an attacker to perform discovery operations after data collection, it is less common and less efficient. Discovery operations are usually performed to identify what data to collect, making it more likely that they would occur before or concurrently with data collection.
