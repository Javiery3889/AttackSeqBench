### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Lateral movement using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).
     - Bypassing network segmentation using compromised routers.
     - Conducting discovery activities such as file and directory discovery.
     - Utilizing the Responder tool to harvest credentials during the credential access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement and Network Segmentation Bypass:**
     - Lateral movement using WMIC is a common technique for moving between systems within a network.
     - Compromising routers to bypass network segmentation is a sophisticated method to gain access to different network segments.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The Responder tool is often used to capture network credentials by responding to NetBIOS name service (NBT-NS) and Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) requests.
     - This tool is typically used during the credential access phase to gather credentials that can be used for further lateral movement or other activities.
   - **Discovery:**
     - File and directory discovery is a common activity during the discovery phase, where the attacker explores the network to find valuable data and understand the environment.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question asks if the discovery activities (file and directory discovery) will only occur after the credential access phase using the Responder tool.
   - In a typical attack sequence, the discovery phase often follows the initial access and credential access phases. However, the exact order can vary depending on the attacker's strategy and the specific environment.
   - It is plausible that the Lazarus group might conduct discovery activities after gaining additional credentials using the Responder tool, but it is not strictly necessary for discovery to occur only after credential access.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While it is common for discovery activities to follow credential access, it is not a strict requirement. The Lazarus group might conduct discovery activities at various points in the attack sequence, including before or after credential access.

### Final Answer:
B: No
