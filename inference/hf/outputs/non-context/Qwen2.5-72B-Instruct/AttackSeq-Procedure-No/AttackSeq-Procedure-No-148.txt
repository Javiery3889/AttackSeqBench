### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
     - Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that TG1021 established command and control (C2) using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Accessing Shared Folders and Dropping Web Shell:**
     - Accessing shared folders over SMB and dropping a web shell loader are common techniques for initial access and lateral movement. This aligns with the initial stages of an attack.
   - **Establishing Command and Control:**
     - Command and control (C2) is a critical phase in an attack where the attacker maintains communication with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data.
     - One-way communication methods are less common for C2 because they do not allow for interactive control. However, they can be used for data exfiltration or to send commands in a stealthy manner.
   - **GitLab and Digital Point:**
     - GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that can be used for code hosting and collaboration. It has been used in some attacks for C2, often by embedding commands or data in repositories or issues.
     - Digital Point is less commonly known in the context of C2, but it could refer to a specific platform or service used for communication.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - While one-way communication methods can be used for C2, they are less common and less effective for maintaining persistent control over a compromised system.
   - GitLab has been used in some sophisticated attacks for C2, but the combination of GitLab and Digital Point for one-way communication is not a well-documented or common TTP.
   - Given the context and the typical TTPs used by advanced threat groups, it is less likely that TG1021 would use a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point for C2.

### Final Answer:
B: No
