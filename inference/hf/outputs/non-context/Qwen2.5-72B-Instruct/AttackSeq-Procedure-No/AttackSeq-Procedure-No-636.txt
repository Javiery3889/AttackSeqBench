### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page that exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers loaded a plist file using the `launchctl` command before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

2. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the attackers used the `launchctl` command to load a plist file before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the attackers did not use the `launchctl` command to load a plist file before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Context of the Attack:**
     - The attack involves inserting malicious JavaScript into a news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page. This is a common web-based attack vector.
   - **Use of `launchctl` and Plist Files:**
     - The `launchctl` command is used on macOS to load and manage daemons and agents defined in plist files. These are typically used for persistence and background tasks.
     - Loading a plist file using `launchctl` is more relevant in the context of maintaining persistence on a victim's machine after initial compromise, rather than in the initial stages of a web-based attack.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence described in the question focuses on the initial stages of the attack: inserting malicious JavaScript and redirecting victims to an exploit landing page.
     - The use of `launchctl` and plist files is not typically part of the initial web-based attack vector but rather a subsequent step to maintain persistence or execute additional payloads.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the context and the typical sequence of events in a web-based attack, it is unlikely that the attackers would have used the `launchctl` command to load a plist file before inserting the malicious JavaScript code.

### Final Answer: B: No
