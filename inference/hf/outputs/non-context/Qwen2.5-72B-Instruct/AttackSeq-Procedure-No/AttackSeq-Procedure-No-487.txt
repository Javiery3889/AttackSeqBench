### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
     2. **Execution:** Using `cmd.exe` to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
     3. **Resource Development:** Acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities is a common initial access technique. This aligns with the known TTPs of many threat actors, including FamousSparrow.
   - **Execution:** Using `cmd.exe` to download and install a backdoor is a plausible next step after gaining initial access. This is a common technique to establish persistence and maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Resource Development:** Acquiring infrastructure is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle. It is often done to support further operations, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or setting up command and control (C2) infrastructure.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain access to the target system.
     2. **Execution:** Install a backdoor to maintain access.
     3. **Resource Development:** Acquire additional infrastructure to support further operations.
   - This sequence is consistent with the typical attack lifecycle and the known TTPs of threat actors like FamousSparrow.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
