### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts.
     2. Exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
     3. Abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.
     4. Achieving the ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that attackers will abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts only after achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that attackers will not wait to achieve their ultimate objective before abusing command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Scanning:**
     - Deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts and exploiting exposed Docker API ports are initial steps to gain access to the target environment.
   - **Command Interpreter Abuse:**
     - Once initial access is gained, attackers often use command interpreters to execute various malicious activities, including cryptocurrency mining, to quickly leverage the compromised resources.
   - **Resource Hijacking:**
     - The ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images is a more sophisticated and long-term goal. It involves deploying and maintaining malicious containers to continuously use the victim's resources.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - It is more plausible that attackers will start mining cryptocurrency as soon as they gain access to the system to maximize their immediate gains. They do not typically wait to achieve their ultimate objective before engaging in such activities.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
