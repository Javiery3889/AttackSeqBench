### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the OceanLotus Group using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for command-and-control (C2) communication before performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows built-in tools.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for C2 Communication:**
     - DoH is a method of encrypting DNS queries and responses, which can be used to evade detection and censorship.
   - **Lateral Movement using Stolen Credentials:**
     - This involves moving from one system to another within a network using credentials obtained from a compromised system.
   - **Leveraging Windows Built-in Tools:**
     - This typically involves using legitimate Windows tools (e.g., PowerShell, psexec) to perform actions that can be used for malicious purposes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **OceanLotus Group (APT32):**
     - The OceanLotus Group, also known as APT32, is a sophisticated threat actor known for targeting organizations in Southeast Asia and other regions.
     - They have been observed using a variety of TTPs, including the use of custom malware, living off the land techniques, and sophisticated C2 communication methods.
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):**
     - DoH is a relatively modern technique that can be used to obfuscate C2 traffic. While it is not a common TTP for all APT groups, it is a plausible method for sophisticated actors to use to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement using Stolen Credentials:**
     - This is a common TTP for many APT groups, including OceanLotus. They often use techniques like Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket, and other credential theft methods to move laterally within a network.
   - **Leveraging Windows Built-in Tools:**
     - Living off the land (LoL) techniques, which involve using built-in Windows tools, are also common in APT attacks. These tools are often used to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and perform other malicious activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of the OceanLotus Group, it is plausible that they would use advanced techniques like DoH for C2 communication to evade detection.
   - The use of stolen credentials for lateral movement and leveraging Windows built-in tools are well-documented TTPs for this group.
   - The sequence described in the question (DoH for C2, followed by lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows tools) aligns with the known capabilities and tactics of the OceanLotus Group.
