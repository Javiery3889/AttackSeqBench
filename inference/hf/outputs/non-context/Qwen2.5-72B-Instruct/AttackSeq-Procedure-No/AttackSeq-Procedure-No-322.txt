### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an app that collects sensitive information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data) and performs routines on an iOS device.
   - The app then uploads files via the FTP protocol.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the app uses encryption for its C2 (Command and Control) channel before uploading files via FTP.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **FTP Protocol:**
     - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. However, FTP is not secure by default as it transmits data in plain text, including usernames, passwords, and file contents.
   - **C2 Channel:**
     - A C2 channel is used by malware to communicate with its controller. This communication often includes commands, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.
   - **Encryption:**
     - Encryption is a common practice in C2 communications to avoid detection and ensure the confidentiality of the data being transmitted.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that the app is collecting sensitive information, it is highly likely that the attackers would want to ensure that this data is not intercepted or tampered with during transmission.
     - Using encryption for the C2 channel would be a standard security measure to protect the data and the communication channel.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the above reasoning, it is highly likely that the app would use encryption for its C2 channel before uploading files via FTP to protect the sensitive data and the communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
