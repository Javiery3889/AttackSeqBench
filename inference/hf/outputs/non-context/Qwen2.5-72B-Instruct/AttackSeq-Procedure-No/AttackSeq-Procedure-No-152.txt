### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Reconnaissance**: Using SharpHound and PowerSploit to gather information.
     - **Discovery**: Gathering output files during the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery**:
     - SharpHound is a tool used for mapping network topology and identifying potential attack paths, which is a common reconnaissance technique.
     - PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for various post-exploitation tasks, including reconnaissance and privilege escalation.
     - Gathering output files during the Discovery phase is consistent with the goal of understanding the network and identifying valuable targets.
   - **Lateral Movement**:
     - Lateral movement is the process of moving from one system to another within a network to gain access to additional resources.
     - Abusing a compromised AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) server's SAML token is a sophisticated technique that can be used for lateral movement.
     - SAML tokens are used for single sign-on (SSO) and can provide access to multiple resources, making them a valuable target for attackers.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that TG1021 has already performed reconnaissance and discovery, it is logical that they would look for ways to leverage the information gathered to move laterally within the network.
   - Compromising an AD FS server and abusing SAML tokens is a high-impact technique that aligns with the goals of a sophisticated threat group like TG1021.
   - The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit suggests that TG1021 is capable of advanced and targeted attacks, making it plausible that they would use such a technique for lateral movement.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
