### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the VERMIN malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Deploying a keylogger component to collect keystrokes and clipboard data.
     2. Collecting system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address).
     3. Using ConfuserEx for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Deployment:**
     - Deploying a keylogger to collect keystrokes and clipboard data is a common initial step in many malware operations. This allows the attacker to gather sensitive information such as passwords and other credentials.
   - **System Information Discovery:**
     - Collecting system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address) is a typical next step in the attack sequence. This information helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Using ConfuserEx, a popular .NET obfuscation tool, for defense evasion is a plausible step to avoid detection by security tools. Obfuscation can make the malware harder to analyze and detect.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Infection and Data Collection:** Deploy the keylogger to gather sensitive data.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Collect system information to understand the environment.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Use obfuscation tools to avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common nature of the described sequence, it is likely that VERMIN will follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
