### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through spear phishing emails containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - The exploit is delivered via a malicious Word document named "Agreement.docx."
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Bankshot implant will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information after being executed via the exploit.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through a spear phishing email with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This is a known method for delivering malware.
   - **Exploitation for Client Execution:**
     - The exploit is delivered via a malicious Word document, which is a common vector for client-side exploits.
   - **Bankshot Implant:**
     - Bankshot is a known implant that can be delivered via such exploits.
   - **Use of COM Object:**
     - COM (Component Object Model) objects are often used by malware to interact with the operating system and gather system information. This is a common technique in post-exploitation activities to understand the environment and plan further actions.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial access is gained through a sophisticated exploit (CVE-2018-4878) and the Bankshot implant is known to be delivered via such methods, it is highly likely that the Bankshot implant will use advanced techniques to gather system information.
   - Using a COM object to execute queries is a common and effective method for gathering system information, which is a crucial step in post-exploitation activities.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Bankshot implant would use a COM object to gather system information after being executed.
