### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access gained through spear phishing emails containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - It then asks if it is likely that the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files before being executed via exploitation in a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spear phishing emails with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This is a common technique used by attackers to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Bankshot Implant:**
     - Bankshot is a known implant used by threat actors. It is typically used for maintaining persistence and furthering the attack.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:**
     - The question suggests that the Bankshot implant communicates with control servers disguised as ZIP files. This is a plausible technique to evade detection, as ZIP files are commonly used and less likely to raise suspicion.
   - **Execution via Malicious Word Document:**
     - The final step involves the Bankshot implant being executed via exploitation in a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx). This is also a common technique where a malicious document is used to execute the payload.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with known attack patterns:
     - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing with an embedded exploit (CVE-2018-4878) is a well-documented method for gaining initial access.
     - **Communication with Control Servers:** Disguising communication as ZIP files is a technique used to avoid detection by network security systems.
     - **Execution via Malicious Document:** Using a malicious Word document to execute the payload is a common method for delivering and running malware.
