### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
     2. Exploiting a chain of zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows to gain initial access.
     3. Achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
     4. Notifying of successful exploitation using a Stager module.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after the entire sequence of TTPs is completed.
     - This implies that the Stager module is designed to wait for all the steps to be completed before sending a notification.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Stager module will not wait for all the steps to be completed before notifying of successful exploitation.
     - This implies that the Stager module might notify at an earlier stage, possibly after the initial access is gained or after the Dropper module is executed.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - In a typical attack sequence, the Stager module is often used to notify the attacker of successful initial access or the successful execution of a critical step in the attack.
   - The question specifies that the Stager module should notify only after the entire sequence of TTPs is completed, which includes:
     - Downloading and executing the Dropper module.
     - Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
     - Achieving privilege escalation using specific CVEs.
   - Given the complexity and the specific order of the TTPs, it is more plausible that the Stager module would wait for all these steps to be completed before notifying the attacker of successful exploitation.

### Final Answer
