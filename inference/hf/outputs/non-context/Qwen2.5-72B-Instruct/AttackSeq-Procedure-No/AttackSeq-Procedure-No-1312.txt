### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Shuckworm malware.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using HTTP requests to communicate with C&C (Command and Control) servers.
     2. Deploying the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel.
     3. Using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **HTTP Requests to C&C Servers:**
     - This is a common initial step for many malware families to establish communication with their C&C infrastructure.
   - **Deploying GOGETTER Tunneler:**
     - GOGETTER is a known tool used to establish secure communication channels, often using protocols like TLS to encrypt traffic.
     - "Yamux" is a multiplexing protocol that can be used to manage multiple streams over a single connection, which is useful for maintaining a persistent and efficient C2 channel.
   - **Using Downloaded Payloads:**
     - Once a secure C2 channel is established, it is common for malware to download additional payloads to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with the typical behavior of advanced malware.
   - Shuckworm, being a sophisticated malware, would likely use a combination of these techniques to ensure robust and secure communication with its C&C servers and to maintain persistence on the compromised system.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
