### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client.
     - CARBANAK RAT beaconing to a Command-and-Control (C2) server.
     - PowerShell RAT communicating with a specific domain.
     - Reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike from separate infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration using SmartFTP Client:**
     - This is typically a final stage in an attack where the attacker has already gained access to the target system and has identified valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - **CARBANAK RAT Beaconing to C2 Server:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to maintain persistence and communicate with the attacker's infrastructure. It usually occurs after initial access and before or during the data exfiltration phase.
   - **PowerShell RAT Communicating with Domain:**
     - This is another method of maintaining persistence and communication with the C2 server. It can occur at various stages of the attack, but often follows initial access and reconnaissance.
   - **Reconnaissance and Data Discovery using Cobalt Strike:**
     - These activities are typically performed early in the attack to understand the target environment and identify valuable data. They are crucial for planning the exfiltration and other post-compromise activities.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if the CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT activities occurred **only after** reconnaissance and data discovery using Cobalt Strike.
   - Given the typical attack lifecycle:
     - **Reconnaissance and Data Discovery** are usually the first steps after gaining initial access.
     - **Beaconing and Communication** with C2 servers often follow to maintain control and exfiltrate data.
     - **Data Exfiltration** is typically the final step.

   - The sequence described in the question (CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT activities occurring only after reconnaissance and data discovery) is plausible and aligns with the typical attack lifecycle.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
