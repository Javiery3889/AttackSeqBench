### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Machete malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Automatically exfiltrating all collected files to remote servers and the C&C server.
     - Using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.
   - The question then asks if Machete is likely to perform additional actions:
     - Steal clipboard contents.
     - Capture screenshots.
     - Stage encrypted data in a temporary folder.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Machete Malware Overview:**
     - Machete is a sophisticated piece of malware known for its multi-stage attack capabilities.
     - It is designed to exfiltrate sensitive data and maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Exfiltration and Data Handling:**
     - The initial actions described (exfiltrating files, using encrypted and compressed transmission) are consistent with Machete's capabilities.
   - **Additional Actions:**
     - **Steal Clipboard Contents:**
       - Stealing clipboard contents is a common technique used by malware to gather sensitive information, such as passwords or other data that users might copy and paste.
     - **Capture Screenshots:**
       - Capturing screenshots is another common technique used by malware to gather visual information about the victim's activities.
     - **Stage Encrypted Data in a Temporary Folder:**
       - Staging data in a temporary folder before exfiltration is a common practice to ensure that the data is organized and ready for transmission.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given Machete's sophisticated nature and its focus on data exfiltration, it is highly plausible that it would perform these additional actions to maximize the amount and quality of data it can steal.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that Machete is likely to steal clipboard contents, capture screenshots, and stage encrypted data in a temporary folder.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
