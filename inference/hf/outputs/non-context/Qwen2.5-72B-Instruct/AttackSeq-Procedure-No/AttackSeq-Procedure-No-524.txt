### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access.
   - After initial access, a COM object is used to execute queries to gather system information.
   - Finally, a PowerShell script is used to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file is a common technique for initial access. This is often done via phishing emails or other social engineering methods.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - Using a COM object to gather system information is a plausible next step. COM (Component Object Model) objects can be used to interact with the operating system and gather various types of information, such as system configuration, user details, and network settings.
   - **Downloading Malware Payload:**
     - Using a PowerShell script to download a zip file containing components for the malware payload is a common technique for further stages of the attack. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks and download files from the internet.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access:** Deliver the malicious document.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Use a COM object to gather system information.
     3. **Malware Deployment:** Use a PowerShell script to download and deploy the malware payload.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common use of these techniques in cyber attacks, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
