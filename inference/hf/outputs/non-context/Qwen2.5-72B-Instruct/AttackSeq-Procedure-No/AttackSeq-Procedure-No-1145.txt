### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals have identified outdated Building Management systems or medical devices that support the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Shodan and Censys** are well-known tools used for internet-wide scanning and searching for devices and services that are exposed to the internet. They are often used by both security researchers and cybercriminals to identify vulnerable systems.
   - **Outdated Building Management systems or medical devices** are often targets for cybercriminals because they may have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
   - **MQTT protocol** is a lightweight messaging protocol commonly used in IoT devices, including medical devices. If these devices are exposed to the internet, they can be discovered and potentially exploited.
   - Given that the cybercriminals have already identified outdated systems and devices, it is logical that they would use tools like Shodan and Censys to further discover and map out the publicly available resources of the medical organizations. This would help them identify additional targets and potential entry points.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, it is highly likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations after identifying outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
