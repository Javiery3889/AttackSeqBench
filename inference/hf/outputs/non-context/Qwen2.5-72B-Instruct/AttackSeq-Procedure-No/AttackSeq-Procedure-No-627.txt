### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - Establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs in the Question:**
     - **Protocol Tunneling over DNS and HTTP:** This is a technique used to communicate with C2 servers in a way that can evade detection by blending in with normal network traffic.
     - **Establishing a C2 Channel:** Once the communication is established, the backdoor can receive commands from the attacker.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network to aid in further actions.
     - **Process Discovery (T1057):** This technique involves the adversary identifying running processes to understand the system's state and to identify potential targets for further exploitation.
     - **System Information Discovery (T1082):** This technique involves the adversary gathering information about the system, such as the operating system, hostname, and domain, to better understand the environment.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After establishing a C2 channel, it is highly likely that the backdoor would perform process discovery and system information discovery to gather information about the compromised system.
   - This information is crucial for the attacker to understand the environment and to plan further actions, such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence.
   - The Discovery phase is a common and logical next step after establishing a C2 channel, as it helps the attacker to tailor their actions to the specific environment they have compromised.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
