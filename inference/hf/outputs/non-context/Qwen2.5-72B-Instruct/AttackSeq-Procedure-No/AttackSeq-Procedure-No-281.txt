### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode is used for command and control (C2) communication.
   - The question then asks if the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **OceanLotus Backdoor:**
     - OceanLotus (also known as APT32) is a sophisticated malware used by a state-sponsored threat group. It is known for its capability to perform various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and system reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - The use of a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode suggests a sophisticated and secure communication channel, which is typical for advanced malware like OceanLotus.
   - **System Reconnaissance:**
     - Gathering system information and victim details is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. This information is often used to tailor further attacks, understand the victim's environment, and exfiltrate valuable data.
   - **Likelihood:**
     - Given the sophistication of OceanLotus and the secure C2 communication, it is highly likely that the backdoor would perform system reconnaissance to gather details such as the victim's name and system information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the OceanLotus backdoor would indeed survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
