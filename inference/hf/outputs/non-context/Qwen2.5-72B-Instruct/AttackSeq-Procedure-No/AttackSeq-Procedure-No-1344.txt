### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - **Initial Access:** AURORA PANDA uses exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware.
   - **Method of Initial Access:** Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization’s website.
   - **Follow-Up Question:** Is it likely that victim exploitation will use BUSHWALK to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for command and control?

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2014-0322:** This is a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
   - **ZxShell Malware:** This is a backdoor malware that can be used for remote access and control.
   - **Strategic Web Compromise (SWC):** This is a technique where attackers compromise a website to deliver malware to visitors.
   - **BUSHWALK:** This is a tool or technique used to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs, which can be used to establish command and control (C2) channels.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Malware Delivery:**
     - AURORA PANDA uses CVE-2014-0322 to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
     - The exploit delivers ZxShell malware to the victim's system.
     - This initial access is achieved through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization’s website.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Establishment:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker needs to establish a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised system.
     - BUSHWALK is a specific tool that modifies the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to establish a C2 channel.
   - **Plausibility of Using BUSHWALK:**
     - While BUSHWALK is a known tool for modifying specific Perl modules on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs, it is not a common or typical follow-up action after an initial web compromise using a browser exploit.
     - The use of BUSHWALK would require the attacker to have specific knowledge of the victim's network and the presence of Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.
     - Given the initial access method (SWC on a website), it is more likely that the attacker would use more common C2 techniques, such as HTTP, DNS, or other standard protocols, rather than a specialized tool like BUSHWALK.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
