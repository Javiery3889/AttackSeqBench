### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access technique using DLL Side-Loading with legitimate executables to load malicious DLLs.
   - It then asks whether APT10 is likely to connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that APT10 will connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence.
     - IPC$ share connection is typically used for remote administration and can be a precursor to lateral movement. However, it is not a necessary step before establishing persistence.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that APT10 will not connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence.
     - Establishing persistence is a critical step for maintaining long-term access to a compromised system. APT10, like many advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, often prioritizes establishing persistence to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - APT10, being a sophisticated APT group, typically follows a structured attack lifecycle. After gaining initial access, their primary goal is to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system.
   - Establishing persistence through methods such as creating services or modifying the Run registry key is a common and effective way to ensure that the malware is executed every time the system starts or a user logs in.
   - Connecting to the IPC$ share on remote machines is more likely to be a step taken after persistence is established, as part of the lateral movement phase to spread to other systems within the network.

### Final Answer: B: No
