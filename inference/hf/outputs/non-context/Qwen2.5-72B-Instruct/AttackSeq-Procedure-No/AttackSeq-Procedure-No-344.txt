### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) following the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution of native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo).
     - Bypassing Windows' ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention) protections.
     - Executing shellcode to download the next stage payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the zero-day exploit does indeed execute the native Windows functions, bypass ASLR and DEP, and then execute shellcode to download the next stage payload.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - **Native Windows Functions:** Exploits often use native Windows functions to gather information about the system, such as file attributes and system information, to ensure the exploit is executed correctly.
       - **Bypassing ASLR and DEP:** These are common techniques used by advanced exploits to gain control over the execution flow and execute arbitrary code.
       - **Executing Shellcode:** Once the protections are bypassed, the exploit can execute shellcode to download and execute the next stage payload.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the zero-day exploit does not follow the described sequence.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - The described sequence is a common and logical progression for a sophisticated exploit.
       - Bypassing ASLR and DEP and executing shellcode are typical steps in the exploitation process, especially for zero-day vulnerabilities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in Answer Choice A.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
