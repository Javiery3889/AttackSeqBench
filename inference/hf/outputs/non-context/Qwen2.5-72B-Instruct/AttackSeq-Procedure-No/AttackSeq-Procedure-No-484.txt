### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
     - **Execution:** Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor.
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications is a common initial access technique. This is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - **Execution:** Running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor is a plausible next step. SparrowDoor is a known tool used for persistence and lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor will modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to activate or deactivate based on the user agent.
     - **DSUserAgentCap.pm:** This module is specific to Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and is used to handle user agent capabilities.
     - **SparrowDoor:** While SparrowDoor is a tool used for persistence and lateral movement, it is not typically known for modifying specific Perl modules on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.
     - **User Agent Manipulation:** Modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm module to activate or deactivate based on the user agent is a very specific and targeted action. It is not a common or widely documented behavior of SparrowDoor.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the specific and targeted nature of modifying the DSUserAgentCap.pm module, and the fact that this is not a known behavior of SparrowDoor, it is unlikely that SparrowDoor would perform this action.

**Final Answer: B: No**
