### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using backdoors to list interesting files (e.g., Office documents).
     2. Potentially uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.
     3. Scanning all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that Gamaredon would automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that Gamaredon would not automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **TTPs and Attack Sequence:**
     - Typically, in a multi-stage attack, an attacker might first gather and exfiltrate initial data (e.g., Office documents) to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
     - However, it is also common for attackers to perform a more thorough scan of the system, including all drives and network shares, to ensure they do not miss any sensitive data before exfiltrating.
   - **Gamaredon's TTPs:**
     - Gamaredon is known for using a variety of TTPs, including backdoors and data exfiltration.
     - They often perform initial reconnaissance and data gathering before moving to more extensive data collection and exfiltration.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is more logical for Gamaredon to first list and potentially upload interesting files to the C&C server to gain initial insights.
     - After gaining initial insights, they would then perform a more thorough scan of all drives to ensure they capture all sensitive data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the typical attack sequence and the known TTPs of Gamaredon, it is more plausible that they would not automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data. Instead, they would likely perform the initial upload and then proceed with a more comprehensive scan.

### Final Answer: B: No
