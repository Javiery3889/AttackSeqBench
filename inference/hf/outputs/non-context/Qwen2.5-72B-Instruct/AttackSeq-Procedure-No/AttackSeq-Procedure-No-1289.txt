### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Mustang Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Utilizing documents to connect to C2 (Command and Control) domains and IP addresses.
     - The question asks if Mustang Panda is likely to use the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) in their spearphishing campaign to evade defenses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTPs of Mustang Panda:**
     - Mustang Panda, also known as APT31, is known for using a variety of TTPs in their campaigns.
     - They often use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments or links to deliver malware.
     - One of their common techniques is to use documents that connect to C2 servers to maintain communication with the attacker.
   - **Double Extension Trick:**
     - The double extension trick (e.g., sample.doc.lnk) is a common technique used in spearphishing to trick users into opening malicious files.
     - The .lnk extension is often hidden by default in Windows, making the file appear as a .doc file to the user.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - Given that Mustang Panda uses spearphishing and malicious documents, it is plausible that they would use the double extension trick to evade defenses and trick users into opening the malicious file.
     - This technique aligns with their goal of delivering malware and maintaining C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is that Mustang Panda is likely to use the double extension trick in their spearphishing campaign.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
