### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Sednit group's AutoIt downloader.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Sending gathered system information to the C&C server.
     2. Performing process discovery by gathering process lists from the victim's machine.
     3. Gaining execution through the Delphi downloader utilizing Windows API to execute commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the AutoIt downloader will perform process discovery (gathering process lists) only after sending system information to the C&C server and before gaining execution through the Delphi downloader.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the AutoIt downloader will not perform process discovery only after sending system information to the C&C server and before gaining execution through the Delphi downloader.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sending System Information to C&C Server:**
     - This is a common initial step in many malware operations to establish a communication channel and provide the attacker with information about the victim's system.
   - **Performing Process Discovery:**
     - Process discovery is often performed to understand the environment and identify potential targets or defenses. It is a logical step to take after establishing communication with the C&C server.
   - **Gaining Execution through Delphi Downloader:**
     - Gaining execution through a Delphi downloader using Windows API to execute commands is a subsequent step, typically performed after gathering necessary information and understanding the environment.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (sending system information, performing process discovery, and then gaining execution) is a logical and common sequence in malware operations.
   - Therefore, the AutoIt downloader is likely to perform process discovery after sending system information to the C&C server and before gaining execution through the Delphi downloader.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
