### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack that initially leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Unpatched Vulnerability:**
     - The attack started with an unpatched vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8. This suggests that the attackers gained initial access by exploiting a known vulnerability in the browser.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The reconnaissance phase is typically the early stage of an attack where attackers gather information about the target. This can include identifying vulnerabilities, mapping the network, and gathering credentials.
   - **Harvesting Credentials vs. Phishing Domains:**
     - **Harvesting Credentials:**
       - Harvesting credentials can be done through various methods, such as keyloggers, credential dumping, or exploiting vulnerabilities that allow access to stored credentials.
       - Given that the initial access was through an unpatched vulnerability, it is plausible that the attackers could have used this access to deploy tools to harvest credentials.
     - **Phishing Domains:**
       - Phishing domains are typically used to trick users into providing their credentials by mimicking legitimate websites.
       - Phishing is a common method for credential harvesting, but it is often used in the initial stages to gain access, not necessarily during the reconnaissance phase after initial access has been achieved.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Since the initial access was gained through an unpatched vulnerability, it is more likely that the attackers would use this access to deploy tools to harvest credentials rather than relying on phishing domains, which are more commonly used for initial access.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
