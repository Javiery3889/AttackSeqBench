### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that Earth Lusca might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Gathering network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and tools like PowerSploit.
     2. Using spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.
     3. Employing software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move malware or tools across the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Gathering Network Configurations and Domain Information:**
     - This is a common reconnaissance technique. Tools like PowerSploit can be used to gather detailed information about the network and domain, which is crucial for planning further attacks.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing emails with malicious links and injecting malicious JavaScript into websites are common techniques for achieving initial access. These methods are often used to trick users into downloading malware or providing credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Once initial access is achieved, attackers often use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move malware or tools across the network. This is a form of lateral movement.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the network and domain.
     2. **Initial Access:** Use social engineering techniques to gain a foothold in the network.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Use deployment tools to spread malware or tools across the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the commonality of these TTPs in cyber attacks, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
