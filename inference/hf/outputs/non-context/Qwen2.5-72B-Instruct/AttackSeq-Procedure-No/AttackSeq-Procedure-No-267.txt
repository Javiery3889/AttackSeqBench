### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Korplug malware.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
     2. Data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
     3. Gathering data from network shared drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Korplug malware will proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol **only** before gathering data from network shared drives.
     - This implies that the malware will not gather data from network shared drives after exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described in the question is not accurate.
     - This implies that the malware may gather data from network shared drives before or after exfiltration, or that the exfiltration step is not the only step before gathering data from network shared drives.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - In typical attack sequences, malware often gathers data from multiple sources (local systems, removable media, and network shared drives) before exfiltrating the data.
   - It is less common for malware to exfiltrate data and then return to gather more data from network shared drives, as this would be less efficient and could increase the risk of detection.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question (exfiltration only before gathering from network shared drives) is less plausible.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
