### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the VERMIN malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting system information using WMI queries.
     - Storing keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that VERMIN will use tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data.
     - This is unlikely because capturing mouse movements is not a common or effective method for exfiltrating sensitive data. Keystrokes and clipboard data are more valuable and commonly targeted by malware for data exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that VERMIN will not use tools to capture mouse movements and will instead store keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in the specified folder.
     - This aligns with common malware behavior, where keystrokes and clipboard data are valuable for stealing credentials and sensitive information.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that VERMIN will store keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in the specified folder, rather than capturing mouse movements.

**Final Answer: B: No**
