### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the authors of Hacking Team's spyware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access.
     - Establishing communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers.
     - Using VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The spearphishing emails with a PDF file are used to gain initial access to the target system. This is a common initial access technique (T1566.002: Spearphishing Attachment in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the malware typically establishes communication with the C&C servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data. This is a crucial step in maintaining control over the compromised system (T1071: Application Layer Protocol in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).
   - **Obfuscation:**
     - VMProtect is a tool used to obfuscate the malware to evade detection by security software. This is often done to ensure the malware remains undetected and can continue to operate on the compromised system (T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information in the MITRE ATT&CK framework).

3. **Logical Sequence:**
   - The logical sequence of events would be:
     1. **Initial Access:** The spearphishing email is delivered, and the user opens the PDF file, which contains the spyware.
     2. **C&C Communication:** The spyware establishes communication with the C&C servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.
     3. **Obfuscation:** The malware uses VMProtect to obfuscate itself to evade detection by security software.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs, it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware established communication with the C&C servers before using VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
