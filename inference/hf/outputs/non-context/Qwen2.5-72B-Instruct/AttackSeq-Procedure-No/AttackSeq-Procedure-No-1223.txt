### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **T9000**: Exfiltration of data to a C2 (Command and Control) server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.
     - **Targeting Skype users**: Automatically capturing data, such as files from removable media.
     - **Stealing sensitive files**: Only after evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T9000 Exfiltration**: This is a known technique where data is exfiltrated to a C2 server using compressed and encrypted traffic to avoid detection. This is a common TTP in advanced persistent threats (APTs).
   - **Targeting Skype Users**: This is a specific targeting technique that might be used to gather more data or spread the malware. However, it is not a typical next step after exfiltration. Usually, after exfiltration, the attacker would focus on maintaining persistence or moving laterally within the network.
   - **Automatically Capturing Data from Removable Media**: This is a technique used to gather additional data, but it is more commonly associated with initial access or data collection phases, not after exfiltration.
   - **Stealing Sensitive Files After Evading Detection**: This is a plausible step, but it is more likely to occur during the initial stages of the attack or during the data collection phase, not after exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not typical. After exfiltrating data, an attacker would usually focus on maintaining access, moving laterally, or preparing for the next exfiltration. Targeting Skype users and capturing data from removable media are more likely to occur during the initial stages of the attack or during the data collection phase.
   - The step of customizing the installation to avoid detection is a common technique used during the initial stages to avoid detection by security products and researchers.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible based on typical attack patterns and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
