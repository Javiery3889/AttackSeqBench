### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - It communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which were encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Communication:**
     - The initial reconnaissance and communication with control servers are common initial steps in many cyber attacks. These steps help the attacker understand the environment and establish a command and control (C2) channel.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Data exfiltration is a common next step after reconnaissance and establishing a C2 channel. Attackers often need to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system.
   - **Use of GitHub for Data Exfiltration:**
     - GitHub is a popular platform for hosting code and other files. It can be used for data exfiltration because it is a legitimate service that is less likely to be blocked by network security measures.
     - Using GitHub for data exfiltration is a known technique. Attackers can create repositories or use existing ones to upload stolen data, making it appear as normal traffic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration. The use of GitHub aligns with the attacker's need to exfiltrate data in a way that is less likely to be detected by network security measures.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
