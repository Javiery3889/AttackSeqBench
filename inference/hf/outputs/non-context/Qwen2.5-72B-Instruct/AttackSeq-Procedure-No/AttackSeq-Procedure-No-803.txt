### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the threat group FIN4.
   - Specifically, it inquires whether FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials only after relying on Tor for anonymous communication during their command and control phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Credential Access Phase:** FIN4 transmits stolen credentials to their C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** FIN4 uses Tor for anonymous communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that FIN4 uses Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase and then uses C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials.
     - However, this sequence is not typical. Generally, C2 servers are used for both command and control and data exfiltration, including the transmission of stolen credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that FIN4 does not use Tor for anonymous communication during the command and control phase and then use C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials.
     - This is more plausible because C2 servers are typically used for both command and control and data exfiltration, and using Tor for command and control would be an additional layer of complexity that is not commonly reported for FIN4.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - FIN4 is known for using C2 servers for both command and control and data exfiltration. While Tor can be used for anonymous communication, it is not a common practice for FIN4 to use Tor for command and control and then switch to C2 servers for data exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that FIN4 does not use Tor for command and control and then use C2 servers for collecting stolen credentials.

### Final Answer: B: No
