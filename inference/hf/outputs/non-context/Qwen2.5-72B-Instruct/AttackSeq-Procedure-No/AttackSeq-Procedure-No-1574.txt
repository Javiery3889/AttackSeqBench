### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group Earth Lusca.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Scanning for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
     2. Gathering account credentials via a BlackEnergy keylogger plugin.
     3. Exploiting remote services for lateral movement within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning for Machines:**
     - This is a common initial step in a cyber attack to identify potential targets within the network. Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan are used to scan for open ports and services.
   - **Gathering Account Credentials:**
     - After identifying potential targets, the next logical step is to gather credentials to gain access to these targets. Using a keylogger plugin like the one in BlackEnergy is a plausible method to gather account credentials.
   - **Exploiting Remote Services:**
     - Once credentials are obtained, the attacker can use them to exploit remote services for lateral movement within the network. This is a common technique to spread the attack and gain deeper access to the network.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical and common attack pattern:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Scanning for Machines):** Identify potential targets.
     2. **Credential Access (Gathering Account Credentials):** Obtain necessary credentials.
     3. **Lateral Movement (Exploiting Remote Services):** Use the credentials to move laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical and common nature of the sequence described, it is likely that Earth Lusca will follow this sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
