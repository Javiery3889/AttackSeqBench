### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document.
     - Dropping an HTA file.
     - The HTA file potentially communicating with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for Command and Control (C2).
     - Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited through RTF documents to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Dropping an HTA file:**
     - HTA (HTML Application) files can be used to execute scripts and other code, making them a common payload in such attacks.
   - **Communicating with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for C2:**
     - These cloud storage services can be used for C2 communication, but it is not a common or typical sequence in the context of the described attack.
   - **Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading:**
     - DLL sideloading is a technique used to execute malicious code by loading a legitimate application with a malicious DLL. This is a common technique for defense evasion.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - The sequence of exploiting CVE-2017-11882, dropping an HTA file, and executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - However, the step of communicating with Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for C2 is less common and less typical in this specific sequence. Typically, C2 communication would be more direct, such as through a custom C2 server or a more common service like a web server.

### Final Answer:
B: No

The sequence described in the question, particularly the communication with cloud storage services for C2, is less plausible and not a typical step in the described attack sequence.
