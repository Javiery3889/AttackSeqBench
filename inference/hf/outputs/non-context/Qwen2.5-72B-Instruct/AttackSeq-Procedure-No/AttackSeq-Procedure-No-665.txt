### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by threat actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - Employing Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash for credential access.
     - Moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
     - Running commands to perform permission groups discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Mimikatz and Impacket for Credential Access:**
     - Mimikatz is a well-known tool for dumping credentials from memory.
     - Impacket tools can be used to execute pass-the-hash, allowing threat actors to authenticate using stolen credentials without the actual password.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - AntSword is a webshell management tool that can be used to execute commands on a compromised web server.
     - Impacket's `atexec` can be used to execute commands on remote systems, facilitating lateral movement.
   - **Permission Groups Discovery:**
     - This step involves running commands to identify user and group permissions on the target system, which is typically done to understand the level of access and to identify potential targets for further exploitation.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - **Step 1:** Threat actors use Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     - **Step 2:** They use Impacket tools to execute pass-the-hash, gaining access to other systems.
     - **Step 3:** They move laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
     - **Step 4:** They run commands to perform permission groups discovery.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is logical for threat actors to perform permission groups discovery after gaining access to a new system through lateral movement. This helps them understand the environment and identify further targets.
     - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that they will run permission groups discovery **only after** moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.
     - This implies that they would not perform permission groups discovery at any other point in the attack sequence, which is less likely. Threat actors often perform reconnaissance and discovery at multiple stages of the attack to gather as much information as possible.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the typical behavior of threat actors, it is not likely that they will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec. They are more likely to perform such discovery at multiple stages of the attack.

**Final Answer: B: No**
