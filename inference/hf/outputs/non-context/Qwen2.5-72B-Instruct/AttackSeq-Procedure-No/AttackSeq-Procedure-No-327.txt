### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack lifecycle.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Sending gathered information.
     - Writing log messages.
     - Using a token for communication.
     - Uploading files during the Command and Control (C2) phase.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the app will subsequently collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The C2 phase involves the malware communicating with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - The described actions (sending gathered information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files) are typical of the C2 phase.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Discovery phase involves the malware gathering information about the victim's device and environment to understand what it can exploit or exfiltrate.
     - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data is a common activity in the Discovery phase, as this information can be valuable for further attacks or exfiltration.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (C2 phase activities) is followed by a question about the Discovery phase.
   - It is logical for the malware to move from the C2 phase to the Discovery phase to gather more information about the victim's device.
   - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data is a typical activity in the Discovery phase, as it helps the attacker understand the victim's environment and plan further actions.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
