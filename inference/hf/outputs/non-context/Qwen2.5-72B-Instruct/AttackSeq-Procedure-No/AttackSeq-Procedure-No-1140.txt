### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker might use.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Deploying the 'Recon' module group to gather initial system information.
     2. Determining subsequent actions based on the gathered information.
     3. Injecting a malicious DLL into the AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService to backdoor Azure AD Pass-Through Authentication.
     4. Using the 'Spreading' module group to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Recon Module Group:**
     - This is a common first step in many cyber attacks. The attacker gathers information about the target system to plan further actions.
   - **Injecting a Malicious DLL:**
     - This is a sophisticated technique that involves injecting a malicious DLL into a specific service (AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService) to backdoor Azure AD Pass-Through Authentication. This is a targeted and advanced move.
   - **Spreading Module Group:**
     - This involves using techniques like MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials to spread the infection to other hosts on the network. This is typically done after gaining a foothold and possibly after establishing persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question is plausible. After gathering initial system information (Recon), the attacker would likely use that information to determine the next steps.
     - Injecting a malicious DLL into a critical service like AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService is a logical next step to gain deeper access and control over the network.
     - Once the attacker has established a backdoor, they would then use the 'Spreading' module group to infect other hosts, which is a common tactic to expand the attack footprint.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the typical behavior of advanced attackers, the described sequence is plausible.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
