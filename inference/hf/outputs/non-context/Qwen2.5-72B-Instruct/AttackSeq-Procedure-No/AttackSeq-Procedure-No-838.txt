### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, etc.).
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Spear-phishing campaigns to gain initial access.
     2. Installation and execution of a VBA script (vba_macro.exe).
     3. Dropping malware (FONTCACHE.DAT).
     4. Leveraging tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing Campaigns:**
     - APT28 is known for using spear-phishing to gain initial access to target networks. This is a common and well-documented TTP for this group.
   - **VBA Script (vba_macro.exe):**
     - APT28 often uses VBA macros in exploit documents to execute malicious code. This is a plausible next step after gaining initial access through spear-phishing.
   - **Dropping Malware (FONTCACHE.DAT):**
     - FONTCACHE.DAT is a known malware used by APT28. It is often dropped by the VBA script to establish a foothold in the network.
   - **Leveraging Tools (CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, SOURFACE):**
     - These are advanced tools used by APT28 for various purposes such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. Using these tools after establishing initial access and dropping malware is consistent with their operational behavior.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear-phishing to deliver exploit documents, which is a well-documented TTP.
   - **Execution of VBA Script:**
     - The VBA script (vba_macro.exe) is a common method to execute malicious code and drop additional payloads.
   - **Dropping Malware:**
     - FONTCACHE.DAT is a known malware used by APT28, and it is logical to drop this after the VBA script has executed.
   - **Leveraging Advanced Tools:**
     - Tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE are used for further operations, which aligns with the group's advanced capabilities and operational goals.
