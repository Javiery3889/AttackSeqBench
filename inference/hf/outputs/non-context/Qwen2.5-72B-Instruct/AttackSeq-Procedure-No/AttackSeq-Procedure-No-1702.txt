### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries exploit a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) through spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - It asks whether it is likely that the adversaries compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor to support this attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This would imply that the adversaries not only used spear phishing emails to exploit the Microsoft Office vulnerability but also compromised legitimate web browser updates to deliver a backdoor.
     - Compromising legitimate web browser updates is a sophisticated and high-risk activity that requires significant resources and access. It is typically used in more advanced and targeted attacks.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This would imply that the adversaries used only spear phishing emails to exploit the Microsoft Office vulnerability and did not compromise legitimate web browser updates.
     - Spear phishing is a common and effective method for initial access, especially when combined with a known vulnerability like CVE-2021-40444.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of spear phishing emails to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) is a well-documented and common TTP. It is a relatively straightforward method for gaining initial access.
   - Compromising legitimate web browser updates is a more complex and less common TTP. It is usually reserved for more sophisticated and targeted attacks where the adversaries have significant resources and a high level of access.
   - Given the context of the question, it is more plausible that the adversaries used the simpler and more common method of spear phishing without the need to compromise legitimate web browser updates.

### Final Answer: B: No
