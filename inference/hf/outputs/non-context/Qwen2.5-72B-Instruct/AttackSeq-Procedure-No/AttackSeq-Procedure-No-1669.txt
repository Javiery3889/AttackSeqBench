### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the TDrop2 malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with C2 (Command and Control) servers.
     - Using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
     - Leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after establishing communication with the C2 servers, the malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.
     - This is a common next step in many malware attack sequences. Once a malware has established a connection with its C2 server, it often performs discovery to gather information about the compromised system and network. This information can be used to further the attack, such as identifying valuable data, finding other targets, or determining the best way to exfiltrate data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not perform discovery activities after establishing communication with the C2 servers.
     - This is less likely because discovery is a crucial step in many attack sequences. Without performing discovery, the malware would have limited information about the environment it is operating in, which could hinder its ability to carry out further malicious activities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the common attack patterns and the logical progression of TTPs, it is more plausible that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities after establishing communication with the C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
