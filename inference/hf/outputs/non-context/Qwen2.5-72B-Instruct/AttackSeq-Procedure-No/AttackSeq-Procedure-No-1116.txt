### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence starts with spear phishing emails delivering LODEINFO malware via Office macro files.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use valid account information (e.g., VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks before injecting malicious code into the `svchost.exe` process for execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear Phishing and LODEINFO Malware:**
     - Spear phishing is a common initial access technique (T1192) where attackers send targeted emails to specific individuals to trick them into opening malicious attachments or clicking on malicious links.
     - LODEINFO is a known malware that can be delivered via Office macro files, which is a common technique (T1204.002) for initial infection.

   - **Using Valid Account Information:**
     - Once the initial infection occurs, it is common for malware to attempt to gather valid account information (T1081) to maintain persistence and move laterally within the network.
     - Using valid account information to remotely access victim networks (T1021) is a typical next step, especially for accessing resources like VPNs or other remote access points.

   - **Injecting Malicious Code into svchost.exe:**
     - After gaining access to the network, the malware might inject malicious code into legitimate processes to avoid detection. `svchost.exe` is a common target for process injection (T1055) because it is a legitimate Windows process that runs many system services.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is highly plausible and aligns with common attack patterns observed in the wild.
   - The use of spear phishing to deliver malware, followed by the use of valid account information for remote access, and then process injection into `svchost.exe` is a well-documented and logical sequence of TTPs.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
