### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. **Initial Access:** A phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro.
     2. **Execution:** The VBA macro is used to execute commands.
     3. **Persistence:** A scheduled task is created to execute `mshta.exe` with a specific URL every two hours.
     4. **Command and Control (C2):** `mshta.exe` is used to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails with malicious documents are a common initial access vector (T1566).
     - The use of a VBA macro in a PowerPoint add-in to execute commands is a known technique (T1204.002).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task to maintain persistence is a common technique (T1053).
     - Using `mshta.exe` to execute a URL is a known method for persistence and command execution (T1218.005).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - `mshta.exe` is often used to download and execute payloads from remote URLs (T1115, T1218.005).
     - Blogspot URLs are sometimes used by attackers to host malicious content (T1105).

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known attack patterns.
   - The use of a VBA macro to execute commands and then create a scheduled task for persistence is a logical progression.
   - The use of `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL is a common technique for maintaining command and control.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
