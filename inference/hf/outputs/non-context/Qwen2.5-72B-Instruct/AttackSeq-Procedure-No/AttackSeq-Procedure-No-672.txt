### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will attempt to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures before collecting credentials and usernames from the victim's environment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via Docker API Exploit:**
     - Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports is a common initial access technique. This allows attackers to gain a foothold in the victim's environment by leveraging the exposed API to execute commands or deploy malicious containers.
   - **Bypassing Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW):**
     - MOTW is a security feature in Windows that marks files downloaded from the internet to prevent them from being executed without user interaction. This is typically relevant when dealing with files downloaded from the internet, such as malicious executables or scripts.
   - **Collecting Credentials and Usernames:**
     - After gaining initial access, attackers often move to collect credentials and usernames to further their access and control over the environment. This can be done through various techniques such as credential dumping, keylogging, or exploiting local security misconfigurations.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Relevance of MOTW in the Context:**
     - Given that the initial access is gained through a Docker API exploit, the attackers are already inside the victim's environment. They do not need to bypass MOTW to execute files or scripts, as they can directly interact with the system.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The logical sequence of actions for an attacker after gaining initial access would be to establish a foothold, then move to collect credentials and usernames to further their access. Bypassing MOTW is not a necessary step in this context.

### Final Answer:
B: No
