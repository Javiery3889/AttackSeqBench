### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the 'Recon' module group, which is used to gather initial system information and determine subsequent actions.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the 'Spreading' module group will attempt to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials from various applications and resources.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Recon Module Group:**
     - This module is typically used to gather information about the target system, such as network topology, open ports, running services, and user accounts. This information is crucial for planning the next steps in the attack.
   - **Spreading Module Group:**
     - This module is used to propagate the attack to other hosts on the network. Techniques like exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., MS08-067) or using stolen admin credentials are common methods for spreading.
   - **Password Module Group:**
     - This module is used to steal credentials from various applications and resources. This can include techniques like keylogging, credential dumping, and brute-forcing.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After the 'Recon' module group has gathered initial information, the next logical step is to use the 'Spreading' module group to infect other hosts on the network. This is because the attacker would want to expand their foothold and gain control over more systems.
     - Once the attacker has control over multiple hosts, they can then use the 'Password' module group to steal credentials from various applications and resources on those hosts. This is because having control over multiple hosts provides more opportunities to gather credentials.
   - **Timing:**
     - It is more efficient and strategic to spread the attack before attempting to steal credentials. Spreading the attack first allows the attacker to gain a broader presence on the network, which can then be used to gather more credentials.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
