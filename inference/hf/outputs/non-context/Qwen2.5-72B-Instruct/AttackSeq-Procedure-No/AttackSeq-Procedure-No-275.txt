### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the malware Korplug.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.
     - Communication with C&C (Command and Control) servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
     - Collection of metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration via Compressed and Encrypted TCP Messages:**
     - This is a common technique used by malware to exfiltrate data in a way that is difficult to detect and analyze.
   - **Communication with C&C Servers Using a Custom TCP-Based Protocol Over Non-Standard Ports:**
     - This is also a common technique to avoid detection by network security systems, which often monitor standard ports.
   - **Collection of Metadata and Content from All Mapped Drives, Removable Media, and Network Shared Drives:**
     - This is typically done before data exfiltration to gather the data that will be exfiltrated.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question implies that the communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports happens **after** the data exfiltration.
   - However, in a typical attack sequence, the malware would first collect the data (metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives) and then exfiltrate it.
   - The communication with C&C servers is often used to send the exfiltrated data, so it would logically happen after the data collection and exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question (data exfiltration, then communication with C&C servers, then data collection) is not logical. The data collection should happen before the exfiltration and communication with C&C servers.

### Final Answer: B: No
