### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Black Energy 2 is likely to use steganography to hide its C2 (Command and Control) communications before injecting a DLL into the `svchost.exe` process to maintain persistence.
   - Key TTPs mentioned:
     - Steganography for C2 communications
     - DLL injection into `svchost.exe`
     - Persistence

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Steganography for C2 Communications:**
     - Steganography is a technique used to hide data within other data, often used to evade detection by blending in with normal network traffic. While it is a known technique in the cybersecurity domain, it is not a common or primary method used by Black Energy 2 for C2 communications.
   - **DLL Injection into `svchost.exe`:**
     - DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, often to maintain persistence and evade detection. Black Energy 2 is known to use DLL injection as one of its persistence mechanisms.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Maintaining persistence is a critical goal for many malware families, including Black Energy 2. Injecting a DLL into `svchost.exe` is a well-documented method for achieving this.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - While DLL injection into `svchost.exe` is a plausible and documented technique used by Black Energy 2, the use of steganography for C2 communications is less common and not typically associated with this malware.
   - The primary methods for C2 communications in Black Energy 2 include more straightforward techniques such as HTTP or DNS requests, which are easier to implement and maintain.

### Final Answer:
B: No
