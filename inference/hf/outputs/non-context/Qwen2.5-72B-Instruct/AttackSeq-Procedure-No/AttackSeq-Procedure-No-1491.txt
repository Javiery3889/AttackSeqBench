### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Iranian hackers are likely to have attempted to gain initial access by using social media platforms and sending spear-phishing messages before developing fake personas and a fictitious news organization for reconnaissance activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Using social media platforms and sending spear-phishing messages.
   - **Reconnaissance:** Developing fake personas and a fictitious news organization.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (Spear-Phishing and Social Media):**
     - Spear-phishing is a common initial access technique where attackers send targeted emails or messages to specific individuals to gain unauthorized access to systems or information.
     - Social media platforms are often used to gather information about targets and to send spear-phishing messages.
   - **Reconnaissance (Fake Personas and Fictitious News Organization):**
     - Developing fake personas and a fictitious news organization is a more advanced and time-consuming reconnaissance technique.
     - These techniques are typically used to gather detailed information about the target and to build trust over a longer period.

4. **Logical Sequence:**
   - It is logical for attackers to use simpler and quicker methods (like spear-phishing) to gain initial access before engaging in more complex and resource-intensive reconnaissance activities.
   - Once initial access is gained, attackers can use the compromised systems to gather more detailed information, which can then be used to develop more sophisticated personas and fictitious organizations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical progression of attack techniques, it is highly likely that Iranian hackers would attempt to gain initial access through social media and spear-phishing before developing more advanced reconnaissance methods.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
