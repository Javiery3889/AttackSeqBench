### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the malware WinDealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Communication with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     2. Collection and processing of data from various sources (USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin contents, and SNS application folders).
     3. Storing the processed data in ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory.
     4. Exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will collect and process data and store it in the %TEMP% directory only after exfiltrating the data to the C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the malware will not follow the sequence described in the question.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Typically, in a malware attack sequence, the data collection and processing steps are performed before exfiltration. This is because the malware needs to gather and prepare the data before sending it to the C2 server.
   - The sequence described in the question (collecting and processing data, storing it in the %TEMP% directory, and then exfiltrating it) is a logical and common sequence in malware operations.
   - If the malware were to exfiltrate the data before collecting and processing it, it would not have any data to send, which would defeat the purpose of the attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
