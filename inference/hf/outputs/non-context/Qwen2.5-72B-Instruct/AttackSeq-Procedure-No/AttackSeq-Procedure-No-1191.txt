### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Spear Phishing Document:** This is a common initial access technique where a targeted email with a malicious attachment or link is used to gain entry into the victim's system.
     - **Exploiting CVE-2012-0158:** This is a specific vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
     - **Dropping Malicious Components:** The attack involves dropping malicious files such as `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll` on the victim's system.
     - **Targeting the ASEAN Region:** The question asks if the attack specifically targets the ASEAN region.
     - **Decoy Document for Reconnaissance:** The question also mentions the use of a decoy document, which is often used to distract the victim while the attacker performs reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the attack does target the ASEAN region and uses a decoy document for reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the attack does not target the ASEAN region and does not use a decoy document for reconnaissance.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Exploitation:**
     - The use of a spear phishing document to exploit CVE-2012-0158 is a common TTP in targeted attacks. This technique is often used to gain initial access to a victim's system.
   - **Dropping Malicious Components:**
     - Dropping `wab.exe` and `wab32res.dll` is a typical next step after gaining access, as these files can be used to establish persistence or perform further actions on the victim's system.
   - **Targeting the ASEAN Region:**
     - The question specifically asks if the attack targets the ASEAN region. While the initial TTPs are common in many attacks, the targeting of a specific region is a key indicator of a targeted campaign.
   - **Decoy Document for Reconnaissance:**
     - The use of a decoy document is a common technique in targeted attacks to distract the victim while the attacker performs reconnaissance. This is often done to gather information about the victim's network and systems.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the specific mention of the ASEAN region and the use of a decoy document for reconnaissance, it is plausible that the attack is indeed targeting the ASEAN region and using these techniques to gather information.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
