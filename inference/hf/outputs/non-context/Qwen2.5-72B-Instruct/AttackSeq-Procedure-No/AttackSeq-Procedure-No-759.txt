### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers:
     - Verify victims' credentials in real-time.
     - Prompt for the 2-step verification code.
     - Consider using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after verifying credentials and prompting for the 2-step verification code, attackers will use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Using images instead of text in phishing emails is a common technique to evade detection by email security systems, including those used by Google. This is because many security systems rely on text-based analysis to identify phishing attempts.
       - However, this technique is typically used in the initial stages of the attack to bypass initial filters, not necessarily after the credentials have been verified and the 2-step verification code has been prompted.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that after verifying credentials and prompting for the 2-step verification code, attackers will not use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.
     - **Reasoning:**
       - Once the attackers have verified the credentials and obtained the 2-step verification code, they have already bypassed a significant portion of the security measures.
       - At this point, the focus is likely on maintaining access and exfiltrating data rather than evading initial detection mechanisms.
       - Using images instead of text might be a technique used in the initial phishing attempt to gain access, but it is less relevant after the credentials have been verified and the 2-step verification code has been obtained.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after verifying credentials and prompting for the 2-step verification code, attackers will not use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

**Final Answer: B: No**
