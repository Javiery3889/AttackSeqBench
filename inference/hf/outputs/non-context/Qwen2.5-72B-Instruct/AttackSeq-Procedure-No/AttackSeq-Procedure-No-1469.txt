### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that a threat actor might use.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance activities** (gathering publicly available information and active discovery methods).
     - **Malicious implants** (specifically BlackEnergy 3).
     - **Communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers**.
     - **Installation through employee-enabled macro execution**.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Threat actors gather information about the target to plan their attack.
   - **Malicious Implants (BlackEnergy 3):**
     - BlackEnergy 3 is a known malware that has been used in various cyber attacks, particularly in targeted campaigns.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - Malware typically needs to communicate with C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Installation through Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:**
     - Malware can be delivered through phishing emails containing malicious macros in documents. When an employee enables the macro, the malware is executed and installed on the network.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious implants will establish communication with C2 servers **only** before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
   - This implies a sequence where the malware communicates with the C2 server before it is even installed on the network.
   - In reality, the typical sequence is:
     1. **Reconnaissance** (gathering information).
     2. **Delivery** (sending the malicious document to the target).
     3. **Execution** (employee enabling the macro, which installs the malware).
     4. **C2 Communication** (malware communicating with the C2 server after installation).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not typical. Malware usually communicates with C2 servers after it has been installed on the network, not before.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not likely that the malicious implants will establish communication with C2 servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

### Final Answer: B: No
