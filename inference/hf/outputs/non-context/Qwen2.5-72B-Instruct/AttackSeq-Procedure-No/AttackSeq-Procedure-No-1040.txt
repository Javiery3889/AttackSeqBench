### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with the exploitation of the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the Inception attackers will create a scheduled task (specifically \Microsoft\Windows\PLA\Server Manager Performance Monitor) to establish persistence before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access via CVE-2017-11882:**
     - CVE-2017-11882 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a common initial access vector.
   - **Creating a Scheduled Task for Persistence:**
     - Creating a scheduled task is a common technique used by attackers to ensure that their malware or backdoor is executed regularly, even if the system is restarted. This is a form of persistence.
   - **Deploying the PowerShell Backdoor POWERSHOWER:**
     - POWERSHOWER is a known PowerShell-based backdoor used by the Inception group. Deploying a backdoor is a common next step after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Initial Access:** The attackers exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - **Persistence:** To maintain access, it is logical for the attackers to create a scheduled task to ensure that their backdoor is executed regularly.
     - **Backdoor Deployment:** After establishing persistence, the attackers would deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Plausibility:**
     - The sequence described in the question (exploit -> create scheduled task for persistence -> deploy backdoor) is a common and logical sequence of actions for an attacker.
     - The specific scheduled task \Microsoft\Windows\PLA\Server Manager Performance Monitor is a plausible choice for persistence, as it is a legitimate-looking task that might not raise immediate suspicion.
