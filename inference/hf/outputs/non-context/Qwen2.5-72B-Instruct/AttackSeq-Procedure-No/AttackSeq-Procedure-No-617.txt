### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Hidden Cobra.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Resource Development**: Developing the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files.
     - **Initial Access**: Targeting Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development**: The development of the Bankshot implants is a plausible step in the attack lifecycle. It aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK framework's Resource Development tactic, which involves preparing the necessary tools and infrastructure for an attack.
   - **Initial Access**: Using spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document to exploit CVE-2018-4878 is a common technique for gaining initial access. This aligns with the Initial Access tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Targeting Turkish Financial Organizations**: Hidden Cobra, also known as Lazarus Group, has a history of targeting financial institutions, including those in Turkey. This makes the targeting of Turkish financial organizations plausible.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the alignment of the described TTPs with known attack patterns and the historical behavior of Hidden Cobra, it is likely that they would use these techniques to target Turkish financial organizations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
