### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Process Discovery**: The backdoor performs process discovery to understand what processes are running on the compromised system.
     - **System Information Discovery**: The backdoor gathers information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, and network configuration.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Process Discovery and System Information Discovery** are common techniques used in the **Discovery** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These techniques help the attacker understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **C2 (Command and Control)** is a separate phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where the attacker establishes and maintains control over the compromised system.
   - **Blogs and WordPress** are often used as C2 infrastructure because they are widely available, easy to set up, and can blend in with normal web traffic, making them less likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - Given the nature of the CostaRicto Campaign and the SombRAT backdoor, it is plausible that the attackers would use common and easily accessible platforms like blogs and WordPress for C2 to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
