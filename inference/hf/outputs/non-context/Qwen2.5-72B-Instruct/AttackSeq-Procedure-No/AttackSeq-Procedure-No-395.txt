### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method (spear-phishing emails) used by APT41.
   - It then asks if it is likely that APT41 would conduct reconnaissance activities targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **APT41 Background:**
     - APT41 is a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since at least 2012.
     - They are known for their sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving multiple stages of reconnaissance and data exfiltration.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are a common initial access vector for APT groups, including APT41. This method is effective for gaining a foothold in target networks.
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:**
     - Once initial access is gained, APT groups typically conduct reconnaissance to understand the network environment and identify valuable data.
     - Targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems aligns with the types of reconnaissance activities APT41 has been known to perform. These activities can provide valuable intelligence on targets and their activities.
   - **Historical Context:**
     - APT41 has been known to target a wide range of industries, including telecommunications and hospitality, which suggests that they would be interested in call records and hotel reservation data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of APT41 and their known tactics, it is highly likely that they would conduct such reconnaissance activities after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
