### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence starts with the use of functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the **Reconnaissance** phase to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages for delivery or retrieval by victims during the **Resource Development** phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - DOCKERGEDDON is a tool used to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in Docker APIs. This is a common technique in the Reconnaissance phase to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The Resource Development phase involves preparing the tools, infrastructure, and resources needed for the attack. This can include developing or acquiring malware, setting up command and control (C2) servers, and creating malicious payloads.
   - **Malicious npm Packages:**
     - Developing malicious npm packages is a common technique used to deliver malware to victims. These packages can be uploaded to public repositories and trick developers into installing them, which can then be used to compromise systems.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After successfully identifying and compromising Docker APIs during the Reconnaissance phase, adversaries would likely move to the Resource Development phase to prepare for further exploitation.
   - Developing malicious npm packages is a logical step in the Resource Development phase because it provides a method to deliver or retrieve malicious payloads to or from the compromised systems.
   - The use of malicious npm packages can help adversaries maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities on the compromised systems.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
