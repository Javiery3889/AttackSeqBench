### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Obfuscation** of the backdoor payload for defense evasion.
     - **Initial Access** gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     - **Execution** of these scripts through macro-triggered events.
     - **Persistence** achieved by dropping components like `invoker.ps1` using decoded scripts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is likely.
     - The sequence aligns with common attack patterns:
       - **Obfuscation** is a common technique to evade detection.
       - **Initial Access** through malicious documents with embedded scripts is a well-known method.
       - **Execution** of scripts through macros is a typical way to run malicious code.
       - **Persistence** is often achieved by dropping additional components after initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is unlikely.
     - This would imply that the described sequence is not a common or logical progression of TTPs, which is not supported by typical attack patterns.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a plausible and common sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence after gaining initial access through the described methods.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
