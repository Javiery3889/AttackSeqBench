### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where attackers use increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals.
   - It then asks whether attackers will ensure persistence within the target network only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence** is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework that involves techniques to maintain access to a system over an extended period.
   - **Execution** is another tactic that involves techniques to run malicious code on a system.
   - The question implies a sequence where:
     1. Attackers gain increased privileges.
     2. They spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals.
     3. They execute malicious code.
     4. They ensure persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - In many attack scenarios, ensuring persistence is a critical step that often follows the execution of malicious code. This is because:
     - **Execution** of malicious code is necessary to perform actions that can establish persistence.
     - **Persistence** techniques, such as creating new accounts, modifying registry keys, or installing backdoors, typically require the execution of some form of malicious code.
   - Therefore, it is logical to assume that attackers will ensure persistence only after they have successfully executed malicious code on a local or remote system.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
