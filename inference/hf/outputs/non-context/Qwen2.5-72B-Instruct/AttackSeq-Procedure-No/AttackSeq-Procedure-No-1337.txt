### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where malware connects back to an exploit domain for command and control (C2) communication.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion after the C2 communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Establishing a C2 connection is a common TTP used by malware to receive commands, exfiltrate data, or download additional payloads.
   - **Sideloading Techniques:**
     - Sideloading is a technique where malware uses a legitimate application to load a malicious DLL. This is often used to evade detection by security software, as the legitimate application is trusted.
   - **Evasion:**
     - Evasion techniques are used to avoid detection by security systems. Deploying a malicious DLL via sideloading is a form of evasion.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - After establishing a C2 connection, it is common for malware to download additional payloads or execute further stages of the attack.
   - Sideloading is a sophisticated technique that can be used to deploy a malicious DLL, which can then be used to maintain persistence, execute additional malicious activities, or evade detection.
   - Given that the malware has already established a C2 connection, it is plausible that the next step could involve deploying a malicious DLL using sideloading to establish evasion.
