### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The first action is compressing valuable intelligence into archives using tools like WinRAR or 7-zip.
   - The second action is discovering databases, servers, and open ports using tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' for network mapping and scanning.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - Compressing valuable intelligence into archives is typically a post-exploitation activity. This is done after the attacker has already gained access to the target system and has collected the data they need.
     - Discovering databases, servers, and open ports using network mapping and scanning tools is a pre-exploitation activity. This is done to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities before the actual attack.
   - **Temporal Order:**
     - It is more logical for the attacker to perform network mapping and scanning first to identify targets and vulnerabilities.
     - Once the targets are identified and the attacker has gained access, they would then proceed to collect and compress the valuable intelligence.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The attacker uses tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' to map the network and identify potential targets and open ports.
   - **Step 2:** The attacker gains access to the identified targets.
   - **Step 3:** The attacker collects valuable intelligence from the compromised systems.
   - **Step 4:** The attacker compresses the collected intelligence into archives using tools like WinRAR or 7-zip.

### Conclusion
Given the logical and temporal order of the attack sequence, it is not likely that the Fox Kitten Campaign would compress valuable intelligence into archives after discovering databases, servers, and open ports using network mapping and scanning tools. The network mapping and scanning should come first.

**Final Answer: B: No**
