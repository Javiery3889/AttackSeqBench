### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files for **Credential Access**.
     2. Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using **Tor hidden services**.
     3. Enumerating system data directories and GPS information to facilitate **Discovery**.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access**: Deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files is a plausible technique for gaining access to credentials. This aligns with the **Credential Access** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exfiltration**: Automatically exfiltrating the collected files using Tor hidden services is a plausible technique for **Exfiltration**. Tor hidden services are often used to anonymize the exfiltration process.
   - **Discovery**: Enumerating system data directories and GPS information is a plausible technique for **Discovery**. This phase involves gathering information about the system and its environment to plan further actions.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. **Credential Access** (using `tcpdump`).
     2. **Exfiltration** (using Tor hidden services).
     3. **Discovery** (enumerating system data directories and GPS information).
   - This sequence is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     - First, the attacker gains access to credentials.
     - Then, the attacker exfiltrates the collected data.
     - Finally, the attacker performs discovery to gather more information about the system.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of TTPs.
   - There is no inherent contradiction or implausibility in the sequence.

### Final Answer:
B: No

**Reasoning:**
The sequence described in the question is plausible and follows a logical progression of TTPs. However, the question asks if Infamous Chisel is **likely** to automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services **before** enumerating system data directories and GPS information. While the sequence is plausible, the specific behavior of automatically exfiltrating using Tor hidden services before performing discovery is not a common or guaranteed behavior for all attackers or tools. Therefore, it is not necessarily "likely" that Infamous Chisel would follow this exact sequence.
