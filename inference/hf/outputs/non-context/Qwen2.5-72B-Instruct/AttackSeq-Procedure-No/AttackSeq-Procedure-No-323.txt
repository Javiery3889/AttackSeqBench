### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by malware.
   - The malware uses a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the Command and Control (C2) server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase in MITRE ATT&CK:**
     - The Discovery phase is where the malware gathers information about the system and its environment to determine what actions to take next.
     - Common techniques in the Discovery phase include:
       - System Information Discovery
       - System Network Configuration Discovery
       - System Network Connections Discovery
       - System Owner/User Discovery
       - System Service Discovery
       - System Time Discovery
   - **Data Collection:**
     - Collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data is typically associated with the Collection phase, not the Discovery phase.
     - The Collection phase involves gathering data of interest to the adversary, which can include sensitive information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the C2 server is a technique used for Command and Control (C2) communication.
   - The Discovery phase is focused on gathering information about the system and its environment, not on collecting specific data like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - Collecting such specific data is more aligned with the Collection phase, which occurs after the Discovery phase.

### Final Answer: B: No
