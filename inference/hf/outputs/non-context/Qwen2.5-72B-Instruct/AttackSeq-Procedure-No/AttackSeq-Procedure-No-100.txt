### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Trickbot.
   - Trickbot is known for stealing credentials and information from various applications, including Filezilla and internet browsers.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that Trickbot will use fast flux DNS to mask its command and control (C2) channel behind rotating IP addresses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Trickbot's Capabilities:**
     - Trickbot is a sophisticated malware that has been known to use various techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection.
     - One of its common techniques is to steal credentials and information from applications, which aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Fast Flux DNS:**
     - Fast flux DNS is a technique used by malware to hide the location of C2 servers by rapidly changing the IP addresses associated with a domain.
     - This technique is often used to make it more difficult for security researchers and defenders to block or take down the C2 infrastructure.
   - **Trickbot's Use of Fast Flux DNS:**
     - Trickbot has been known to use various evasion techniques, including fast flux DNS, to maintain its C2 channels and avoid detection.
     - Using fast flux DNS would be a logical step for Trickbot to ensure that its C2 infrastructure remains robust and resilient against takedown efforts.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given Trickbot's known capabilities and the common use of fast flux DNS in sophisticated malware, it is likely that Trickbot would use fast flux DNS to mask its C2 channel.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
