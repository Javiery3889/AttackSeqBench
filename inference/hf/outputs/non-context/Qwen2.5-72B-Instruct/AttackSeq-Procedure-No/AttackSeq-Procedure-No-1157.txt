### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Impersonating technical support or friends.
     2. Delivering phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges.
     3. Locking out the original owners by changing account passwords.
     4. Using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is likely.
     - Let's evaluate the plausibility:
       - **Impersonation and Phishing:** Impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages is a common tactic used by attackers to gain initial access to accounts.
       - **Locking Out Original Owners:** Changing account passwords to lock out the original owners is a logical next step to maintain control over the compromised account.
       - **Using Phishing Sites:** Collecting additional credentials using phishing sites is a common follow-up action to gather more information and potentially compromise other accounts.
     - This sequence is consistent with typical attack patterns where attackers first gain access, secure control, and then expand their reach.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the sequence described is not likely.
     - Let's evaluate the plausibility:
       - If the attackers change the account passwords to lock out the original owners, they would have already gained control of the account.
       - However, using phishing sites to collect additional credentials after locking out the original owners seems redundant and less efficient.
       - Typically, attackers would use phishing sites to gain initial access, not after they have already secured control of the account.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is described in the question.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
