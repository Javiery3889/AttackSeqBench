### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin, after monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes, is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** Monitoring network traffic and sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.
   - **Subsequent TTPs:** Gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Monitoring Network Traffic and Sniffing Low-Level Network Traffic:**
     - These activities are typically part of the initial reconnaissance and collection phases of an attack. Regin, a sophisticated malware, is known for its advanced capabilities in network monitoring and data collection.
   - **Gathering Information on Processes and Memory Utilization:**
     - This is a common activity during the discovery phase, where the malware aims to understand the environment it has compromised. Regin is known to perform such activities to identify running processes, memory usage, and other system details.
   - **Scanning for Deleted Files:**
     - Scanning for deleted files is also a plausible activity during the discovery phase. It can help the attacker recover sensitive information that has been deleted but not yet overwritten.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - Given Regin's advanced capabilities and its known behavior, it is highly likely that after initial network monitoring and data collection, it would proceed to gather detailed information about the system, including processes, memory utilization, and deleted files.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
