### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.
     - Conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.
     - Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using Stolen Credentials to Maintain Persistent Access:**
     - This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks. Once an attacker gains access to a system, they often use stolen credentials to maintain persistent access, ensuring they can return to the system even if the initial entry point is closed.
   - **Conducting Vulnerability Scanning:**
     - After gaining persistent access, it is logical for an attacker to conduct vulnerability scanning to identify additional weaknesses in the network. This helps them understand the environment better and plan their next steps.
   - **Deploying Public Exploits:**
     - Deploying public exploits is a common follow-up action after identifying vulnerabilities. Public exploits are widely available and can be used to gain further access or escalate privileges.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
     1. **Initial Access and Persistence:** Using stolen credentials to maintain access.
     2. **Reconnaissance:** Conducting vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses.
     3. **Exploitation:** Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerabilities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, it is indeed likely that the group will deploy public exploits on identified vulnerable services only after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
