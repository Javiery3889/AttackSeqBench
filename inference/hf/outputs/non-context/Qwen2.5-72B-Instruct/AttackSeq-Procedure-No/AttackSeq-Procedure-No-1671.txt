### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers first conduct reconnaissance to gather various types of system information.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the Dark Seoul attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access only after completing the initial access phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The reconnaissance activities mentioned (gathering system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings) are typically performed to understand the target environment better.
     - These activities are usually conducted before the initial access phase to identify vulnerabilities and plan the attack.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - Initial access is the phase where the attackers gain a foothold in the target network.
     - Common methods for initial access include spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The question suggests that the reconnaissance phase was completed before the initial access phase.
     - It then asks if the attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access.
     - This implies that the initial access phase would follow the reconnaissance phase.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather information about the target system.
     2. **Initial Access:** The attackers use the gathered information to craft a spear-phishing email with a trojanized legitimate software installation executable to gain access.
   - The use of spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized executable is a common TTP for initial access, especially after reconnaissance has provided the necessary information to make the phishing attempt more convincing.
