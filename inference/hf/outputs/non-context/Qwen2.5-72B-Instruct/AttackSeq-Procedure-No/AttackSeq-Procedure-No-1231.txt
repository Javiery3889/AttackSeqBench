### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Lazarus group during a cyber attack on a bank.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
     - Disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.
     - Using backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers and execute remote commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with C2 servers and execute remote commands after deploying Hermes ransomware and disrupting operations.
     - This sequence is plausible because:
       - Deploying ransomware to delete backups and disrupt operations is a common initial step in a ransomware attack.
       - Using backdoor malware to maintain persistence and execute further commands is a common follow-up action to ensure continued control over the compromised network.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Lazarus group did not use backdoor malware to communicate with C2 servers and execute remote commands after the initial ransomware deployment and disruption.
     - This sequence is less plausible because:
       - It is unusual for an advanced threat actor like the Lazarus group to not maintain some form of persistent access to the compromised network.
       - Backdoor malware is a standard tool for maintaining control and executing further commands, which is crucial for a successful and prolonged attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with C2 servers and execute remote commands after deploying Hermes ransomware and disrupting operations.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
