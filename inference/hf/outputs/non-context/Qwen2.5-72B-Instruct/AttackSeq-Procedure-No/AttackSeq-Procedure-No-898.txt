### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Exfiltration of data** using the SmartFTP Client during the **Collection phase**.
     - A potential **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack** during the **Impact phase**.
     - **Deployment of RYUK ransomware** a week later.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - This is a common tactic in the **Collection** phase, where the attacker gathers sensitive information from the victim network.
   - **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack:**
     - A DDoS attack is typically used to overwhelm the victim's network resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is often used in the **Impact** phase to cause disruption.
   - **Deployment of RYUK Ransomware:**
     - RYUK ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom for their release. This is also an **Impact** phase tactic, but it is more focused on financial gain rather than disruption.

3. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - **Exfiltration of Data** followed by a **DDoS attack**:
       - While a DDoS attack can be used to distract or overwhelm the victim's network, it is not typically the primary goal after data exfiltration. The primary goal after exfiltration is often to maximize the value of the stolen data or to cover tracks.
     - **Exfiltration of Data** followed by **RYUK Ransomware**:
       - Deploying RYUK ransomware a week later is a more plausible sequence. After exfiltrating data, the attacker might use the ransomware to extort the victim for additional financial gain or to cover their tracks by encrypting the data and making it difficult to trace the exfiltration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical goals and tactics of cyber attackers, it is more plausible that the attacker would deploy RYUK ransomware a week later rather than launching a DDoS attack immediately after exfiltrating data.

### Final Answer: B: No
