### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT15:
     - **Mimikatz** to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     - **Stole a VPN certificate** to access the network remotely.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that APT15 used valid account information (such as the stolen VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that APT15 used the valid account information (stolen VPN credentials) to access the network remotely.
     - Given that APT15 already has the domain administrator credentials and a stolen VPN certificate, it is highly likely that they would use these valid credentials to maintain access to the network. This is a common tactic to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that APT15 did not use the valid account information and instead deployed backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - While deploying backdoors is also a common tactic, it is often used in conjunction with or as a fallback to using valid credentials. Given that APT15 already has valid credentials, it is less likely that they would immediately resort to deploying backdoors.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - APT15 has already obtained domain administrator credentials and a stolen VPN certificate, which are highly valuable for maintaining access to the network.
   - Using valid account information is a stealthier and more reliable method for maintaining access compared to deploying backdoors, which can be more easily detected.
   - Therefore, it is more plausible that APT15 would use the valid account information to access the network remotely.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
