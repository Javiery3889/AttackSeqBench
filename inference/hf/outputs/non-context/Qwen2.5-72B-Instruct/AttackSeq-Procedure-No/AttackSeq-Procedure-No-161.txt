### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence involves deploying tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping.
   - The technique used is DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will use the compromised Managed Service Provider (MSP) credentials to gain higher-level permissions such as domain administrator during privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Load Order Hijacking:** This technique involves placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
   - **Mimikatz and PwDump:** These tools are commonly used for credential dumping, which involves extracting credentials (such as passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets) from memory or the registry.
   - **APT10:** APT10 is a known advanced persistent threat group that has been associated with targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and using stolen credentials to gain deeper access within networks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This is a common goal for attackers, where they seek to gain higher-level permissions to perform more advanced actions within a network.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - APT10 is known for its sophisticated and targeted attacks, often involving the use of stolen credentials to move laterally within a network and gain higher-level permissions.
   - After successfully using tools like mimikatz or PwDump to dump credentials via DLL load order hijacking, it is highly likely that APT10 would use the compromised MSP credentials to escalate privileges.
   - MSPs often have elevated access to multiple systems and networks, making their credentials particularly valuable for privilege escalation.
   - The use of compromised MSP credentials to gain domain administrator permissions aligns with the typical behavior of APT10, which seeks to maintain long-term access and control over the target network.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
