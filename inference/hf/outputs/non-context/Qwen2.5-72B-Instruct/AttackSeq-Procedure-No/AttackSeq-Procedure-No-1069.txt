### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.
     2. Using the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`.
     3. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`**
     - This is a common technique used by various threat actors to maintain persistence and execute malicious code. Tropic Trooper has been known to use such techniques.
   - **Step 2: Using the FakeRun loader to launch `dllhost.exe`**
     - The FakeRun loader is a known tool used by Tropic Trooper to execute malicious payloads. It is often used to launch backdoors and other malicious components.
   - **Step 3: Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads**
     - Equation Editor exploits are a specific type of vulnerability that has been used by various threat groups, including Tropic Trooper, to deliver and execute malicious payloads. However, this step typically occurs before the backdoor is injected and the FakeRun loader is used.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the Equation Editor exploit is used to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, which would then lead to the injection of the malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe` and the use of the FakeRun loader to launch it.
   - However, the typical sequence of events for Tropic Trooper would be:
     1. Use an exploit (like Equation Editor) to deliver and execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
     2. The installer package would then inject the malicious DLL backdoor into `dllhost.exe`.
     3. The FakeRun loader would be used to launch `dllhost.exe` to execute the backdoor.

   - The question implies that the FakeRun loader is used to launch `dllhost.exe` only after the Equation Editor exploit has been used to execute the installer package. This is not the most plausible sequence because the FakeRun loader is typically used to launch the backdoor, which is injected after the initial exploit.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
