### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a spyware uses `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases for credentials as part of the Credential Access phase.
   - It then asks whether it is likely that the spyware would leverage C2 (Command and Control) servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities **only** before querying the databases.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access Phase:**
     - The use of `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases for credentials is a common technique used in the Credential Access phase of an attack. This is typically done to steal user credentials, which can be used for further activities.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The C2 phase involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data. This is usually done after gaining initial access and often after performing other activities like Credential Access.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The question suggests that the C2 activities would occur **only** before the Credential Access phase. This is unusual because typically, C2 activities are established to maintain control and facilitate further actions, including Credential Access.
     - It is more common for the C2 to be established after the initial access and possibly after the Credential Access phase, to ensure that the attacker can control the compromised system and exfiltrate the stolen credentials.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, it is unlikely that the spyware would leverage C2 servers hosted on Novinhost for Command and Control activities **only** before querying the databases. The more plausible sequence is that the C2 would be established after the Credential Access phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
