### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tropic Trooper threat group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.
     2. Dropping RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity.
     3. Injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate the attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Equation Editor Exploits:**
     - Equation Editor exploits are known to be used by various threat actors, including Tropic Trooper, to deliver malicious payloads.
   - **Dropping RegAsm.exe:**
     - RegAsm.exe is a legitimate Microsoft utility used to register .NET assemblies. However, it can be abused by threat actors to perform malicious activities, such as registering malicious .NET assemblies.
   - **Injecting a Malicious DLL Backdoor into dllhost.exe:**
     - Injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe is a common technique used to maintain persistence and execute malicious code in the context of a trusted process.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with known Tropic Trooper TTPs.
   - Tropic Trooper has been known to use Equation Editor exploits to deliver initial payloads.
   - Dropping RegAsm.exe to register malicious .NET assemblies is a logical next step to set up the environment for further malicious activities.
   - Injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe is a common technique to maintain persistence and execute the backdoor.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Yes
