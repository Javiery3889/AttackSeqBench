### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a threat actor named ProjectM.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defense measures (e.g., WHOIS protection for infrastructure).
     - Gaining initial access.
     - Delivering payloads through malicious RTF and Excel files that exploit known vulnerabilities.
     - Executing malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy.
     - Using RATs (Remote Access Trojans) such as DarkComet and Bozok.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely.
     - The sequence is logical and follows a common attack pattern:
       - **Evading Defense Measures:** Threat actors often use techniques like WHOIS protection to hide their infrastructure and avoid detection.
       - **Gaining Initial Access:** Malicious RTF and Excel files are common vectors for initial access, often exploiting known vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Office.
       - **Delivering Payloads:** Once initial access is gained, the threat actor can deliver and execute malicious code.
       - **Using Trojans and RATs:** Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, and RATs like DarkComet and Bozok, are often used to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely.
     - However, the sequence described is a well-documented and plausible attack pattern used by many threat actors.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of TTPs and the common practices of threat actors, the most plausible answer is that the described sequence is likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
