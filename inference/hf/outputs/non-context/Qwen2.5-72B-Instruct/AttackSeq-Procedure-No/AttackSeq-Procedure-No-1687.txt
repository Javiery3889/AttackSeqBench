### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Phantom Menace attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Uploading credentials to an external FTP server.
     2. Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.
     3. Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Step 1: Uploading credentials to an external FTP server.**
     - This is a common exfiltration technique where attackers send stolen data to a server they control.
   - **Step 2: Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.**
     - Persistence is a crucial step in maintaining access to a compromised system. Running batch files periodically is a method to ensure that the attacker's tools or scripts are executed regularly.
   - **Step 3: Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.**
     - Collecting credentials from password stores is a common technique for credential access. However, this step is typically performed earlier in the attack lifecycle to gather initial credentials, which are then used for further actions.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers first exfiltrate credentials, then set up persistence, and only then use legitimate applications to collect more credentials.
   - This sequence is less plausible because:
     - **Credential Collection:** Attackers typically collect credentials early in the attack to gain initial access and move laterally. It is unusual to set up persistence and then return to collect credentials.
     - **Persistence Setup:** Setting up persistence is usually done after gaining initial access and ensuring that the attacker can maintain control over the system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sequence described in the question is not the most plausible. It is more likely that the attackers would collect credentials first, use them to gain access and set up persistence, and then continue to collect more credentials as needed.

### Final Answer: B: No
