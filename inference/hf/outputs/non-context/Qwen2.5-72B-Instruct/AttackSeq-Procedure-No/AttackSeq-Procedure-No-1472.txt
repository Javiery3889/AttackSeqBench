### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where adversaries use a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT (Remote Access Trojan) to target systems.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Phishing Campaign:**
     - Phishing is a common initial access technique where adversaries send emails with malicious attachments or links to trick users into executing malware.
   - **Delivery of BlackEnergy 3 RAT:**
     - Once the user clicks on the malicious link or attachment, the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is delivered to the target system.
   - **Establishing C2 Connection:**
     - After the RAT is delivered and executed, the next step is typically to establish a C2 connection to allow the adversaries to control the compromised system remotely.
   - **Clicking on Malicious Hyperlinks:**
     - The question specifically asks if the C2 connection is established through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders.
     - While the initial access might involve clicking on a malicious link, the C2 connection is usually established by the RAT itself, not by the user clicking on another link.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The initial phishing email is used to deliver the RAT, and once the RAT is executed, it establishes the C2 connection automatically.
   - The user's action of clicking on a malicious link is part of the initial access phase, not the C2 establishment phase.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the C2 connection is established through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders after the RAT is already delivered and executed.

### Final Answer: B: No
