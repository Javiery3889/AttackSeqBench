### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the StellarParticle campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
     - Accessing data from Information Repositories.
     - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets are commonly used for reconnaissance to gather information about the network and Active Directory structure. This is a typical initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - **Accessing Data from Information Repositories:**
     - After gathering information about the network, threat actors often access data from information repositories (e.g., file servers, databases) to exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is a common next step after gaining initial access and gathering information. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a popular method for lateral movement.
     - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP is a plausible strategy. Privileged accounts can provide broader access, while non-privileged accounts can be used to maintain a low profile and avoid detection.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance:**
     - The use of AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets for discovery activities is a logical first step to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **Data Access:**
     - Once the threat actor has a map of the network and identified valuable information repositories, they would likely access these repositories to gather sensitive data.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After accessing the data, the threat actor would need to move laterally to other systems to maintain persistence and potentially exfiltrate the data.
     - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP is a strategic approach to balance access and stealth.
