### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C (Command and Control) server.
     - Communicating over HTTPS.
     - Using multi-byte XOR keys for encryption.
     - Exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Using SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server:**
     - SparrowDoor is a known backdoor used by FamousSparrow to establish and maintain communication with the C&C server.
   - **Communicating over HTTPS:**
     - HTTPS is a common protocol used to encrypt communications, making it difficult for network defenders to detect or intercept the traffic.
   - **Using multi-byte XOR keys for encryption:**
     - Multi-byte XOR keys are a method of encryption that can be used to obfuscate data and commands, adding an additional layer of security to the communication.
   - **Exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method:**
     - Scheduled data exfiltration is a common technique used by threat actors to ensure that data is consistently and reliably transferred to the C2 server. However, the specific interval (every 10 minutes) is not a standard or commonly reported behavior for FamousSparrow.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - FamousSparrow is known for using SparrowDoor and HTTPS for communication, and employing encryption techniques like multi-byte XOR keys.
   - However, the specific detail of exfiltrating data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method is not a well-documented or typical behavior for FamousSparrow. While it is possible, it is less likely to be a standard part of their TTPs.
