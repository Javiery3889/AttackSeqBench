### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
   - The sequence includes deploying additional modules (like pr.dll) to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
   - The question then asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Deployment of Additional Modules:**
     - Deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server is a common tactic used by APT groups to exfiltrate data.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The discovery phase typically involves identifying the network topology, system configurations, and potential vulnerabilities within the target environment.
     - Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems is a part of the discovery phase.
   - **Timing of Discovery:**
     - APT groups often perform discovery early in the attack lifecycle to understand the target environment and plan subsequent actions.
     - Performing discovery only after deploying additional modules for data exfiltration is less common and less strategic.
   - **Geographically Distributed Bots:**
     - Using geographically distributed bots for scanning can help in evading detection and can be a part of the discovery phase.
     - However, this is typically done during the initial stages of the attack to gather as much information as possible before moving to data exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical attack lifecycle and the strategic importance of early discovery, it is less likely that APT28 would perform discovery only after deploying additional modules for data exfiltration.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that APT28 is not likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward.

**Final Answer: B: No**
