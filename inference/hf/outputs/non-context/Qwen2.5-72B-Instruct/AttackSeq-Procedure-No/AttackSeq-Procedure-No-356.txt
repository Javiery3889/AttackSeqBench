### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by an attacker (Suckfly) within a corporate internal network.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Scanning the network for hosts with open ports 8080, 5900, and 40.
     2. Identifying potential expansion points.
     3. Gathering unsecured credentials for Azure AD services, such as Azure AD Connect, from a local machine.
     4. Using hacktools to move laterally within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Scanning for Open Ports:**
     - Scanning for open ports is a common initial step in network reconnaissance to identify potential targets. Ports 8080, 5900, and 40 are often associated with web services, remote desktop, and other network services, respectively.
   - **Identifying Potential Expansion Points:**
     - Once the attacker identifies hosts with open ports, they can target these hosts for further exploitation.
   - **Gathering Unsecured Credentials:**
     - Gathering unsecured credentials is a logical next step after identifying potential targets. Azure AD Connect is a tool that synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. If the attacker can access a local machine with unsecured credentials, they can potentially gain access to Azure AD services.
   - **Using Hacktools to Move Laterally:**
     - Once the attacker has gathered credentials, they can use various tools to move laterally within the network, gaining access to other systems and resources.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of an attack:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Scanning for Open Ports):** The attacker scans the network to identify potential targets.
     2. **Exploitation (Identifying Expansion Points):** The attacker selects targets based on the open ports.
     3. **Credential Access (Gathering Unsecured Credentials):** The attacker attempts to gather credentials from a local machine, which could include Azure AD Connect credentials.
     4. **Lateral Movement (Using Hacktools):** The attacker uses the gathered credentials to move laterally within the network.

   - Each step in the sequence is a common and logical progression in a cyber attack, making the sequence plausible.
