### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Lateral Movement** through network projection within the internal network.
     - The question asks if it is likely that APT-TOCS will use **removable media** for command and control (C2) operations after lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement through Network Projection:**
     - Network projection typically involves techniques such as port forwarding, tunneling, or other methods to extend network access and move laterally within a network.
     - This is a common tactic used by APTs to spread within a network and gain access to additional systems.

   - **Command and Control (C2) Operations:**
     - C2 operations involve the attacker maintaining control over compromised systems and receiving commands from a remote server.
     - Common C2 methods include:
       - **Network-based C2:** Using standard network protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.).
       - **Custom Protocols:** Using custom or encrypted protocols.
       - **Removable Media:** Using USB drives or other removable storage devices to exfiltrate data or receive commands.

   - **Likelihood of Using Removable Media for C2:**
     - While removable media can be used for C2, it is generally less common and more cumbersome compared to network-based C2.
     - Network-based C2 is more efficient and allows for real-time communication and control.
     - Removable media is more likely to be used for data exfiltration or initial infection vectors, but not typically for ongoing C2 operations.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the typical use cases and efficiency of network-based C2, it is less likely that APT-TOCS would use removable media for C2 operations after lateral movement through network projection.

**Final Answer: B: No**
