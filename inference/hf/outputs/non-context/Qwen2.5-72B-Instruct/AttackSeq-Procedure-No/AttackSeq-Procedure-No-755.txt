### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control (C2) purposes.
     2. Performing initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that after establishing C2 communication, the Rising Sun implant would perform initial reconnaissance.
     - This is a plausible sequence because once a malware establishes C2 communication, it often performs reconnaissance to gather information about the compromised system and network. This information can be used to further the attack, such as identifying valuable targets or understanding the environment to avoid detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the Rising Sun implant would not perform initial reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication.
     - This is less plausible because initial reconnaissance is a common next step after establishing C2 communication. Malware often needs to gather information about the environment to plan subsequent actions.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the typical behavior of malware and the logical sequence of actions, the most plausible answer is that the Rising Sun implant would perform initial reconnaissance after establishing C2 communication.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
