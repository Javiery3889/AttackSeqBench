### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - The PRB-Backdoor communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server via the domain `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`.
     - The execution of PowerShell scripts triggered by a macro in a Word document.
     - The use of obfuscated macro scripts for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the sequence described is plausible.
     - In a typical attack sequence, the backdoor might communicate with the C&C server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
     - After establishing communication, the attacker might then execute additional payloads, such as PowerShell scripts, which can be triggered by macros in a Word document.
     - Obfuscation of macros is a common technique used to evade detection by security software.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the sequence described is not plausible.
     - If the backdoor has already communicated with the C&C server, it is less likely that the attack would then rely on a macro in a Word document to execute PowerShell scripts, as the backdoor itself could be used to execute commands directly.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Communication with C&C:**
     - The PRB-Backdoor communicating with the C&C server is a common initial step in many attack sequences. This allows the attacker to establish a foothold and receive further instructions.
   - **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
     - Executing PowerShell scripts is a common technique used by attackers to perform various malicious activities, such as downloading additional payloads, executing commands, or exfiltrating data.
   - **Triggering via Macro:**
     - Macros in Word documents are often used as an initial infection vector to execute malicious code. However, if the backdoor has already established communication with the C&C server, it is less likely that the attack would rely on a macro to trigger further actions.
   - **Obfuscation:**
     - Obfuscation of macros is a common technique to evade detection by security software, making it more likely that the macro would be used in the initial stages of the attack.

### Conclusion
Given the typical sequence of TTPs in a cyber attack, it is more plausible that the macro in the Word document would be used to execute the PowerShell scripts and establish the initial communication with the C&C server, rather than the backdoor communicating with the C&C server first and then using the macro to execute PowerShell scripts.

**Final Answer: B: No**
