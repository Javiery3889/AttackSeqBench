### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by adversaries.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Abusing PowerShell for the execution of the Empire stager.
     2. Concealing execution of malicious payloads through reflective code loading.
     3. Establishing persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects (CLSID: D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **PowerShell for Empire Stager Execution:**
     - PowerShell is a common tool used by adversaries for initial access and execution of stagers like Empire. This is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Execution" tactic.
   - **Reflective Code Loading:**
     - Reflective code loading is a technique used to load and execute malicious code in memory without writing it to disk. This is often used to evade detection and is part of the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - **Persistence via COM Object Hijacking:**
     - Hijacking COM objects is a method to achieve persistence by modifying the registry to execute malicious code when certain system events occur. This is part of the "Persistence" tactic.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - Using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager is a common initial step in many attack scenarios. This aligns with the "Execution" tactic.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - After gaining initial access, adversaries often use techniques like reflective code loading to avoid detection. This aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Establishing persistence is a critical step for maintaining long-term access to the target system. Hijacking COM objects is a sophisticated method to achieve this, aligning with the "Persistence" tactic.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The sequence described in the question is a logical and plausible sequence of TTPs. It follows a common attack pattern where initial access is gained, followed by defense evasion, and then persistence is established.
