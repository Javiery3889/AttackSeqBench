### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Credential Access:**
       - Using Procdump and Mimikatz to extract credentials.
       - Employing 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
     - **Lateral Movement:**
       - The question asks if PDQ Deploy is likely to be used to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Procdump and Mimikatz are well-known tools for extracting credentials from memory.
     - 'Invoke the Hash' is a technique used to perform pass-the-hash attacks, which allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote system using a hashed password instead of a plaintext password.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that can be used to push software and scripts across a network.
     - AvosLocker is a type of ransomware.
     - Using a legitimate tool like PDQ Deploy to move malware and tools across a network is a common technique in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The Fox Kitten Campaign is known for using sophisticated techniques to maintain persistence and move laterally within a network.
   - The use of Procdump and Mimikatz for credential access and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks indicates a high level of sophistication.
   - Given the sophistication of the campaign, it is plausible that they would use a legitimate tool like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement.
   - This approach aligns with the principle of using legitimate tools to blend in with normal network traffic and avoid detection by security systems.
