### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Comfoo Remote Access Tool (RAT) is used to collect system and network information through various capabilities such as keystroke logging, screenshots, and file management.
   - The question then asks whether it is likely that the Comfoo Command and Control (C2) server will use compromised residential endpoints within the same ISP IP address range as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Using compromised residential endpoints as proxies is a common tactic in cyber attacks to obfuscate the true source of C2 traffic. This technique, known as "proxy hopping" or "pivot points," helps attackers evade detection and attribution.
     - Residential endpoints within the same ISP IP address range can be particularly useful because they can blend in with normal traffic and make it harder for defenders to identify malicious activity.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This answer suggests that the Comfoo C2 server would not use such a technique. However, this is less likely given the sophisticated nature of Comfoo and the common use of proxy hopping in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated capabilities of the Comfoo RAT and the common practice of using proxy hopping to hide the true source of C2 traffic, it is highly likely that the Comfoo C2 server would use compromised residential endpoints within the same ISP IP address range as proxies.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
