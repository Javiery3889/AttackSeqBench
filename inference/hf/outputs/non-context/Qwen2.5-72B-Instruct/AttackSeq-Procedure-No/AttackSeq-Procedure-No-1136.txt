### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the WINDSHIFT APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information.
     - Employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after the initial reconnaissance activities, WINDSHIFT APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development.
     - This is plausible because:
       - The initial reconnaissance activities (gathering identifiable information and stealing contact lists, emails, and SMS contents) provide a wealth of data that can be used to identify and target specific individuals or organizations.
       - Accessing external victim-owned websites is a logical next step in the attack sequence to gather more detailed information about the targets, such as their online activities, business operations, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that WINDSHIFT APT will not access external victim-owned websites for target development.
     - This is less plausible because:
       - The initial reconnaissance activities are designed to gather as much information as possible to facilitate further targeting.
       - Not accessing external victim-owned websites would limit the amount of information available for target development, which is a critical step in many APT campaigns.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical progression of the attack sequence and the typical behavior of APT groups, it is more likely that WINDSHIFT APT will access external victim-owned websites for target development after the initial reconnaissance activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
