### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor group FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting data from network shared drives.
     - Archiving the data for fraudulent transactions.
     - Using steganography to hide C2 (Command and Control) communications.
     - Exfiltrating the data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Steganography:**
     - Steganography is a technique used to hide data within other files or data streams. It is often used to avoid detection by blending in with normal network traffic.
     - While steganography can be used to hide C2 communications, it is not a common technique for exfiltration, especially when web shells and JSP tools are available.
   - **Web Shells and JSP Tools:**
     - Web shells and JSP tools are commonly used for exfiltration because they can be easily integrated into web applications and can blend in with normal web traffic.
     - These tools are often used to establish a persistent backdoor and to exfiltrate data over web services.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that FIN13 is already using web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration, it is less likely that they would use steganography to hide C2 communications. Web shells and JSP tools are sufficient for both C2 and exfiltration, and they are more straightforward to implement and maintain.
   - Steganography adds an additional layer of complexity and is typically used when the threat actor needs to avoid detection in a highly monitored environment. However, the use of web shells and JSP tools already provides a high level of stealth and functionality.

### Final Answer:
B: No
