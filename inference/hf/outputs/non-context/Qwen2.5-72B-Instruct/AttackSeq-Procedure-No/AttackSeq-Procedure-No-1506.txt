### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the RIG Exploit Kit (EK).
   - The sequence involves using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and then potentially using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic for command and control (C2) operations.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Domain fronting is a technique where an attacker uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to mask the true destination of network traffic. This can make it harder for network defenders to detect and block malicious traffic.
     - Using proxy servers to make infections harder to detect aligns with the goal of evading detection. Domain fronting is another layer of obfuscation that can further enhance this goal.
     - RIG EK is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. Domain fronting is a plausible next step in this sequence.

   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that RIG EK would not use domain fronting after using proxy servers.
     - While it is possible that RIG EK might not use domain fronting, it is less likely given the context of the question. The use of proxy servers indicates a focus on evading detection, and domain fronting is a logical extension of this strategy.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context and the logical progression of TTPs, the most plausible sequence is that RIG EK would use domain fronting to further disguise the destination of network traffic after using proxy servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
