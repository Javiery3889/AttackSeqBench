### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for the Seaduke malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with a C&C server.
     - Remaining under the attackers' control via HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.
     - Retrieving detailed bot/system information.
     - Securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is likely for Seaduke.
     - Seaduke is known for its sophisticated communication with C&C servers and its ability to remain under the attackers' control using HTTP/HTTPS with layered encoding and encryption.
     - Seaduke has been observed to gather detailed system information, which is a common tactic for malware to understand the environment it is operating in.
     - The 'seppuku' function, which refers to the malware's ability to securely delete itself, is a known feature of Seaduke to avoid detection and forensic analysis.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the described sequence of TTPs is not likely for Seaduke.
     - However, the TTPs described are consistent with the known behavior of Seaduke, as outlined in various CTI reports and analyses.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question is consistent with the known behavior of Seaduke malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Seaduke will indeed utilize these TTPs.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
