### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that starts with reconnaissance activities.
   - It then mentions the use of BlackEnergy 3, a known malware.
   - The question asks if it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed through employee-enabled macro execution.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Activities:**
     - Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods are common initial steps in many cyber attacks. This aligns with the initial phase of the attack.
   - **BlackEnergy 3:**
     - BlackEnergy 3 is a sophisticated malware known for its use in targeted attacks, particularly in industrial and critical infrastructure sectors.
   - **Employee-Enabled Macro Execution:**
     - Malware like BlackEnergy 3 often uses social engineering techniques to trick employees into enabling macros in documents, which can then execute the malware.
   - **Ruby Scripts:**
     - While BlackEnergy 3 is known to use various scripting languages and techniques to execute payloads, it is not particularly known for using Ruby scripts. BlackEnergy 3 typically uses more common scripting languages like PowerShell or VBScript, which are more prevalent in Windows environments.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given that BlackEnergy 3 is more commonly associated with PowerShell or VBScript for payload execution, it is less likely that it would use Ruby scripts in this context.

### Final Answer:
B: No
