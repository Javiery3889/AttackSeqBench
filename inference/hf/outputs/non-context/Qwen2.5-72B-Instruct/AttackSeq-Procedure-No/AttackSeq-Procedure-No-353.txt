### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence involves:
     - A downloader retrieving an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.
     - This retrieval occurs during the command and control (C2) phase.
     - The question then asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:**
     - The downloader retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware. This is a common technique where malware is hidden within seemingly benign files to evade detection.
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The question asks if PowerShell scripts will then download a Windows executable and a decoy document.
     - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers for various purposes, including downloading additional payloads and executing them.
     - Downloading a Windows executable is a common next step after initial infection to deploy the main malware payload.
     - A decoy document is often used to maintain the appearance of normalcy and to avoid arousing suspicion from the user.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible and aligns with common attack patterns:
     - **Initial Infection:** The downloader retrieves the encoded malware.
     - **C2 Communication:** The malware establishes communication with the C2 server.
     - **Execution:** The malware uses PowerShell to download additional components, such as a Windows executable and a decoy document.
   - This sequence is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where:
     - **T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer):** The malware downloads additional tools or payloads.
     - **T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter):** PowerShell is used to execute scripts and commands.
     - **T1204 (User Execution):** The decoy document is used to trick the user into executing the malware.

### Final Answer:
A: Yes
