### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Higaisa APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Maintaining persistence by copying `svchhast.exe` to the startup directory.
     - Adding `officeupdate.exe` to scheduled tasks.
     - Executing multiple commands leveraging `gosia.exe` to bypass detection.
     - Distributing malicious LNK files disguised as Curriculum Vitae and IELTS exam results for initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions distributing malicious LNK files disguised as Curriculum Vitae and IELTS exam results for initial access. This is a common technique used by APT groups to gain initial access to a target system.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question describes maintaining persistence by copying `svchhast.exe` to the startup directory and adding `officeupdate.exe` to scheduled tasks. These are typical persistence mechanisms used by APT groups to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system over time.
   - **Bypassing Detection:**
     - The question mentions executing multiple commands leveraging `gosia.exe` to bypass detection. This is a plausible step that an APT group would take to avoid being detected by security systems.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question follows a logical progression of an APT attack:
     1. **Initial Access:** The APT group gains initial access by distributing malicious LNK files.
     2. **Persistence:** Once access is gained, the APT group ensures they can maintain access by using persistence mechanisms.
     3. **Bypassing Detection:** After establishing persistence, the APT group would likely take steps to avoid detection, such as executing commands through a less suspicious executable like `gosia.exe`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of TTPs described, the answer is that the Higaisa APT group is likely to execute multiple commands leveraging `gosia.exe` to bypass detection only after distributing malicious LNK files for initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
