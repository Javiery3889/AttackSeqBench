### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor "Yellow Garuda."
   - The actions include collecting various types of data (messages, media, group memberships, and contact data) from victims' Telegram accounts using a 'grabber' tool.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that these data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Dividing data into fixed-size chunks is a common technique used to evade detection. This method can help in several ways:
       - **Bandwidth Management:** Smaller chunks can be sent more frequently, making it harder to detect large data transfers.
       - **Evasion of Network Monitoring:** Smaller, more frequent transfers can blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder for network monitoring tools to flag the activity.
       - **Data Obfuscation:** Smaller chunks can be encrypted or encoded differently, making it harder to identify the nature of the data being exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the data is not divided into fixed-size chunks, it is more likely to be exfiltrated in larger, more noticeable chunks. This can increase the risk of detection by network monitoring tools and security systems.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack described (using a 'grabber' tool to collect specific data from Telegram accounts), it is reasonable to assume that the threat actor would employ techniques to evade detection.
   - Dividing data into fixed-size chunks is a well-known and effective method for evading detection, making it a plausible step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
