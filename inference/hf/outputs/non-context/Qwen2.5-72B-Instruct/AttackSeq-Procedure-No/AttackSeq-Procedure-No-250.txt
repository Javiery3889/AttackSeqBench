### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that are allegedly used by the NanHaiShu group.
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Establishing persistence by adding a `.desktop` configuration file to the user's `~/.config/autostart` directory.
     2. Decoding and executing JScript data by writing it to `'%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js'` and executing it.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence via `.desktop` file:**
     - The `.desktop` file in the `~/.config/autostart` directory is a common method for establishing persistence on Linux systems. This file can be used to run a script or program automatically when the user logs in.
   - **Decoding and executing JScript:**
     - Writing and executing JScript data to `'%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js'` is a common technique used on Windows systems to execute malicious code. The `%appdata%` directory is a common location for storing application data and can be used to hide malicious files.
   - **Cross-Platform Consideration:**
     - The first step (adding a `.desktop` file) is specific to Linux, while the second step (writing to `%appdata%`) is specific to Windows. It is unusual for a single attack sequence to involve both Linux and Windows-specific techniques without a clear transition or context.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the cross-platform nature of the described sequence, it is unlikely that NanHaiShu would use both techniques in the same attack sequence without a clear reason or context. Typically, an attack would focus on a single platform or have a clear mechanism for transitioning between platforms.

### Final Answer:
B: No
