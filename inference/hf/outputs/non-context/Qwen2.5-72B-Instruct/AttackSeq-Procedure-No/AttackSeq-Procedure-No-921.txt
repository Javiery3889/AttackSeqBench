### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents.
     - Searching for sensitive documents.
     - Lateral movement via compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that after injecting malicious macros, the malware will search for sensitive documents before moving laterally.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the malware will not search for sensitive documents before moving laterally.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Injection of Malicious Macros:**
     - Injecting malicious macros into documents is a common initial infection vector. This step is typically used to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Searching for Sensitive Documents:**
     - Searching for sensitive documents is a common post-compromise activity. It is often done to gather intelligence and exfiltrate valuable data.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement is the process of moving from one system to another within a network. This is typically done to spread the infection and gain access to more systems.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The typical sequence of actions for an advanced threat actor like Gamaredon would be:
       1. **Initial Infection:** Inject malicious macros into documents to gain initial access.
       2. **Post-Compromise Activities:** Search for sensitive documents to gather intelligence.
       3. **Lateral Movement:** Move to other systems to spread the infection and gain deeper access.

   - **Plausibility:**
     - It is plausible that after gaining initial access through malicious macros, the malware would search for sensitive documents to gather intelligence before moving laterally. This is a common and logical sequence of actions for an advanced threat actor.

### Final Answer
