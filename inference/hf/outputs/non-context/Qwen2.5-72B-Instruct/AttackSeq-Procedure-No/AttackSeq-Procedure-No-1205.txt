### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario involving the SolarWinds compromise and the delivery of the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack.
   - It asks whether the Sunburst backdoor is likely to communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sunburst backdoor is delivered through a supply-chain attack, which is a method of gaining initial access to a target network.
   - **C2 Communication:** The backdoor communicates with a C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server only before the initial access is achieved.
     - This is not plausible because the backdoor's primary function is to maintain persistence and communicate with the C2 server after the initial access is achieved.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This suggests that the Sunburst backdoor would not communicate with its C2 server only before the initial access is achieved.
     - This is plausible because the backdoor is designed to communicate with the C2 server after it has been installed on the target network, which is after the initial access is achieved.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Sunburst backdoor communicates with its C2 server after the initial access is achieved, not before.

**Final Answer: B: No**
