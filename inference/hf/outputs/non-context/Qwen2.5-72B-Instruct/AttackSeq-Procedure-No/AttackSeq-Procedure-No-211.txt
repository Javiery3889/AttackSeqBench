### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that an attacker, specifically Deep Panda, might use after gaining initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability.
     2. Ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
     3. Creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2`.
     4. Executing PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploiting the Log4Shell Vulnerability:**
     - This is a common initial access technique. The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Log4j, which can be exploited to gain initial access to a system.
   - **Ensuring Persistence:**
     - Copying a backdoor to a specific location in the `%APPDATA%` directory and creating a registry-based service are common persistence techniques. These steps ensure that the attacker can maintain access to the system even if the initial entry point is closed.
   - **Executing PowerShell Scripts and Batch Files:**
     - These are often used to perform various tasks, such as downloading and running additional files, which can include further malware, tools, or commands to maintain control or exfiltrate data.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with the typical behavior of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Deep Panda. They often use a combination of initial access, persistence, and execution techniques to maintain control over a compromised system.
   - The specific steps of copying a backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2` are plausible methods for ensuring persistence.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts and batch files to download and run additional files is a common follow-up action to maintain and expand the attacker's presence on the system.
