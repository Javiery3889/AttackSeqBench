### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the ProjectM actors.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Initial access via exploiting vulnerabilities in malicious RTF and Excel files.
     - Utilizing OpenSSL to encrypt C2 (Command and Control) traffic.
     - Delivering payloads using the Andromeda Trojan.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - ProjectM actors often use malicious RTF and Excel files to gain initial access. This is a common technique for delivering malware via phishing emails or other social engineering methods.
   - **C2 Traffic Encryption:**
     - Once initial access is gained, it is common for attackers to secure their C2 communications to avoid detection. OpenSSL is a widely used tool for encrypting traffic, making it a plausible choice for this purpose.
   - **Payload Delivery:**
     - The Andromeda Trojan (also known as Gamarue) is a well-known malware that can be used to deliver additional payloads from C2 servers. It is often used in multi-stage attacks where the initial access is followed by the delivery of more sophisticated malware.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logically consistent with typical attack patterns:
     - **Initial Access:** Malicious RTF and Excel files are used to gain a foothold in the target network.
     - **C2 Traffic Encryption:** Once the initial access is established, the attackers use OpenSSL to encrypt their C2 communications to maintain stealth.
     - **Payload Delivery:** The Andromeda Trojan is then used to deliver additional payloads from the C2 servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence and the common practices in cyber attacks, it is likely that ProjectM actors would utilize OpenSSL to encrypt C2 traffic before the Andromeda Trojan delivers payloads from these servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
