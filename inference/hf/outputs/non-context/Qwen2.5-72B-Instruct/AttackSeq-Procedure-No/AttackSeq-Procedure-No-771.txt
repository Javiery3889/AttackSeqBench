### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where Tortoiseshell gains initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from a specific website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com).
   - It then asks whether it is likely that Tortoiseshell created the website specifically to conduct reconnaissance campaigns and host malware downloaders only after executing a reconnaissance tool called 'bird.exe' to perform discovery.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com. This suggests that the website was already in place and was used to distribute the fake app.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The question mentions the use of a reconnaissance tool called 'bird.exe' to perform discovery. This tool is typically used to gather information about the target environment after gaining initial access.
   - **Website Purpose:**
     - The question asks if the website was created specifically to conduct reconnaissance campaigns and host malware downloaders only after executing 'bird.exe'.
     - If the website was created specifically for these purposes, it would imply that the website was not used for initial access but rather as a follow-up step after reconnaissance.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the website was already in place to distribute the fake app, which is the initial access vector.
   - The use of 'bird.exe' for reconnaissance is a subsequent step after gaining initial access.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the website was created specifically to conduct reconnaissance campaigns and host malware downloaders only after executing 'bird.exe'. The website was likely created to facilitate the initial access by distributing the fake app.
