### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker using Cobalt Strike.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Profiling the computer using commands like `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` during the discovery phase.
     - Employing lateral movement through commands and process injection on remote computers.
     - Emptying log files to conceal the attackers' activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The commands `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` are used to gather information about the current user, user accounts, and groups on the system. This is a common step in the discovery phase to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This can be achieved through various techniques, including using commands and process injection on remote computers.
   - **Log Clearing:**
     - Clearing log files is a technique used to remove traces of the attacker's activities, which can help in avoiding detection and forensic analysis.

3. **Sequence Analysis:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that log files will be emptied only after lateral movement has been employed.
   - In a typical attack sequence, an attacker might:
     1. Perform discovery to understand the environment.
     2. Use the information gathered to perform lateral movement.
     3. After gaining access to additional systems, the attacker might then clear logs to cover their tracks.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - It is plausible that an attacker would clear log files after performing lateral movement, as this would help in concealing their activities on multiple systems.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that log files will be emptied **only** after lateral movement, which implies that log clearing would not occur before lateral movement.

### Final Answer: B: No

The sequence described in the question is plausible, but it is not necessarily the only sequence. Log clearing can occur at various stages of an attack, and it is not strictly limited to occurring only after lateral movement. Therefore, the answer is "No."
