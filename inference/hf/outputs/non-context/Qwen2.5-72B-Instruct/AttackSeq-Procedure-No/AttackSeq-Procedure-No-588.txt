### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gholee malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Execution of a concatenated PE file named `NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll` using `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32`.
     - Clearing mailbox data to evade detection.
     - Establishing a secure command-and-control (C2) connection using an expired digital certificate.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution of the PE File:**
     - The use of `cmd.exe /C` and `Rundll32` to execute a PE file is a common technique for malware to run in memory and avoid detection.
   - **Clearing Mailbox Data:**
     - Clearing mailbox data is a technique used to remove traces of the malware's activity, which can help evade detection by security tools and forensic analysis.
   - **Establishing a C2 Connection:**
     - Establishing a C2 connection is a critical step for malware to communicate with the attacker's server and receive further instructions.
     - Using an expired digital certificate for a secure connection is less common but not unheard of. Malware might use expired certificates to avoid raising immediate suspicion or to leverage existing infrastructure.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is plausible. Malware often performs actions to evade detection before establishing a C2 connection.
   - Clearing mailbox data is a logical step to remove evidence of the malware's presence and activity.
   - Using an expired digital certificate for a C2 connection, while not ideal, is still a possible tactic to avoid immediate detection by security systems that might flag a completely invalid certificate.
