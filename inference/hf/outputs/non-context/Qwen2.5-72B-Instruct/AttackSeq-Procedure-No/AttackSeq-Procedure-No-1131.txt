### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where CVE-2015-5119 is exploited to execute a first stage downloader.
   - The malware then connects to several C2 domains, starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` only before retrieving the second stage PlugX file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **CVE-2015-5119**: This is a known vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that has been exploited by various malware, including Sakula.
   - **First Stage Downloader**: This is typically a small piece of malware that downloads and executes additional malware components.
   - **C2 Domains**: Command and Control (C2) domains are used by malware to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.
   - **Sakula Malware**: Sakula is a multi-stage malware that often uses a first stage downloader to fetch a second stage payload, such as PlugX.
   - **PlugX**: PlugX is a sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that is often used as a second stage payload in multi-stage attacks.

3. **Evaluate the Sequence:**
   - **Initial Exploit and Downloader**: The exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 to execute a first stage downloader is a common initial step in many malware attacks.
   - **C2 Communication**: The malware connecting to C2 domains like `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com` is typical behavior for establishing a command and control channel.
   - **Second Stage Payload**: The retrieval of a second stage payload, such as PlugX, is a common next step in multi-stage attacks.

4. **Specific Domains:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` only before retrieving the second stage PlugX file.
   - In a typical multi-stage attack, the malware might communicate with multiple C2 domains, not just a specific set of domains. The sequence of C2 communications can vary, and it is not common for malware to limit its communication to only a few specific domains before retrieving the second stage payload.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the typical behavior of multi-stage malware like Sakula, it is unlikely that the malware would communicate with only `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` before retrieving the second stage PlugX file. The malware is more likely to communicate with multiple C2 domains as part of its normal operation.

### Final Answer: B: No
