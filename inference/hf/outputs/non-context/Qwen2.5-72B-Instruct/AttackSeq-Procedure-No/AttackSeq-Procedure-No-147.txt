### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Establishing command and control (C2) by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.
     2. Using NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality.
     3. Accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials.
     4. Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Establishing C2 and Backdoor Functionality:**
     - Deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process is a common technique to establish a backdoor. This allows the attacker to maintain persistent access to the web server.
     - NodeIISWeb is a web shell that can be used to provide backdoor functionality, allowing the attacker to execute commands and maintain control over the compromised server.
   - **Accessing Shared Folders and Lateral Movement:**
     - Once the attacker has established a backdoor, it is logical for them to use compromised domain credentials to access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB. This is a common technique for lateral movement within a network.
     - Dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB is a plausible next step to extend the attacker's presence and control over other internal servers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is logical and aligns with common TTPs used by advanced threat actors. Establishing C2 and backdoor functionality is typically followed by lateral movement and further compromise of internal resources.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the sequence of TTPs described is likely to have occurred.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
