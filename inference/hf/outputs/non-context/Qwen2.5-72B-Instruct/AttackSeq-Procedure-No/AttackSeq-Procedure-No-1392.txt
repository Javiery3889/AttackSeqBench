### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager using the `enum_secrets` module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **TTP 1:** Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using the `enum_secrets` module.
   - **TTP 2:** Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **TTP 1 (Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager):**
     - This action is typically part of the **Credential Access** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The `enum_secrets` module is a specific tool or technique used to enumerate and retrieve secrets from cloud services like AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **TTP 2 (Gather information on network and host configurations):**
     - This action is typically part of the **Discovery** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Using native OS binaries for reconnaissance is a common technique to gather information about the network and host configurations.

4. **Evaluate the Plausibility:**
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical for an attacker to first gain access to secrets (such as credentials) before performing reconnaissance. This is because having access to secrets can provide the attacker with the necessary credentials to move laterally within the network and gather more detailed information.
   - **Common Attack Patterns:**
     - In many attack scenarios, attackers first focus on gaining initial access and then move on to reconnaissance. Retrieving secrets is often a crucial step in gaining the necessary credentials to perform further actions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the logical sequence and common attack patterns, it is plausible that FIN13 would retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager before gathering information on network and host configurations.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
