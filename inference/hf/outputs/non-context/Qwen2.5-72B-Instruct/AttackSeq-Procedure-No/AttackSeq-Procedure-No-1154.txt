### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SBDH malware.
   - The malware first employs powerful filters to collect targeted data based on specific criteria (file extension, creation date, and file size).
   - The question then asks whether the malware will likely incorporate junk data into encoded strings to prevent trivial decoding for network communication with its C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - Incorporating junk data into encoded strings is a common technique used to obfuscate network traffic and make it harder for defenders to decode and analyze the data being transmitted.
     - This technique is often used to evade detection by network security tools and to prevent trivial decoding of the data.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - If the malware does not incorporate junk data, the encoded strings might be easier to decode, making it more vulnerable to detection and analysis by security tools.
     - This would be less effective in maintaining stealth and evading detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the SBDH malware is described as employing powerful filters to collect targeted data, it is likely that the malware is designed to be sophisticated and stealthy.
   - Incorporating junk data into encoded strings is a common and effective technique to prevent trivial decoding and maintain stealth during network communication with the C&C server.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the SBDH malware would use this technique to enhance its Command and Control communications.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
