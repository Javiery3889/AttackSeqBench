### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with initial access through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - The RTF document drops an embedded downloader file.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control (C2) using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full Remote Access Tool (RAT) component from a specific IP address and port.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CVE-2012-0158 is a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is a common method for initial access.
   - **Downloader File:**
     - The embedded downloader file is typical in such attacks. It is used to download additional malware components.
   - **MSIL/Crimson Malware:**
     - MSIL/Crimson is a known malware that often uses custom protocols for C2 communication.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - Establishing C2 using a custom TCP protocol is a plausible step for MSIL/Crimson to maintain control over the infected machine.
   - **Downloading the Full RAT Component:**
     - After establishing C2, it is common for malware to download additional components, such as a full RAT, to gain more control over the victim's machine.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access through the weaponized RTF document and the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 is a well-documented method.
   - The embedded downloader file is a logical next step to download additional malware.
   - MSIL/Crimson malware is known to use custom TCP protocols for C2 communication, which aligns with the described sequence.
   - Downloading the full RAT component from a specified IP and port is a common final step to gain full control over the victim's machine.
