### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dropping Elephant APT group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - A file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
     - The backdoor downloading encoded blobs.
     - These blobs being decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will indeed download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
     - This aligns with common TTPs used by APT groups, including Dropping Elephant, which often use encoded payloads and scripts to evade detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: No**
     - This choice suggests that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will not download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
     - This is less likely, as APT groups frequently use such techniques to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Step 1: File Collection**
     - The file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions is a common data exfiltration technique.
   - **Step 2: Backdoor Activity**
     - The backdoor downloading encoded blobs is a typical method for maintaining persistence and executing additional payloads.
   - **Step 3: Decoding and Execution**
     - Decoding these blobs to PowerShell command line scripts is a common technique for defense evasion, as PowerShell scripts can be used to execute a wide range of commands and are often used to bypass security measures.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - Given the common TTPs used by APT groups like Dropping Elephant, it is highly likely that the backdoor will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
