### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers gained access to an Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial compromise.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to the CDN server.
   - **Strategic Web Compromise:** The attackers modified the `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` file, which is a common technique to inject malicious code into a legitimate website.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. After gaining access and modifying the file, the attackers might set up C2 channels to control the compromised server or other systems that load the modified JavaScript file.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While modifying the JavaScript file could be a form of defense evasion, it is more likely that this would occur after the initial compromise and modification.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the network. The question already states that the attackers have gained access, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources. This typically occurs before the initial access, not after.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the attackers have already gained access and modified the file, the next logical step would be to establish command and control over the compromised system or to use the modified file to gain control over other systems that load it.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
