### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already conducted network mapping and acquired credentials during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The next step involves the use of JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Network mapping and acquiring credentials.
   - **Next Step:** Use of JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This typically follows initial access and reconnaissance.
     - Given that the attacker has already acquired credentials and is now using JSPRAT for local command execution, lateral movement could be a plausible next step, but it is not the most immediate one in this context.
   - **B: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers.
     - This typically occurs before reconnaissance and initial access, not after.
   - **C: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry into the target network. This is a critical step that follows reconnaissance and precedes the use of tools like JSPRAT for command execution.
     - Given that the attacker has already conducted reconnaissance and is now using JSPRAT, initial access is a logical step that must have occurred before the use of JSPRAT.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance is the initial phase of gathering information about the target. The question already states that reconnaissance has been completed.
     - Therefore, this cannot be the next step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after reconnaissance, the attacker gained initial access to the network, which then allowed them to use JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
