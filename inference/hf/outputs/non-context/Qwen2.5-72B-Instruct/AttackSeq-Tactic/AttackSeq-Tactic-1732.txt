### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware components (netui3.dll and winmgt.dll) collect detailed system information, including IP addresses, platform details, and recursive directory listings.
   - After this collection, the malware self-deletes past a hardcoded date to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection of System Information:** This is a clear indication of the **Discovery** tactic, where the malware is gathering information about the system.
   - **Self-Deletion to Avoid Detection:** This is a clear indication of the **Defense Evasion** tactic, where the malware is attempting to avoid detection by deleting itself.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Self-deletion is a common technique under this tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. The question does not mention any data being sent out of the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials. The question does not mention any credential harvesting or access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. The collection of system information (IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings) fits this tactic.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Discovery** (Collection of system information)
     2. **Defense Evasion** (Self-deletion to avoid detection)

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that **Discovery** occurred before **Defense Evasion**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
