### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have used tools like RDPdoor and MBR Eraser to maintain remote access while reducing detection risks.
   - The key point is that the attackers have already evaded defenses and are maintaining access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - **Evasion:** Using tools like RDPdoor and MBR Eraser to reduce detection risks.
     - **Persistence:** Maintaining remote access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. Since the question already mentions that the attackers have used tools to evade defenses, this tactic has already occurred.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to access systems. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after maintaining access and evading detection.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is typically an early stage activity and not the most immediate next step after maintaining access and evading detection.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal and transfer data from the target network. After maintaining access and evading detection, exfiltration is a logical next step as the attackers would likely want to steal data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the context, the most plausible next step after maintaining access and evading detection is to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
