### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker uses API hooking techniques to evade detection by injecting code into a security product.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic allows the backdoor to connect with external entities for further communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** API hooking to evade detection.
   - **Next TTP:** Connecting with external entities for further communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after evading detection and establishing a backdoor.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by establishing a communication channel with the backdoor. This is a logical next step after evading detection and setting up the backdoor.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While API hooking is a form of defense evasion, the question is asking about the next step after the backdoor is established.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical next step after evading detection and setting up a backdoor is to establish a command and control (C2) channel to maintain control over the compromised system and facilitate further communication.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
