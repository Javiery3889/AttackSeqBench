### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers initially gained access through a watering hole attack using exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers then elevated privileges using a PowerShell loader to exploit CVE-2019-1458.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data and sending it to an external location. It is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the attacker has already established a foothold and possibly moved laterally.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the system. The question explicitly states that privilege escalation occurred after the initial access, so this cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the attacker moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. This is a common next step after gaining initial access but before privilege escalation.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on the system. This is typically part of the initial access phase, so it is unlikely to occur after initial access but before privilege escalation.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was gained through a watering hole attack using exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network to gain access to more systems.
   - Once the attacker has moved laterally, they can then focus on privilege escalation using the PowerShell loader to exploit CVE-2019-1458.
   - Exfiltration and execution are not the most plausible next steps in this sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
