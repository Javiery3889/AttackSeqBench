### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a malicious Word document uses Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands.
   - The document then creates persistence through a batch file and a registry entry.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely involved in the initial use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's access. It is not relevant to the initial execution of a malicious document.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. Using DDE to execute PowerShell commands is a form of execution.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of an action, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not relevant to the initial execution of a malicious document.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to a system. While DDE can be used for initial access, the question specifically mentions the use of DDE within a document that has already been opened, which is more aligned with execution.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands is a method of running malicious code, which falls under the **Execution** tactic.
   - The sequence described in the question involves the document being opened and then using DDE to execute PowerShell commands, which is a clear example of the **Execution** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
