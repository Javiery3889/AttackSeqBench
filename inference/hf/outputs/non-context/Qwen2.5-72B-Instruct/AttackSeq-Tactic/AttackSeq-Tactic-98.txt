### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Execution of Shellcode script functionalities in memory without writing to the hard disk.
     2. Lateral movement within the internal network for attack operations.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords. This is often a prerequisite for lateral movement but not necessarily a step that occurs immediately after executing shellcode in memory.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Executing shellcode in memory without writing to the hard disk is a form of defense evasion. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. The execution of shellcode in memory is already part of the Execution tactic, so this choice does not fit the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is explicitly mentioned as the final step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer to what occurred between the other two steps.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The execution of shellcode in memory is a form of defense evasion, as it avoids leaving traces on the disk.
   - After evading defenses, the next logical step before lateral movement would be to ensure that the adversary has the necessary credentials or access to move laterally.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the execution of shellcode and lateral movement is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Credential Access
