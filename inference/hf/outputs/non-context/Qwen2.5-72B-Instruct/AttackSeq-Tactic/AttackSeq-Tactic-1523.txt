### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Whitefly.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Network mapping
     - Infection of further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities
     - Exfiltration of large volumes of information over time

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Phase:** Network mapping (Reconnaissance)
   - **Middle Phase:** Infection of further computers (Lateral Movement)
   - **Final Phase:** Exfiltration of information (Exfiltration)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. This is typically a continuous process that occurs throughout the attack but is not specifically mentioned as a step between network mapping and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it is not specifically mentioned as a step between network mapping and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This fits well with the description of infecting further computers using publicly available tools and vulnerabilities.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target network. While this is a necessary step before exfiltration, it is not specifically mentioned as a step between network mapping and exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that Lateral Movement occurred after network mapping and before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
