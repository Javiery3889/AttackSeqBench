### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a spear phishing attack that uses a malicious Excel file to deliver a payload.
   - The target is the Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the spear phishing attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear phishing attack is a common method for gaining initial access to a target's system.
   - **Execution:** Once the malicious Excel file is opened, the payload is delivered and executed on the target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as creating malicious files or setting up infrastructure. This typically occurs before the attack, not after.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. While persistence is a common next step after gaining initial access, it is not the immediate next step after the payload is delivered.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system and network. Discovery often occurs after gaining initial access and executing the payload to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. In this scenario, the execution of the payload is part of the initial attack, not a subsequent step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after the spear phishing attack delivers the payload (initial access and execution), the next step would be for the attacker to gather information about the target system and network to plan further actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
