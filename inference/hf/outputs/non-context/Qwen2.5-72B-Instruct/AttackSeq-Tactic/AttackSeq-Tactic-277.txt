### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor group FIN8.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Discovering the Domain Controller.
     - Performing domain trust discovery using commands like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.
     - Using `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery:** The initial actions of discovering the Domain Controller and performing domain trust discovery fall under the Discovery tactic.
   - **Execution:** Using `wmic.exe` to execute the BADHATCH deployment script is an execution action.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Executing a script on the Domain Controller from a different system is a form of lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (A):** This tactic is already covered in the initial actions of discovering the Domain Controller and performing domain trust discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This is the most likely next step after discovery, as the threat actor is using `wmic.exe` to execute a script on the Domain Controller, which is a different system.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C):** While privilege escalation might be involved in the overall attack, the question specifically mentions the use of `wmic.exe` to execute a script on the Domain Controller, which is more indicative of lateral movement.
   - **Collection (D):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system, which is not the focus of the described action.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
