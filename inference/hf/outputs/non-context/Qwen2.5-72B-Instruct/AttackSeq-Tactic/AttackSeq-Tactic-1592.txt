### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Industroyer2, a malware known for targeting industrial control systems (ICS), is deployed using the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol to disrupt operations at electrical stations and substations.
   - After the deployment of Industroyer2, wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are mentioned.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the malware execution involving these wipers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Deployment:** Industroyer2 is deployed to target ICS.
   - **Malware Execution:** The malware is executed to disrupt operations.
   - **Wiper Activity:** Wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are used.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's access. While lateral movement can occur during an attack, it is typically a step taken before or during the initial deployment and execution of malware, not after the use of wipers.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. The execution of Industroyer2 and the wipers is already part of the described sequence, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves manipulating, interrupting, or destroying systems and data to achieve the attacker's goals. Wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are designed to cause destruction and data loss, which aligns with the Impact tactic.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network and systems. Discovery typically occurs before the deployment of malware, not after the use of wipers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves the deployment and execution of Industroyer2 to disrupt operations.
   - After this, wipers like CaddyWiper and SoloShred are used, which are designed to cause destruction and data loss.
   - The use of wipers to cause destruction and data loss aligns with the Impact tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Impact
