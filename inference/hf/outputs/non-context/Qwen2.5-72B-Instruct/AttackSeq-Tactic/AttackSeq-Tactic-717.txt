### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Naikon APT group after they have already conducted discovery.
   - The actions include searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery:** The group has already conducted discovery to gather system and network information.
   - **Subsequent Actions:** The group is now searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems under their control. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it does not directly align with the actions of searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves the techniques adversaries use to gather data from a target network. Actions like searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules are typical collection activities.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques used to gain information about the target system and network. The question states that discovery has already been conducted, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques used to obtain credentials for access to systems. The actions described (searching for files, taking screenshots, and enumerating loaded modules) do not directly involve credential access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the actions described, is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
