### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor "Whitefly."
   - Whitefly uses tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials and compromise additional machines on the network.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurs before Whitefly maps the network and exploits vulnerabilities to gain further control over infected systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Harvesting credentials using tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Compromising additional machines on the network.
   - **Next Action:** Mapping the network and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain further control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts.
     - This is a logical step after gaining initial access and harvesting credentials, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to plan further actions.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems.
     - This is typically a step that occurs after initial access and is maintained throughout the attack, but it is not a prerequisite for mapping the network.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves increasing the attacker's level of access on a system.
     - This is often a step that occurs after initial access and before lateral movement, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite for network mapping.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network.
     - This is a step that occurs after the attacker has gained initial access and possibly after privilege escalation, but it is not a prerequisite for network mapping.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves harvesting credentials and compromising additional machines.
   - After gaining access to additional machines, the next logical step is to map the network to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - The tactic that best fits this step is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Discovery
