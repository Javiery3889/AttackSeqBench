### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers used the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for communication with a command and control (C2) domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this communication was established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
     2. Communication with a C2 domain was established.
   - We need to identify what typically happens next in the attack lifecycle.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that attackers use to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to gain access to systems or accounts.
     - While this is a common tactic, it is typically used earlier in the attack lifecycle to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network. It is less likely to be the immediate next step after establishing C2 communication.
   - **B: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that attackers use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data to achieve their goals.
     - This is often a later stage in the attack lifecycle, typically after the attackers have established a foothold, moved laterally, and gathered necessary information. It is not the most immediate next step after C2 communication.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques that attackers use to communicate with compromised systems to control them.
     - The question already states that C2 communication has been established using the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload. Therefore, this tactic has already occurred and cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that attackers use to move through a network to expand their access and control.
     - After establishing C2 communication, attackers often move laterally to gain access to other systems within the network. This is a logical next step in the attack lifecycle.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the attack lifecycle and the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 communication is Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
