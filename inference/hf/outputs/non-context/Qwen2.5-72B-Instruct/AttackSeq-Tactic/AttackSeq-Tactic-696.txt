### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     - COM object hijacking for persistence.
     - Deleting files and disabling security tools.
     - Uploading and using dumpers to target credentials in browsers and email clients.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over a compromised system. It is typically used after initial access and persistence are established, but it does not align with the specific action of deleting files and disabling security tools.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. While deleting files could be part of this, the question specifically mentions disabling security tools, which is more aligned with evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as passwords and API keys. It is relevant to the final step of using dumpers to target credentials but not to the step of deleting files and disabling security tools.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Deleting files and disabling security tools are common defense evasion techniques used to maintain access and prevent discovery.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that APT28 used defense evasion to delete files and disable security tools before moving on to credential access.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
