### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving a malicious macro in a phishing email that leads to the execution of a payload.
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. Phishing emails with portable executable attachments are sent to U.S. utility providers.
     2. The FlowCloud malicious macro is executed.
     3. 'gup.exe' is executed using a renamed `certutil.exe` file to deliver the payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Phishing Emails:** This is the initial step where the attackers send emails to gain access to the target systems.
   - **Malicious Macro Execution:** The macro in the attachment is executed, which is a form of initial execution.
   - **Payload Delivery:** The macro uses a renamed `certutil.exe` to execute `gup.exe` and deliver the payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system, which is typically achieved through phishing, drive-by downloads, or other initial entry points. The phishing emails with attachments are a clear example of Initial Access.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves the execution of the malicious code on the target system. The execution of the malicious macro and the subsequent execution of `gup.exe` fall under this category, but they occur after the initial access.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target system. There is no mention of credential harvesting in the sequence described.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems. The sequence described does not mention any lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with phishing emails, which is a common method for Initial Access.
   - After gaining access, the malicious macro is executed, which is part of the Execution tactic.
   - The use of a renamed `certutil.exe` to execute `gup.exe` and deliver the payload is also part of the Execution tactic.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Initial Access tactic occurred first, followed by Execution.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
