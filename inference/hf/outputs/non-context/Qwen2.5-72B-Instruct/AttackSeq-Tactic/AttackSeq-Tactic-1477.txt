### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Duke group using the Seaduke malware.
   - The actions include retrieving bot/system information, updating configurations, and securely deleting malware from victim systems using the 'seppuku' function.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Retrieving bot/system information:** This action is typically associated with the **Discovery** tactic, where the attacker gathers information about the system.
   - **Updating configurations:** This action can be related to the **Persistence** or **Privilege Escalation** tactics, as it involves making changes to the system to maintain access or gain higher privileges.
   - **Securely deleting malware using the 'seppuku' function:** This action is a form of **Defense Evasion**. The 'seppuku' function is designed to remove traces of the malware to avoid detection and forensic analysis.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for the initial and ongoing control, it does not directly align with the actions described in the question.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim system. While retrieving bot/system information could be part of collection, the question also mentions updating configurations and securely deleting malware, which are not primarily collection activities.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The 'seppuku' function, which securely deletes malware, is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves transferring data from the victim system to the attacker. The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the actions described in the question is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
