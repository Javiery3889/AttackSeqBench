### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a user enables a macro within a lure document, which then triggers malicious PowerShell commands.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The user enables a macro within a lure document, which is a common method for initial access.
   - **Execution:** The macro triggers malicious PowerShell commands, which is part of the execution phase.
   - **Obfuscation:** The campaign employs obfuscated scripts, which is a technique used for defense evasion.
   - **PRB-Backdoor Payload:** The final step is the deployment of the PRB-Backdoor payload, which could be part of persistence or other tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation of scripts is a common technique used to evade detection by security tools and analysts. This aligns well with the step where the campaign employs obfuscated scripts.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** Exfiltration involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a network. This is not relevant to the sequence described, which focuses on initial access and execution.
   - **C: Persistence:** Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over an extended period. While the PRB-Backdoor payload could be used for persistence, the question specifically asks about the step before the obfuscation of scripts.
   - **D: Initial Access:** Initial access is the first step in the sequence, where the user enables the macro. However, the question asks about the step before the obfuscation of scripts, which occurs after initial access and execution.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the campaign employed obfuscated scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload as part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
