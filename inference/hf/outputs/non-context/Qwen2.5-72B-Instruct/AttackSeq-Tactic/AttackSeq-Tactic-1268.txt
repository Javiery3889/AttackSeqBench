### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, the threat group (TG1021) escalates privileges using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll with dynamic DLL loading and token manipulation.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the privilege escalation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll with dynamic DLL loading and token manipulation.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It typically occurs after initial access and privilege escalation to ensure the attacker can return to the system. Therefore, it is unlikely to occur before privilege escalation.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the first step (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers). It cannot be the answer because it is the starting point of the attack sequence.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before privilege escalation. The attacker needs to execute the tools (PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll) to escalate privileges.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing or acquiring tools. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not a step that would occur between initial access and privilege escalation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access, the attacker would need to execute the tools to escalate privileges. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before privilege escalation is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
