### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Desert Falcons gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, they managed three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over their victims.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** After gaining initial access, the attackers manage multiple campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over the victims.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the victim's network. While this is a common next step after gaining control, it is not the most immediate or primary focus after initial access in this scenario.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the starting point of the attack (spear-phishing emails and targeted Facebook attacks). It is not the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before initial access, not after.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves maintaining control over the compromised systems. Given that the question mentions managing three separate campaigns with different C&C/IPs, this is the most logical next step after gaining initial access.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence described in the question involves gaining initial access through spear-phishing and targeted Facebook attacks, followed by managing multiple campaigns with different C&C/IPs to maintain control over the victims.
- The most plausible next step after gaining initial access is to establish and maintain command and control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
