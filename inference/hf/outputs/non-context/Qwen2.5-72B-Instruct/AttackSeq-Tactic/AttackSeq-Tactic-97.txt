### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT-TOCS.
   - The sequence includes the use of `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - The sequence also mentions running in memory to evade detection without writing to the hard disk.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - **Subsequent Step:** Running in memory to evade detection without writing to the hard disk.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. It is typically used to gain initial or additional access to systems.
     - This does not fit well with the sequence described, as the question does not mention any credential harvesting activities.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques used to gain initial entry into a system.
     - While `powershell.exe` can be used for initial access, the question implies that the system is already compromised and the focus is on maintaining control and evading detection.
   - **C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on a target system.
     - Using `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts is a clear example of the Execution tactic.
     - Running in memory to evade detection is a technique that often follows successful execution to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques to steal data from a target system.
     - The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities, so this does not fit the sequence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Execution tactic occurred after the use of `powershell.exe` to execute Shellcode scripts and before running in memory to evade detection.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
