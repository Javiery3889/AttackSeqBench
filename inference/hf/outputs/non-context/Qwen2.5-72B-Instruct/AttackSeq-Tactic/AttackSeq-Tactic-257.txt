### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers gained detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal domain names.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic likely occurred after this knowledge was gained but before the supply chain compromise was used to gain initial access to the victim's network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Phase:** Attackers gained intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems.
   - **Intermediate Phase:** The tactic we need to identify.
   - **Final Phase:** Supply chain compromise to gain initial access to the victim's network.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. However, the question states that the attackers already have intimate knowledge of the target's systems, so this phase is likely already completed.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as developing or acquiring tools, establishing infrastructure, and creating accounts. This is a logical step after gaining detailed knowledge and before executing the supply chain compromise.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target's systems. This is typically a later stage in the attack, after initial access has been gained.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target's systems. This is also a later stage, typically after initial access and possibly after execution.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step after gaining detailed knowledge and before using a supply chain compromise to gain initial access is to develop the necessary resources to support the attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Resource Development
