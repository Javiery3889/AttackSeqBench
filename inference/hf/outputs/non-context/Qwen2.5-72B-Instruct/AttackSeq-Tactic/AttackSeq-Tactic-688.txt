### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros.
   - The next step in the sequence is the backdoor program employing persistence by writing startup items.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained via malicious Excel documents with embedded macros.
   - **Persistence:** Backdoor program writes startup items to ensure it runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the final step mentioned in the question, where the backdoor program writes startup items. This is not the step that occurs before the backdoor program employs persistence.
   - **B: Execution:** This is the step where the malicious Excel document with embedded macros is executed, leading to the initial access. This is a plausible step that occurs before the backdoor program employs persistence.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This step involves attempting to obtain credentials, which is not mentioned in the question and is not a necessary step before writing startup items for persistence.
   - **D: Collection:** This step involves gathering data from the system, which is not mentioned in the question and is not a necessary step before writing startup items for persistence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Execution** of the malicious Excel document with embedded macros occurs before the backdoor program employs persistence by writing startup items.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
