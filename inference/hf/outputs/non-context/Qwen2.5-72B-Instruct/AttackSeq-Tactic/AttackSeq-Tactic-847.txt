### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Longhorn's malware has already established communication with its C&C (Command and Control) servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - The focus is on what happens **after** this communication is established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is the establishment of communication with the C&C server.
   - We need to determine the next logical step in the attack sequence.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold, but it is not necessarily the immediate next step after setting up C&C communication.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the attacker stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to an external location. This is a common next step after establishing C&C communication, as the attacker can now send commands to the malware to exfiltrate data.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves the attacker moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. This is also a common next step after establishing C&C communication, as the attacker can use the C&C channel to issue commands to move laterally.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C&C) is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that the malware has communicated with the C&C server, so this is not the next step.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C&C server, the next logical steps would be to either exfiltrate data or move laterally within the network.
   - Both exfiltration and lateral movement are plausible, but exfiltration is often a more immediate and common next step after establishing C&C communication, as the attacker can quickly start stealing data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
