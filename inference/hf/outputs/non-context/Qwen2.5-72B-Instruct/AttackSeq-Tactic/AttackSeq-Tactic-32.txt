### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections and specific URIs for commands.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the malware sending stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections and specific URIs for commands.
   - **Next TTP:** Stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) is sent to the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the described sequence of sending stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves running malicious code. This is not relevant to the described sequence of sending stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - The C2 tactic involves communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. While the initial communication with C2 domains is part of the sequence, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is sending stolen data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - The Exfiltration tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data from the victim's network to the attacker's infrastructure. This aligns perfectly with the described sequence of sending stolen data (keystrokes and screenshots) to the C2 infrastructure.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
