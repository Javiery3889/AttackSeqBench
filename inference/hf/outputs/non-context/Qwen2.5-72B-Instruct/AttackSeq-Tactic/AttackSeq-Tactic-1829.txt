### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with gaining initial access through a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via watering hole attacks.
   - The next step involves the Poison Ivy RAT communicating with domains such as diff.qohub.info.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access using a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via a watering hole attack.
   - **Next Step:** The Poison Ivy RAT communicates with external domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While persistence is a common next step, it typically follows the establishment of a command and control channel.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. Exfiltration usually occurs after the attacker has established a command and control channel and has identified valuable data.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it. Given that the Poison Ivy RAT is communicating with external domains, this is the most likely next step.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic has already been completed with the CVE 2014-0515 exploit.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved through a CVE 2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit via a watering hole attack.
   - The next logical step is for the attacker to establish a command and control channel to maintain and control the compromised system.
   - The communication of the Poison Ivy RAT with external domains (diff.qohub.info) indicates that the command and control channel has been established.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
