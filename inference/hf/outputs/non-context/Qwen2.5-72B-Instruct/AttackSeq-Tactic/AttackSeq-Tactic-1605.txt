### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used spear phishing emails containing OLE2 format documents with embedded links to gain initial access.
   - The attackers utilized an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear phishing emails to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection is a technique to evade defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code or commands on the target system. While this might occur after gaining initial access, the question specifically mentions the use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection, which is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already described in the question. The question is asking what happened after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection fits this category.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. The question describes actions taken after the initial access has been gained, so this is not the most plausible choice.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers used an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection, which is a form of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
