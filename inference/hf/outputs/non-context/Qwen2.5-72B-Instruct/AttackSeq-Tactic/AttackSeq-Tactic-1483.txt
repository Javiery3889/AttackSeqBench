### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The malware uses anti-debugging techniques to evade defenses.
   - After evading defenses, the malware gathers network information using the `GetAdaptersInfo()` function API.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Anti-debugging techniques to evade defenses (Tactic: Defense Evasion).
   - **Subsequent Action:** Gathering network information using `GetAdaptersInfo()` (Tactic: Discovery).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It is not directly related to the sequence of evading defenses and gathering network information.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they are operating in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. Gathering network information using `GetAdaptersInfo()` is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While gathering network information can be a precursor to lateral movement, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after evading defenses and before gathering network information.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure necessary to support an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware evaded defenses (Defense Evasion), then gathered network information (Discovery), and potentially prepared for lateral movement afterward.
   - Therefore, the tactic that occurred between evading defenses and gathering network information is Discovery.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
