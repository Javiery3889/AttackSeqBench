### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Establishing persistence by installing Explosive with service names under different file paths.
     2. Leveraging keylogging to gain administrator passwords on target servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Establishing Persistence:** This is a clear indication of the "Persistence" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The technique used here is likely "Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service" (T1543.003).
   - **Leveraging Keylogging:** This is a technique used to gain access to credentials, which falls under the "Credential Access" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The specific technique is "Input Capture: Keylogging" (T1056.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network. It does not fit the sequence described, as the question does not mention data exfiltration.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is a common tactic, the specific sequence described does not focus on evading defenses but rather on establishing persistence and gaining credentials.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the keylogging described in the question.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. The sequence described does not mention any reconnaissance activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker gained administrator passwords through keylogging, which is a technique under the "Credential Access" tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
