### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Outlaw hacking group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting a vulnerability on the Dovecot mail server.
     - Compromising an FTP server.
     - Joining the compromised servers to host an IRC bouncer for command and control.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before an attack. This is typically the first step in an attack sequence.
     - The question does not mention any reconnaissance activities, so this is unlikely to be the next step after the described actions.

   - **Initial Access (B):**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the target network. This is often achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing, or other means.
     - The question already states that the group exploited a vulnerability on the Dovecot mail server and compromised an FTP server, which are actions that fall under Initial Access. Therefore, this is not the next step.

   - **Execution (C):**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system to achieve the attacker's objectives.
     - After gaining access to the servers, the next logical step would be to execute commands or deploy additional tools to maintain control or further the attack. However, the question mentions that the servers were joined to host an IRC bouncer for command and control, which is more aligned with maintaining access rather than initial execution.

   - **Lateral Movement (D):**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network to expand the attacker's control.
     - The question describes the group joining the compromised servers to host an IRC bouncer for command and control. This suggests that the group is consolidating control over multiple systems, which is a key aspect of lateral movement.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described, the most plausible next step after compromising the servers and setting up the IRC bouncer for command and control is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
