### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a script named `versioninfo.bat` discovers system details, and another script named `unactivate.vbs` exfiltrates data using a POST request.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** `versioninfo.bat` discovers system details.
   - **Final Action:** `unactivate.vbs` exfiltrates data using a POST request.
   - **Intermediate Tactic:** We need to identify what logically fits between these two actions.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data out of a network or system. This is the final action in the sequence, so it cannot be the intermediate step.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system, which is already done by `versioninfo.bat`. This is the initial action, so it cannot be the intermediate step.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands or send data. This could logically occur after discovering system details and before exfiltrating data, as the attacker might need to send commands to the compromised system to prepare for exfiltration.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not as directly tied to the sequence of actions described as Command and Control.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible intermediate step between discovering system details and exfiltrating data is Command and Control. The attacker would likely use C2 to send commands to the compromised system to prepare for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
