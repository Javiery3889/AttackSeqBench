### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware via social engineering and the subsequent use of BlackEnergy plugins for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that facilitated communication between the malware and an external server, which occurred after the initial infection and before the credential harvesting and lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems they control within a target network.
     - It is essential for malware to establish a C2 channel to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
     - Given that the malware needs to communicate with an external server, this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves adversaries attempting to gather information about the system and network.
     - While discovery is important, it typically occurs after the initial C2 channel is established.
   - **C: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the consequences of an attack, such as data destruction or denial of service.
     - It is not relevant to the communication between the malware and an external server.
   - **D: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary.
     - While collection is important, it typically occurs after the initial C2 channel is established.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the establishment of a C2 channel to facilitate communication between the malware and an external server before any further actions like credential harvesting and lateral movement can occur.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
