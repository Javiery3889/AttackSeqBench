### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers initially compromised ESTsoft's server to distribute a trojaned software update.
   - The next step in the sequence is to establish communication between the infected SK Communications computers and the command and control (C2) server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps to avoid detection by exploiting trust in software updates.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Compromise: Compromising ESTsoft's server to distribute a trojaned software update.
   - Goal: Establish communication between infected SK Communications computers and the C2 server.
   - Intermediate Step: Avoid detection by exploiting trust in software updates.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing data from a network and sending it to an external location. This is not relevant to the intermediate step of avoiding detection by exploiting trust in software updates.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Exploiting trust in software updates to avoid detection fits well within this category.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is not directly related to avoiding detection by exploiting trust in software updates.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. This is the final step in the sequence, not the intermediate step.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers compromised ESTsoft's server to distribute a trojaned software update.
   - To avoid detection, they likely used techniques to evade defenses, such as exploiting the trust in the software update process.
   - Once the software update was distributed and the SK Communications computers were infected, the next step would be to establish communication with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible intermediate step is Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
