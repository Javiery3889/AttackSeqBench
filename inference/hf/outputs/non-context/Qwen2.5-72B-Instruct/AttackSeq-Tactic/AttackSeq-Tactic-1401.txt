### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the FriarFox browser extension.
   - The extension evaded detection, accessed user data, modified Firefox settings, and then contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - **Defense Evasion:** The extension evaded detection.
     - **Collection:** The extension accessed user data.
     - **Persistence:** The extension modified Firefox settings.
   - **Subsequent TTP:**
     - The extension contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While the extension did evade detection initially, the question is asking about the next step after the initial evasion.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the system. The extension did access user data, but the question is about the communication with a remote server.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. Contacting a remote server to retrieve a payload is a classic C2 activity.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. The question does not mention any impact activities like data destruction or system disruption.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that the extension contacted a remote server to retrieve the Scanbox payload, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
