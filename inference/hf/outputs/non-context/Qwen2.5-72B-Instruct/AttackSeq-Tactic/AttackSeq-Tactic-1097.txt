### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a spear phishing document is used to exploit CVE-2012-0158, which then results in the creation of a malware dropper named exp1ore.exe.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Spear Phishing Document**: This is a common method for delivering malware.
     - **Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158**: This is a specific vulnerability that is being exploited.
     - **Malware Dropper (exp1ore.exe)**: This is the outcome of the exploitation, where the malware is dropped onto the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious documents. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the actual attack and is not the immediate precursor to the exploitation.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it is not the immediate step that leads to the exploitation of a vulnerability.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining a foothold in the target's environment. Spear phishing is a common method for initial access, and it directly leads to the exploitation of the vulnerability.
   - **D: Impact**: This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data theft or system disruption. It is not a precursor to the exploitation but rather a result of the attack.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Initial Access** tactic (spear phishing) preceded the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 to create the malware dropper.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
