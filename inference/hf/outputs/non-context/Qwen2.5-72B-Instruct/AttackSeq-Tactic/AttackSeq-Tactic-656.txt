### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 (a known threat actor) uses malware like GAMEFISH, which is delivered through exploit documents in spear-phishing emails.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before APT28 moved laterally by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Malware (GAMEFISH) is executed through exploit documents in spear-phishing emails.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT28 moves laterally by exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support the attack, such as setting up command and control (C2) servers. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While exfiltration is a common goal of APTs, it is not a prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access other systems. This is a logical step before lateral movement, as having valid credentials can facilitate the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This is the final step in the sequence described, where APT28 moves to other systems. It cannot be the tactic that occurs before lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial compromise is achieved through spear-phishing emails with exploit documents.
   - To move laterally, APT28 needs to gain access to other systems. This is typically done by obtaining valid credentials.
   - Once APT28 has the necessary credentials, they can exploit known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move laterally.
   - Therefore, the most logical step before lateral movement is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
