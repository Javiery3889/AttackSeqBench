### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Turla group.
   - The sequence starts with "Initial Access" using stolen credentials.
   - The sequence ends with "Privilege Escalation" to obtain administrative rights on Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This is the final step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code, which could be a step in the sequence, but it is not necessarily the most logical step immediately after Initial Access and before Privilege Escalation.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This is the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which is a logical step after gaining initial access and before attempting to escalate privileges. The attacker would need to understand the environment to identify how to gain administrative rights.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (using stolen credentials) → Discovery (gathering information about the environment) → Privilege Escalation (obtaining administrative rights).

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
