### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained using weaponized RTF documents to exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker drops 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between dropping 'intel.wll' and executing the subsequent malware stages from the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Weaponized RTF documents exploit Microsoft Word vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:** Dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder.
   - **Subsequent Stages:** Executing malware stages from the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending data out of the network. It is not likely to occur between dropping 'intel.wll' and executing the subsequent malware stages.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. Dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder is a method of persistence, as it ensures that the malware will be loaded every time Word is opened.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While dropping 'intel.wll' could be a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs after dropping 'intel.wll' and before executing the subsequent stages.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure. Executing malware stages from the C&C server is a clear indication of C2 activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained through a weaponized RTF document.
   - The attacker then drops 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - After ensuring persistence, the next logical step is to establish command and control (C2) to execute the subsequent malware stages from the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
