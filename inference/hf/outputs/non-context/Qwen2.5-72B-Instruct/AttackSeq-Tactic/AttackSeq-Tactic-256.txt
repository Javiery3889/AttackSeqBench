### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the supply chain compromise through a compromised software update for Initial Access in the SolarWinds Orion platform attack.
   - The key elements are:
     - **UNC2452**: The threat actor group.
     - **Supply chain compromise**: The method used for Initial Access.
     - **SolarWinds Orion platform**: The target software.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for other actions. It is often the first step in a cyber attack, where the attacker identifies potential targets, vulnerabilities, and entry points.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It typically occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment after gaining access. It is used to understand the network topology, system configurations, and other details.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed to support the attack. This can include setting up command and control servers, creating malicious tools, and other preparatory activities.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A)**: Before a supply chain compromise, the attackers would need to gather information about the target, including the software they use, potential vulnerabilities, and the best points of entry. This is a crucial step in planning the attack.
   - **Command and Control (B)**: This tactic is not relevant before the initial access. It is used after the attackers have already gained a foothold in the network.
   - **Discovery (C)**: This tactic is also not relevant before the initial access. It is used after the attackers have gained access to the network to understand the environment better.
   - **Resource Development (D)**: While this is a preparatory step, it is more about setting up the infrastructure and tools needed for the attack. It is not as directly related to the specific act of identifying and compromising the software update process.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
