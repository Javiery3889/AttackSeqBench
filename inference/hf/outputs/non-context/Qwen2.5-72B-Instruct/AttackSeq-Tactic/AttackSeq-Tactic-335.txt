### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained by modifying Windows executables downloaded via a malicious Tor exit node.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker accessed stolen login credentials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gained access by modifying Windows executables downloaded via a malicious Tor exit node.
   - **Credential Access:** The attacker accessed stolen login credentials.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could occur after initial access, it is not necessarily the most immediate next step in the sequence.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials. However, the question states that this occurred after the step we are trying to identify.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. It is a logical next step after gaining initial access, as the attacker would need to understand the environment before accessing credentials.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described as the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gaining access by modifying Windows executables.
     2. **Discovery:** Exploring the system and network to understand the environment.
     3. **Credential Access:** Accessing stolen login credentials.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
