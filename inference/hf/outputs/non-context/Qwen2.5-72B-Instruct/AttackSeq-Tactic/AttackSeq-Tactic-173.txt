### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the Lazarus group initially gains access through a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application.
   - The next step in the sequence is the installation of a hidden 'autoupdater' module to achieve persistence.
   - We need to determine which MITRE ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gain access through a trojanized application.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers install a hidden 'autoupdater' module to maintain access.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this is a necessary step, it typically occurs immediately after gaining initial access and is part of the initial access process.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is a critical step but usually follows after the attackers have established a foothold and may occur after persistence is achieved.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attackers gathering information about the victim's environment. This is often a step taken after gaining initial access to understand the system and plan further actions.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already described in the question.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to understand the environment to plan their next steps, such as installing a hidden 'autoupdater' module for persistence.
   - Therefore, the most logical step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Discovery
