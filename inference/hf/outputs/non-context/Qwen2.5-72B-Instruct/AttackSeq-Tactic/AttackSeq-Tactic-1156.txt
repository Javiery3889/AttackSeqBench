### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where T9000 (a malware or tool) has already communicated with a C2 (Command and Control) server using encrypted traffic to relay collected information.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to determine how the stolen data is moved out of the victim environment.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **T9000 Communication with C2 Server:** This is part of the "Command and Control" tactic, where the malware communicates with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Relay Collected Information:** This indicates that the malware has already collected data and is now in the process of sending it to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the victim's system. It is not relevant to the movement of data out of the environment.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment. It is not relevant to the movement of data out of the environment.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the communication between the malware and the attacker's server. While this is part of the sequence, it does not specifically address the movement of data out of the environment.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and moving data out of the victim's environment. This is the most relevant tactic given the context of the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
