### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office via a malicious email attachment.
   - The next step in the sequence is Taidoor beaconing to a command-and-control (C2) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and the beaconing to the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office through a malicious email attachment.
   - **Next Step:** Taidoor beaconing to a C2 server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials. While credential access can occur after initial access, it is not a necessary step before beaconing to a C2 server.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. After gaining initial access through a vulnerability, the next logical step is to execute the payload (Taidoor) to establish a foothold and begin communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery can occur after initial access, it is not a necessary step before beaconing to a C2 server.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of the attack, it is not a necessary step before beaconing to a C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after gaining initial access, the next step is to execute the payload (Taidoor) to establish a foothold and begin communication with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between gaining initial access and beaconing to the C2 server is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Execution
