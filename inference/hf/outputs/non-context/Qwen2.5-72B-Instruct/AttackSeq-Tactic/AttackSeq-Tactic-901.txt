### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already evaded defenses using techniques like DLL side-loading to launch malicious payloads.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to establish communication and control over the compromised systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. While persistence is important, it is not the immediate next step after evading defenses and launching payloads.
   - **B: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question already states that the attacker has evaded defenses, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials to gain access to systems. While this can be a part of the attack, it is not the immediate next step after evading defenses and launching payloads.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with and control compromised systems. After evading defenses and launching payloads, the next logical step is to establish command and control to maintain and manage the compromised systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is to establish Command and Control after evading defenses and launching payloads.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
