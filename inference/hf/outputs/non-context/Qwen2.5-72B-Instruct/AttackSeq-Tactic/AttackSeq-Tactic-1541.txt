### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have already collected and prepared valuable documents related to internal applications and procedures.
   - The final step in this sequence is being asked.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence implies that the attackers have already gained access to the network, discovered valuable information, and prepared it for removal.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the process of gathering information about the target environment. This would typically occur before the collection and preparation of documents.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data out of the target network. This would logically follow the collection and preparation of documents.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in gaining entry to the target network. This would occur before any collection or preparation of documents.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves maintaining control over the compromised systems. This would typically occur after initial access and before or during the collection of documents.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the documents have already been collected and prepared, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate them from the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
