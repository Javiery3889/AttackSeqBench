### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a PowerShell loader is executed via an Internet Explorer exploit.
   - After this, the attackers use an LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 to gain system privileges.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the LPE.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with an Internet Explorer exploit, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - **Execution:** The PowerShell loader is executed, which is part of the Execution tactic.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers then use an LPE binary to gain higher privileges, which is part of the Privilege Escalation tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This is the tactic that directly follows the execution of the PowerShell loader. The LPE binary is used to escalate privileges, which is a clear indication of the Privilege Escalation tactic.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving from one system to another within a network. The question does not mention any lateral movement before the LPE.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic is already part of the initial steps where the PowerShell loader is executed. It does not fit as the next step before LPE.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question does not mention any command and control activities before the LPE.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Privilege Escalation tactic occurred before the attackers used the LPE binary to gain system privileges.

**Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation**
