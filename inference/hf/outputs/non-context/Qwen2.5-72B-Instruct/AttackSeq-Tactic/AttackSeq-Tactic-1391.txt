### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Mapping out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
     - **Leveraging Shared MSP Infrastructure:** Moving laterally between Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and other victims.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords. This is typically done to gain initial access or to move laterally within a network.
     - While Credential Access is a crucial step in many attack sequences, the question specifically mentions internal reconnaissance and mapping out the network, which suggests that the network has already been accessed and some level of reconnaissance has been performed.

   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This includes network scanning, system information discovery, and network service discovery.
     - The question mentions internal reconnaissance and mapping out the network, which aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic. This is the most likely step that occurs after gaining access and before moving laterally.

   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the adversary has achieved their primary objectives.
     - Given the context of the question, Impact is not a plausible next step after internal reconnaissance and before lateral movement.

   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. This is often necessary to perform more advanced actions, such as moving laterally.
     - While Privilege Escalation is a common step in attack sequences, the question specifically mentions internal reconnaissance, which suggests that the adversary is still in the information-gathering phase. Privilege Escalation would typically occur after the initial reconnaissance but before lateral movement.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after internal reconnaissance and before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally is the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
