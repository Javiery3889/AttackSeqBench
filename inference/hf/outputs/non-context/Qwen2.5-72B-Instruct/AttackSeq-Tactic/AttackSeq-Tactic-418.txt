### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers first scan for vulnerable hosts and collect information to identify exposed and misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exploitation of these misconfigured ports for Initial Access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information.
     2. Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports for Initial Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**:
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. It does not involve scanning or collecting information about potential targets.
   - **B: Execution**:
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. It is not relevant to the initial scanning and information collection phase.
   - **C: Initial Access**:
     - This tactic involves gaining initial foothold on a target system. While the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports is part of Initial Access, the question specifically asks about the step before this, which is the scanning and information collection.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**:
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. It aligns perfectly with the described activity of scanning for vulnerable hosts and collecting information to identify exposed and misconfigured instances.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers first performed Reconnaissance to identify the misconfigured Docker API ports, and then exploited them for Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
