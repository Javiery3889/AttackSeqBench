### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the OceanLotus group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using stolen credentials.
     - Using Windows built-in tools.
     - Performing pass-the-ticket and pass-the-hash attacks.
     - Exfiltrating data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Using stolen credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using Windows built-in tools and pass-the-ticket/pass-the-hash attacks to infect new machines.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** Exfiltrating data through a backdoor in Microsoft Outlook.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It typically occurs before the initial compromise, not after.
   - **Command and Control (B):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is often used after initial access and lateral movement but before data exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement (C):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. It fits well between using stolen credentials and exfiltrating data.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. It can occur at various stages but is not the most likely next step after lateral movement and before data exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using stolen credentials to gain initial access, then using lateral movement techniques to spread to other machines, and finally exfiltrating data.
   - The most logical step between using stolen credentials and exfiltrating data is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
