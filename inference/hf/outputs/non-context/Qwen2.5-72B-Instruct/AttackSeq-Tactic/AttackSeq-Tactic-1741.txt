### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Turla group.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. **Discovery**: Turla used LightNeuron to discover system network configurations.
     2. **Command and Control (C2)**: Turla used emails to conduct C2 communication with encrypted data hidden in PDF or JPG files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. While persistence is a crucial step in many attack sequences, it is not typically the immediate next step after discovery and before C2.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain initial access to a system. Since the question already mentions that Turla has discovered network configurations, initial access has likely already occurred.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the target system. While collection can occur at various points in an attack, it is not the most logical next step after discovery and before C2.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The question explicitly states that Turla used emails for C2 communication, so this is the final step in the sequence.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Tactic:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step between discovering network configurations and establishing C2 communication is to **establish a foothold or maintain access** to the network. However, since the question specifies that the discovery has already occurred and the C2 communication is the next step, the most plausible tactic that fits between these two steps is **Command and Control** itself, as it directly follows the discovery phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
