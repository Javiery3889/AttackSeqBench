### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the ATMitch malware.
   - Key points:
     - ATMitch reads commands from a file.
     - It logs actions into a local directory.
     - It dispenses cash by interacting with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it.
     - While ATMitch reads commands from a file, this is more about execution rather than command and control.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker achieving their goal, such as data theft, system destruction, or financial loss.
     - Dispensing cash from an ATM is a clear example of achieving the attacker's goal, which is financial gain.
   - **C: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems.
     - The question does not mention any credential harvesting or access.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gaining the initial foothold on the system.
     - The question does not describe the initial entry point but rather the actions taken after gaining access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The sequence of actions described in the question focuses on the final step of the attack, where the malware dispenses cash.
     - Dispensing cash is a direct impact on the system, leading to financial loss.
     - The other answer choices (Command and Control, Credential Access, Initial Access) do not align as closely with the described action of dispensing cash.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is the "Impact" tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Impact**
