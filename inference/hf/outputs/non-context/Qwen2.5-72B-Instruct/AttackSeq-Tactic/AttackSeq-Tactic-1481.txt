### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The sequence starts with the execution of a Visual Basic macro embedded in an Excel document.
   - The sequence ends with the use of `RegSetValueExw()` to register `FONTCACHE.DAT` for execution upon system startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Execution of a Visual Basic macro.
   - **Final Action:** Registering `FONTCACHE.DAT` for execution upon system startup.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Registering a file for execution upon system startup is a classic persistence technique.
     - This fits well with the final action described in the question.

   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. This is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.
     - This does not fit well with the sequence described, as it is more about maintaining control rather than setting up persistence.

   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information they can use to plan future operations. This typically occurs before the initial compromise.
     - This does not fit well with the sequence described, as it is more about gathering information rather than setting up persistence.

   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. This can include techniques to hide their presence or actions.
     - While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, the specific action of registering a file for execution upon system startup is more closely related to persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the Visual Basic macro is executed, the malware sets up persistence by registering `FONTCACHE.DAT` for execution upon system startup.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
