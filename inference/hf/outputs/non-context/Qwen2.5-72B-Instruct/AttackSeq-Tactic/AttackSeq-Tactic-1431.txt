### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the StellarParticle campaign used tools like AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access.
   - The key actions here are gathering information about the Active Directory and identifying systems for access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While gathering Active Directory information can be part of reconnaissance, the question implies that the information has already been gathered and is being used to identify systems for access, which is a step beyond initial reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining initial foothold in the network. The actions described (gathering Active Directory information and identifying systems) are not typically part of initial access but rather a step that follows it.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. The use of AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tools to gather Active Directory information and identify systems for access aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. While identifying systems for access can be a precursor to credential access, the question does not explicitly mention the acquisition of credentials.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Discovery tactic. The actions of gathering Active Directory information and identifying systems for access are typical of the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
