### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Higaisa APT group used a JavaScript file to execute the command `cmd /c ipconfig` to retrieve IP address information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The action described is the execution of a command to retrieve IP address information, which is a form of **Discovery** (Tactic T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be part of the overall attack, it is not directly related to the action of retrieving IP address information.
   - **B: Impact** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. Retrieving IP address information is not an impact action.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is typically done before the actual attack and is not directly related to the action of retrieving IP address information.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. The action of executing `cmd /c ipconfig` to retrieve IP address information is a clear example of a discovery technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred before the Higaisa APT group used the JavaScript file to execute `cmd /c ipconfig` to retrieve IP address information.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
