### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where stolen credentials have been sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Stolen credentials were obtained.
     2. Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a network. This typically happens before credentials are stolen and sent to a C2 server. Therefore, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques that adversaries use to steal and transfer data out of a network. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions that the stolen credentials were already sent to a C2 server, which is more aligned with the Command and Control phase.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. Since the stolen credentials have been sent to a C2 server, the next logical step would be for the adversary to use these credentials to establish and maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials from a system. This step has already been completed, as the question states that the credentials were stolen and sent to the C2 server.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step after the stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server is for the adversary to use these credentials to establish and maintain command and control over the compromised system.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
