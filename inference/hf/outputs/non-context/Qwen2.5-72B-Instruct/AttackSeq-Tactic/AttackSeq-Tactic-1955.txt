### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already surveyed the victim's computer and sent information such as the name, machine serial number, and system information to a remote server.
   - The next step involves using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - **Discovery:** The attacker has already gathered information about the victim's system.
     - **Exfiltration:** The gathered information has been sent to a remote server.
   - **Next TTP:**
     - The use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 suggests that the attacker is establishing a secure communication channel to maintain control over the compromised system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system, which has already been done.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the victim's system, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which aligns with the use of a custom binary protocol and AES encryption on TCP port 443.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves sending data from the victim's system to the attacker, which has already been done.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible next step in the attack sequence is establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
