### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker uses `InstallUtil.exe` for defense evasion and then injects a malicious payload into memory.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is indicated by the payload's communication pattern with an attacker-controlled server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using `InstallUtil.exe` to evade defenses.
   - **Execution:** Injecting the malicious payload into memory.
   - **Next Step:** The payload communicates with an attacker-controlled server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by communicating with it. The communication pattern with the attacker-controlled server strongly suggests that the payload is establishing a C2 channel.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions communication with an attacker-controlled server, which is more indicative of C2.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While exfiltration might occur later, the initial communication pattern is more likely to be for establishing C2.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic has already been used in the initial steps (using `InstallUtil.exe`), so it is not the next step in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the payload's communication pattern with the attacker-controlled server, is Command and Control (C2).

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
