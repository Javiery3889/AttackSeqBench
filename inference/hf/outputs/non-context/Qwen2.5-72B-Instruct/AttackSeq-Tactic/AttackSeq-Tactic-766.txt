### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Darkhotel APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial access is achieved through a social engineering technique where malware is disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - This suggests that the attackers had prior knowledge of the targets and the software they use.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This could include identifying the software and updates that the targets are likely to use.
     - This is a logical step that would occur before the initial access, as the attackers need to know what software to mimic.
   - **B: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials from the target. This is typically a step that occurs after gaining some form of access to the target's environment.
     - It is less likely to occur before the initial access.
   - **C: Collection:**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target's environment. This is a step that occurs after gaining access to the target's systems.
     - It is not a plausible step before the initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure and tools needed for the attack. This could include setting up command and control servers or creating the malware.
     - While this is a necessary step, it is not as directly related to the specific targeting of hotel guests with software updates as Reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the initial access is Reconnaissance. The attackers needed to gather information about the targets and the software they use to successfully disguise the malware as legitimate updates.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
