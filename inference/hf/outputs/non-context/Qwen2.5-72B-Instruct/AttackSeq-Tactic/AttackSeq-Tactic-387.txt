### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where visitors to compromised websites were exposed to exploits through browser fingerprinting, and spearphishing campaigns distributing malicious Word documents were launched.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Browser Fingerprinting:** This is a technique used to gather information about a user's browser and device to uniquely identify them. It is often used in the **Reconnaissance** phase to gather information about potential targets.
   - **Spearphishing Campaigns:** These are targeted phishing attacks that often involve sending malicious documents to specific individuals. This is typically part of the **Initial Access** phase, where the attacker gains a foothold in the target's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating malicious documents, and developing tools. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the specific actions mentioned in the question.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It is a later phase in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target. Browser fingerprinting is a form of reconnaissance, and it is likely that the attacker would gather information about potential targets before launching spearphishing campaigns.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining a foothold in the target's system. While spearphishing is a method of initial access, the question implies that the reconnaissance phase (browser fingerprinting) occurred before the spearphishing campaigns.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first conducted reconnaissance (browser fingerprinting) to gather information about potential targets, and then used this information to launch spearphishing campaigns.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the described events is **Reconnaissance**.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
