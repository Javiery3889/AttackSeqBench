### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving Mustang Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts.
     - Leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts.
   - **Next Step:** Leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection fits this tactic.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from a target network. This is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery might occur after initial access, it is not the most immediate next step in the context of evading detection.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. The initial spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files already involves execution, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files containing HTA scripts.
     2. **Defense Evasion:** Leveraging PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads to evade detection.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the initial access but before leveraging the payloads to evade detection is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
