### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Carbanak compromised a Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure using admin-level credentials.
   - The key points are:
     - Compromising a Domain Administrator account.
     - Using admin-level credentials to move across the infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a target system. This is typically an early stage in an attack but does not directly lead to compromising a Domain Administrator account.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a critical step after initial access but does not directly lead to compromising a Domain Administrator account.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the target system. This is a later stage in an attack and does not directly lead to compromising a Domain Administrator account.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining long-term access to the target system. This is a crucial step that often involves compromising high-privilege accounts like a Domain Administrator to ensure continued access and movement across the infrastructure.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Compromising a Domain Administrator account is a significant step in gaining persistence and ensuring long-term access to the network.
   - Before moving across the entire infrastructure using admin-level credentials, the attackers would need to establish persistence to maintain control and ensure they can continue their operations.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before compromising the Domain Administrator account is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
