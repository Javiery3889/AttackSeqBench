### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Employing backdoors to list interesting files.
     - Leveraging malicious macros in Word and Excel documents.
     - Propagating through Outlook VBA macros.
     - Searching for sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this might be a part of the attack, the question specifically mentions searching for sensitive documents, which is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data of interest to the adversary from the target system. The question explicitly states that the group is searching for sensitive documents, which is a clear indication of the Collection tactic.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While backdoors and macros can be used for command and control, the focus of the question is on the search for sensitive documents.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is not the primary focus of the question, which is on the search for sensitive documents.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Collection tactic, as it directly aligns with the activity of searching for sensitive documents.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
