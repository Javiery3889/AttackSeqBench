### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary has already ensured persistence by setting registry keys and deploying a DLL to load on Windows startup.
   - The next step in the sequence involves communication with the adversary's infrastructure using HTTP or HTTPS requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network, identify system configurations, and gather information about the environment. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it does not directly relate to the communication with the adversary's infrastructure.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves ensuring that the adversary's access to the system remains even after a system reboot or other disruptions. The question already states that persistence has been established.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Communication with the adversary's infrastructure using HTTP or HTTPS requests is a key component of C2.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the system. While this is a necessary step, it typically occurs before or during the persistence phase, not after.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after ensuring persistence, the next step is to establish command and control to communicate with the adversary's infrastructure.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
