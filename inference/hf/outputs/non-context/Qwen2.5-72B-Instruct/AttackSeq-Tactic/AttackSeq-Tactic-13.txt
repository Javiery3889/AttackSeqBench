### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites to distribute "Machete" malware embedded in disguised PowerPoint presentations.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Spear-phishing emails
     - Fake blog websites
     - Disguised PowerPoint presentations containing "Machete" malware

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that attackers use to gain a foothold in a network. This includes spear-phishing, drive-by compromises, and other methods to deliver malware.
     - The use of spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites to distribute malware is a clear example of Initial Access.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that allow attackers to maintain their presence in a network over time. This includes creating new accounts, modifying existing accounts, and using various methods to ensure they can regain access if their initial entry point is discovered.
     - While persistence is a crucial step in an attack, it typically follows initial access.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques used to gather data from the victim's network. This includes data exfiltration, keylogging, and other methods to collect sensitive information.
     - Collection is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and would not occur immediately after initial access.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques used to gather information about the target before the attack. This includes scanning networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and gathering intelligence.
     - Reconnaissance is typically a pre-attack phase and would not occur after the initial access has been established.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described in the question, the most plausible next step after using spear-phishing emails and fake blog websites to distribute malware is Initial Access.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
