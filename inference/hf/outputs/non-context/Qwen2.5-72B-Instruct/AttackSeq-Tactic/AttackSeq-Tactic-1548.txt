### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first use anti-analysis techniques and gather data on the victim's computer, including kernel information and anti-virus presence.
   - After this, the backdoor's capabilities are utilized to collect extensive system data like file and process information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network, which aligns with the gathering of kernel information and anti-virus presence.
     - However, the question states that this data gathering has already occurred.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware.
     - This tactic typically occurs before the initial compromise and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time.
     - This tactic is typically used after initial access and before or during the collection of extensive system data.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system, which aligns with the backdoor's capabilities being utilized to collect extensive system data like file and process information.
     - This tactic fits the sequence described, as it occurs after the initial data gathering and before the extensive data collection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used anti-analysis techniques and gathered initial data, then established persistence to maintain access, and finally used the backdoor to collect extensive system data.
   - Therefore, the tactic that fits between the initial data gathering and the extensive data collection is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
