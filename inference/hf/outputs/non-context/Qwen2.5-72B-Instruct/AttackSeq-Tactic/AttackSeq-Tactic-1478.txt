### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Duke group has already established a secure communication channel with their command-and-control (C2) server using layered encryption and encoding.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur **after** this secure communication is established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Initial compromise (implied but not explicitly mentioned).
     2. Establishment of a secure C2 communication channel.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised system. While this can occur after establishing C2, it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending the collected data back to the attacker. This typically follows collection and is a logical next step after establishing a secure C2 channel.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. This can occur after establishing C2, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic that involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that a secure C2 channel has been established, so this is not a subsequent step.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the secure C2 channel is already established, the most logical next step would be to exfiltrate any collected data back to the attacker. This aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where data is collected and then exfiltrated.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
