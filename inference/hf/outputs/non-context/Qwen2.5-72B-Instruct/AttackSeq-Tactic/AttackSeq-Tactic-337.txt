### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where login credentials are stolen using the OnionDuke malware.
   - After stealing the credentials, the compromised system's information (e.g., presence of antivirus software or firewall) is gathered.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Stealing login credentials using OnionDuke malware.
   - **Subsequent Step:** Gathering information about the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
     - While C2 is crucial for maintaining access, it typically occurs after initial access and credential theft.
   - **B: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is already described as the initial step in the question.
     - Therefore, this cannot be the answer as it does not fit the sequence of events after credential theft.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the compromised system, such as network configuration, system information, and security software.
     - This aligns perfectly with the described step of gathering information about the presence of antivirus software or a firewall.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack.
     - While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and credential theft, not after.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after stealing the login credentials, the attacker would use the **Discovery** tactic to gather information about the compromised system.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
