### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using the PoisonIvy Trojan to dump Windows cached password hashes for credential access.
     - Preparing collected intellectual property for exfiltration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - The Exfiltration tactic involves techniques for stealing data from a network. While the question mentions preparing intellectual property for exfiltration, it does not describe the communication for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - The Command and Control tactic involves techniques for communicating with compromised systems to control them. This fits the context of maintaining communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - The Persistence tactic involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. While persistence is important for long-term control, it does not specifically describe the communication for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the attackers are maintaining communication with a server to receive commands and retrieve binary code. This is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - The other answer choices (Impact, Exfiltration, and Persistence) do not align as closely with the specific communication and control aspect described in the question.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
