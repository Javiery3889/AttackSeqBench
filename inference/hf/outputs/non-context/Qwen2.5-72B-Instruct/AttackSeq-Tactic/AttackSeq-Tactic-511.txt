### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a payload (Crimson RAT) is dropped and designed to kill processes to evade detections.
   - The next step involves functionalities like keylogging and browser credential theft.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Process killing to evade detections.
   - **Next TTP:** Keylogging and browser credential theft.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
     - While C2 is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically follows initial access and is not directly related to keylogging or credential theft.
   - **B: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as keylogging and credential dumping.
     - Keylogging and browser credential theft are directly related to credential access.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access.
     - While lateral movement can follow credential access, it is not the immediate next step after keylogging and browser credential theft.
   - **D: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target system.
     - Keylogging and browser credential theft can be part of the collection process, but the primary focus here is on obtaining credentials, which is more closely aligned with credential access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the initial process killing to evade detections, followed by keylogging and browser credential theft, which are directly related to the **Credential Access** tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
