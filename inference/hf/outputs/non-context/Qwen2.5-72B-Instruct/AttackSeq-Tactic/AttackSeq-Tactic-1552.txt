### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers used a backdoor to shut down the victim's computer, causing disruption and loss of system availability.
   - The key action here is the use of a backdoor to shut down the computer, which is an impact on the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves the use of a backdoor to cause a shutdown, which is an impact on the system.
   - We need to determine what tactic would logically precede this impact.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the methods used to gain entry into the victim's network or system. This is typically the first step in an attack.
     - While initial access is necessary, it is not the most immediate precursor to the shutdown action.
   - **B: Impact**
     - Impact is the final stage where the attacker achieves their goal, such as disrupting operations or causing damage.
     - The shutdown of the computer is an impact, so this cannot be the tactic that occurred before the impact.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that allow the attacker to maintain access to the system over time.
     - Establishing persistence is often a step taken after initial access and before the final impact. It ensures the attacker can return to the system and perform further actions.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing data from the victim's system and transferring it to the attacker's control.
     - While exfiltration is a common tactic, it is not directly related to the shutdown of the system and is typically a separate goal.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is that the attackers first gained initial access, then established persistence to maintain control, and finally used the backdoor to cause the impact (shutdown).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the impact is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: C: Persistence
