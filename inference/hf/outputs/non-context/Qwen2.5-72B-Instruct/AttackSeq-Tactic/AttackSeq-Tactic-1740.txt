### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used a PowerShell script to install LightNeuron on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - After the installation, LightNeuron executed functions to determine system network configurations using `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Installation of LightNeuron using a PowerShell script.
   - **Subsequent Action:** LightNeuron gathering system network configurations.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which aligns with the installation of LightNeuron using a PowerShell script. However, it does not specifically address the gathering of system network configurations.
   - **B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which could include network configurations. However, the term "Collection" is more commonly used for gathering data for exfiltration, not for reconnaissance.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network, which aligns perfectly with the use of `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` to determine system network configurations.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While it might be a necessary step before gathering system information, the question specifically asks about the action that occurred after the installation of LightNeuron.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the installation of LightNeuron, the attackers used the Discovery tactic to gather system network configurations.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
