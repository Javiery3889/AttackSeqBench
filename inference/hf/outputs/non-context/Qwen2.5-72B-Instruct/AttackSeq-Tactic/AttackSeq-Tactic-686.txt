### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have already infected servers and are using these servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.
   - The key phrase is "spread manually across the network," which indicates that the attackers are moving from one system to another within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the network. Since the question states that the servers are already infected, this tactic has already occurred and is not the next step.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's presence. The phrase "spread manually across the network" directly aligns with the concept of lateral movement.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems. While C2 is important, the question specifically mentions spreading across the network, which is more aligned with lateral movement.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While execution is a critical step, the question is about the movement across the network, not the execution of the trojan itself.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
