### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat group FIN7.
   - The sequence includes gaining admin privileges using RunPsExec, installing a PowerShell RAT, and exfiltrating data using SmartFTP Client.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between gaining admin privileges and exfiltrating data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gaining admin privileges using RunPsExec.
   - **Intermediate Action:** Installing a PowerShell RAT.
   - **Final Action:** Exfiltrating data using SmartFTP Client.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim network. This could be a plausible intermediate step, as the attacker might need to collect data before exfiltrating it.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain further access. This is less likely to occur after gaining admin privileges, as the attacker already has elevated access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this could be relevant, it is not the most likely intermediate step in the sequence described.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim network. This is a common step after gaining initial access and before exfiltrating data, as the attacker needs to understand the network to find valuable data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence, the most logical intermediate step is to **collect** the data before exfiltrating it. The attacker would need to identify and gather the data they want to steal before using SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate it.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Collection
