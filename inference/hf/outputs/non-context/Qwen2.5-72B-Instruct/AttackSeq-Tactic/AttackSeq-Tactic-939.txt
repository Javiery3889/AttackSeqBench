### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Tropic Trooper group.
   - Initial access was gained by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation Editor.
   - An installer package was downloaded.
   - A BITSadmin job was created to launch the sidebar.exe file, which then executed malicious actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting the Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** Downloading and running the installer package.
   - **Persistence:** Creating a BITSadmin job to ensure the malicious actions are executed.
   - **Execution:** Launching the sidebar.exe file to perform the malicious actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it typically occurs before initial access is gained. The question already states that initial access has been achieved, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. Creating a BITSadmin job to ensure the sidebar.exe file is executed is a form of persistence. However, the question asks what occurred before the backdoor installer created the BITSadmin job.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running the malicious code. Downloading and running the installer package is an execution step. This aligns with the sequence described in the question, as it occurs before the creation of the BITSadmin job.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands and exfiltrate data. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after the initial execution and persistence mechanisms are in place.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is: Initial Access → Execution (downloading and running the installer package) → Persistence (creating the BITSadmin job) → Execution (launching the sidebar.exe file).
   - The question asks what occurred before the backdoor installer created the BITSadmin job, which is the persistence step.
   - Therefore, the most likely answer is the execution step, where the installer package was downloaded and run.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
