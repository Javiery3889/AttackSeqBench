### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlackEnergy 3 malware leveraged a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 to target Ukrainian power facilities.
   - The key point is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the initial exploitation of the vulnerability.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013, which falls under the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - We need to determine what typically happens next in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to execute the malware on the target system. This is a common follow-up action to ensure the malware can perform its intended functions.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This is the initial step of the attack, not what happens after the initial access has been achieved.
   - **C: Discovery** - While discovery can occur after initial access, it is not the immediate next step. Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment, which typically happens after the malware is executed.
   - **D: Persistence** - Persistence involves ensuring the malware remains on the system even after a reboot or other disruptions. This is a later step in the attack sequence, often after the malware has been executed and has established a foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence starts with **Initial Access** (exploiting the vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013).
   - The next logical step is **Execution** of the malware to carry out its intended functions.
   - **Discovery** and **Persistence** are subsequent steps but not the immediate next step after initial access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Execution
