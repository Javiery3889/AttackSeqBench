### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a Shellbot.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Hardcoded process names to evade detection** (Tactic: Defense Evasion)
     - **Establishing communication with C&C servers using an IRC channel** (Tactic: Command and Control)

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. This typically happens after initial access and before more advanced actions like lateral movement or exfiltration. However, it is not a necessary step between evading detection and establishing C&C communication.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic where the attacker establishes communication with the compromised system to control it. This is the next logical step after evading detection and before any further actions like lateral movement or exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through the network to access other systems. This typically happens after establishing C2 and is not a necessary step between evading detection and establishing C2.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the compromised system. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and would not occur before establishing C2.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the botnet established communication with the C&C servers using an IRC channel immediately after evading detection by system admins. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
