### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the RTM APT group gains initial access through phishing emails or exploiting unprotected resources.
   - After gaining initial access, the group uses packers as a service to complicate detection by security tools.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The group gains access through phishing emails or exploiting unprotected resources.
   - **Next Step:** The group uses packers as a service to complicate detection by security tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While it is a crucial step in many attack sequences, it does not directly relate to the use of packers to complicate detection.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the first step. The use of packers as a service occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools. Using packers as a service to complicate detection aligns well with this tactic.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of using packers to complicate detection after gaining access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the RTM APT group used packers as a service to complicate detection by security tools, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
