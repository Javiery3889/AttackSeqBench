### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by creating a service named `msupdate2` and copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll`.
   - After ensuring persistence, the backdoor performs system information and file discovery.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor creates a service and copies itself to a specific directory to ensure it remains on the system.
   - **System Information and File Discovery:** The backdoor then gathers information about the system and discovers files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The ATT&CK tactic "Discovery" involves the adversary attempting to understand the system and network environment. This includes gathering system information and discovering files, which aligns with the described behavior of the Milestone backdoor.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - The ATT&CK tactic "Persistence" involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold on a system. This has already been described in the question (creating a service and copying itself), so this is not the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - The ATT&CK tactic "Defense Evasion" involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions system information and file discovery, which is more aligned with the "Discovery" tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - The ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access" involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials. This is not mentioned in the question, so it is not the most plausible next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after ensuring persistence, the Milestone backdoor performs system information and file discovery, which falls under the "Discovery" tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
