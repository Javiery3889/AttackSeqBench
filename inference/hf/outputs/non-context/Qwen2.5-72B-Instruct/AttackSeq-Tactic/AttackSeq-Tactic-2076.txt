### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before BlackSoul communicated with the C2 server over the RESTful Strapi protocol to execute commands and upload gathered files.
   - The key elements here are:
     - Communication with the C2 server.
     - Execution of commands.
     - Uploading gathered files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a victim's system. This is a fundamental step in many attack sequences, but it typically occurs before the attacker establishes communication with a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by communicating with it. This is the tactic that directly involves communication with the C2 server, which is mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This typically occurs after initial access and command and control have been established.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This can occur after command and control is established, but it is not a prerequisite for communication with the C2 server.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions communication with the C2 server, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.
   - Before the attacker can execute commands and upload files, they must first establish communication with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the execution of commands and uploading of files.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
