### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where WinDealer achieves persistence through the registry's RUN key.
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains a foothold in the target system.
   - **Persistence:** This is the step where the attacker ensures that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot or other disruptions.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the initial delivery of malware.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware on the system, which is a step that typically follows initial access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack, which is not directly related to the delivery of malware.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the system, which is the most relevant to delivering malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is a common vector for initial access. Attackers can exploit this mechanism to deliver malware to the target system.
   - Once the malware is delivered, it can then achieve persistence through the registry's RUN key.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
