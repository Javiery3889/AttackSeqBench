### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an initial access is gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable.
   - The next step involves TDrop2 malware using process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the process hollowing.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through a trojanized legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Process Hollowing:** TDrop2 malware injects malicious code into a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code. While this is part of the attack, it is not the most specific tactic that fits the sequence before process hollowing.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. Process hollowing is a technique under the Defense Evasion tactic, so this is a strong candidate.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future operations. While reconnaissance might occur earlier in the attack, it is not the most immediate step before process hollowing.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack. This is typically an early stage and not directly related to the immediate steps before process hollowing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained through a trojanized executable, which is part of the Initial Access tactic.
   - After gaining access, the next logical step is to evade detection to maintain persistence and avoid being caught.
   - Process hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the process hollowing is Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
