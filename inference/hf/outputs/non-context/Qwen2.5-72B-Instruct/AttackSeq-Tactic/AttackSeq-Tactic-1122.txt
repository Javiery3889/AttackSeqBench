### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where APT42 first engages in social engineering efforts to gather information on targets (reconnaissance).
   - After this, APT42 gains initial access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance**: Engaging in social engineering efforts to gather information on targets.
   - **Initial Access**: Gaining access through spear phishing and credential harvesting techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker exploring the network and systems to understand the environment after gaining access. This is not a pre-access activity.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system, which typically happens after gaining access. This is not a pre-access activity.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is the initial phase where the attacker gathers information about the target. This aligns with the social engineering efforts described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources (e.g., infrastructure, tools) before the attack. While this is a pre-attack phase, it is not specifically about gathering information on the target.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question explicitly states that APT42 engaged in social engineering efforts to gather information on targets, which is a clear indication of the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The Reconnaissance phase logically precedes the Initial Access phase, where the attacker uses the gathered information to gain access through spear phishing and credential harvesting.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
