### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Sofacy employed phishing emails and zero-day exploits like CVE-2015-3043 for delivering malware.
   - The key elements here are "phishing emails" and "zero-day exploits" which are both methods used to gain initial access to a target system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion is a crucial part of an attack, it typically occurs after gaining initial access to the system.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. Phishing emails and zero-day exploits are common methods for initial access.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a network. Persistence is usually established after gaining initial access.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. Command and control is typically established after gaining initial access and setting up persistence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that phishing emails and zero-day exploits are methods used to gain initial access to a target system, the most logical sequence is that the Initial Access tactic occurred before these methods were employed.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
