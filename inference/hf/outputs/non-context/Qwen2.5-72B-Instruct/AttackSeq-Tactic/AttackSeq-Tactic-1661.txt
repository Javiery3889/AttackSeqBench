### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware actors have already collected email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI.
   - The next step in the sequence is that the collected data is being sent to the attackers' infrastructure through a POST web request.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection:** The initial step of collecting email accounts using Microsoft Outlook MAPI falls under the "Collection" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Exfiltration:** The subsequent step of sending the collected data to the attackers' infrastructure through a POST web request falls under the "Exfiltration" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system, which is not relevant to the described sequence where data is already being collected and exfiltrated.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is not directly related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data from the compromised system to the attacker's infrastructure, which aligns with the described sequence.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is the initial step but not the one being asked about in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
