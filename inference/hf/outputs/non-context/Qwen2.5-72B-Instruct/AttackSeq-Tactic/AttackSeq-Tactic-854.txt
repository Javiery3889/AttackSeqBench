### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where macros are enabled, payloads are executed, and then a backdoor function gathers machine information and sends it to a C&C server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the execution of the payload and the gathering of machine information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Step 1:** Enabling macros.
   - **Step 2:** Execution of payloads.
   - **Step 3:** Backdoor function gathers machine information.
   - **Step 4:** Information is sent to the C&C server.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not the most likely step between payload execution and information gathering.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems. This is typically a step that occurs after initial access and before or during the execution of the payload, but not necessarily between payload execution and information gathering.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This is a logical step after the payload is executed and before the backdoor function gathers machine information. The adversary needs to discover what information is available and how to gather it.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. This is the step where the payload is executed, which has already been mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the payload is executed, the adversary would use Discovery techniques to gather information about the system before the backdoor function gathers and sends the information to the C&C server.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
