### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Tickusb.
   - The sequence is: Infection via USB flash drives → (Unknown Tactic) → Evading detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The infection via USB flash drives is an initial access technique.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Evading detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot is a defense evasion technique.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network. This is typically done after gaining initial access but before more advanced techniques like defense evasion.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is already mentioned as the infection via USB flash drives, so this cannot be the answer.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious code on the system. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. This is often done after initial access and execution but before defense evasion.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is: Initial Access (infection via USB flash drives) → Execution (running the malicious code) → Defense Evasion (altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Execution
