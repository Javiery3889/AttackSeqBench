### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where a file named "vba_macro.exe" is executed via the Shell command.
   - The focus is on ensuring that the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The execution of "vba_macro.exe" via the Shell command is an initial step.
   - The goal is to ensure that the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system or network. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle but does not ensure that the dropper is executed on every startup.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is not related to ensuring that a dropper is executed on every startup.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing communication between the attacker and the compromised system. While important, it does not directly ensure that the dropper is executed on every startup.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that ensure the attacker's tools or malware remain on the system even after a reboot. This is directly related to ensuring that the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs that ensures the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
