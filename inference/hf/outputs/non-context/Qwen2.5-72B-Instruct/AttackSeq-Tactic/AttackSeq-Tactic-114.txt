### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Charming Kitten gained initial access to victims' accounts using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages impersonating Google Drive and other services.
   - The key phrase here is "before Charming Kitten gained initial access."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Some action (to be determined) occurred.
     2. Charming Kitten gained initial access using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the target, such as network structure, user accounts, and system configurations. This is typically done after gaining initial access to understand the environment better.
     - This does not fit the sequence because it occurs after initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the attacker gaining the first foothold in the target's environment. This is exactly what the question describes (spear-phishing emails and SMS messages).
     - This is the tactic that is already described in the question, so it cannot be the answer to what occurred before it.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves the attacker taking steps to maintain their access to the target's environment. This is typically done after gaining initial access.
     - This does not fit the sequence because it occurs after initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves the attacker preparing the necessary resources and infrastructure to conduct the attack, such as setting up phishing domains, creating malicious documents, and developing social engineering techniques.
     - This fits the sequence because it is a preparatory step that occurs before the attacker gains initial access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Charming Kitten first developed the necessary resources (Resource Development) before using spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gain initial access.

**Final Answer: D: Resource Development**
