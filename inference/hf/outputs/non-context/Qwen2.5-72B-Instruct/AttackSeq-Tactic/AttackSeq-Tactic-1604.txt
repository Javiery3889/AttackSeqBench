### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the Freakyshelly targeted attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Identifying installed software through GET requests sent by Microsoft Word.
     - Bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred prior to the bypass.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include spear-phishing, drive-by compromises, or other methods to initially compromise a system.
     - While Initial Access is a crucial first step, the question implies that the adversary has already gained some level of access to the system to send GET requests and use an undocumented Word feature. Therefore, Initial Access is less likely to be the tactic that occurred immediately prior to the bypass.

   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This could include identifying installed software, network topology, and other system details.
     - The question mentions identifying installed software through GET requests, which aligns with the Discovery tactic. This suggests that the adversary was gathering information about the system before attempting to bypass detection.

   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to access systems and accounts. This could include keylogging, credential dumping, or other methods to steal credentials.
     - The question does not mention any activities related to stealing or using credentials. Therefore, Credential Access is less likely to be the tactic that occurred immediately prior to the bypass.

   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. This could include using undocumented features, obfuscation, or other methods to bypass security measures.
     - The question mentions bypassing detection by using an undocumented Word feature, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic. However, the question asks what occurred prior to the bypass, not what the bypass itself is.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the adversary identifying installed software through GET requests, which is a clear indication of the Discovery tactic.
   - After discovering the installed software, the adversary then uses an undocumented Word feature to bypass detection, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the Discovery tactic occurred prior to the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
