### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Tortoiseshell group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Maintaining persistence using a RAT (Remote Access Tool) named 'IvizTech'.
     - Using a reconnaissance tool named 'bird.exe' to collect detailed information about the victim's machine.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) from the victim. While this could be part of the attack, it is not necessarily the next step after maintaining persistence and before reconnaissance.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the victim's system and network. This aligns well with the use of the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' to collect detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **C: Impact**
     - This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not the most likely next step after maintaining persistence and before reconnaissance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used the 'bird.exe' tool for **Discovery** after maintaining persistence with the RAT 'IvizTech'.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
