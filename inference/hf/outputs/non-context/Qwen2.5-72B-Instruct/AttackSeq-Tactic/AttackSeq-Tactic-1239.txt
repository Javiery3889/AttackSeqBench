### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where WhiteBear gains initial access through spearphishing with malicious PDF files.
   - After gaining initial access, a binary loader injects code into "explorer.exe" using the KernelInjector subsystem.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the system, typically through spearphishing.
   - **Code Injection:** This is the step where the binary loader injects code into "explorer.exe."

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, but it does not describe the code injection into "explorer.exe."
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not relevant to the code injection described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code, which aligns with the binary loader injecting code into "explorer.exe."
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves sending data out of the network, which is not relevant to the code injection described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that the binary loader injecting code into "explorer.exe" falls under the **Execution** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
