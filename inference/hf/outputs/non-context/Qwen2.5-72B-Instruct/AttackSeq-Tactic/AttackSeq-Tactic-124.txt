### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Infamous Chisel executed shell scripts as the root user by replacing the legitimate `netd` system binary.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The execution of shell scripts as the root user by replacing a legitimate system binary is an example of the **Execution** tactic.
   - We need to identify what typically happens before the **Execution** tactic in an attack sequence.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The **Impact** tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This typically occurs after the attacker has already gained control and executed their payloads.
     - This is not a plausible candidate for what happens before **Execution**.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - The **Initial Access** tactic involves techniques that attackers use to gain an initial foothold in a network, such as phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities.
     - This is a plausible candidate, but it is typically the first step in the attack sequence, not immediately before **Execution**.
   - **C: Execution**
     - The **Execution** tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on the target system.
     - This is the tactic described in the question, so it cannot be the answer to what happened before it.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - The **Persistence** tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network, such as creating new accounts or modifying system files.
     - Replacing a legitimate system binary (like `netd`) to execute shell scripts as the root user is a form of persistence. This is a plausible candidate for what happens before the execution of the shell scripts.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first established persistence by replacing the `netd` binary, and then used this modified binary to execute shell scripts as the root user.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the shell scripts is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
