### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker interacts with a Mattermost server to collect and communicate system information and then communicates system details and screenshots to the same server.
   - The key points are:
     - Interaction with a Mattermost server to collect system information.
     - Communication of system details and screenshots to the same server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this might be a step in the attack, it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a target system to an attacker-controlled system. The communication of system details and screenshots to the Mattermost server fits this description.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. The interaction with the Mattermost server to collect and communicate system information suggests C2 activities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. The question does not mention moving to other systems, so this is less likely.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves the attacker using the Mattermost server to both collect and communicate system information and to exfiltrate data (system details and screenshots).
   - The primary focus is on the communication and exfiltration of data, which aligns most closely with the Exfiltration tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
