### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Process Discovery**: Identifying running processes on the system.
     - **System Information Discovery**: Gathering information about the system, such as OS version, installed software, etc.
     - **System Time Discovery**: Determining the current system time.
   - The gathered information is then archived using a custom storage file format.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. The TTPs mentioned (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) are typically performed after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **B: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the system. While the TTPs mentioned are part of the data collection process, they are more specifically related to the discovery phase.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing malware or creating infrastructure. The TTPs mentioned are not related to resource development.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network to aid in further actions. The TTPs mentioned (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) are all part of the discovery phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The TTPs described in the question (process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery) are all part of the **Discovery** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. After gathering this information, the next logical step would be to use it for further actions, such as collection or lateral movement.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
