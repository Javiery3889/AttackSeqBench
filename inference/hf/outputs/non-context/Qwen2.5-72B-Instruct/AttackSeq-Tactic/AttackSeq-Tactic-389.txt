### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where VBA macros within a malicious Word document are executed.
   - After the execution of these macros, scripts from watering hole attacks begin communicating with external servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malicious Word document is likely the initial vector for gaining access to the system.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macros are executed, which is the next step in the attack.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The scripts from the watering hole attacks begin communicating with external servers, which is a typical C2 activity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is a valid step in the attack sequence, but it refers to the execution of the VBA macros, which has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - This refers to the final stage of the attack where the adversary achieves their goal (e.g., data exfiltration, system destruction). The question does not indicate that this stage has been reached yet.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This is the most appropriate choice because the scripts are communicating with external servers, which is a clear indication of C2 activity.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - This refers to the initial entry point, which in this case is the malicious Word document. The question is asking about the next step after the execution of the VBA macros.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
