### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Grandoreiro, a known malware, collects victim information such as computer name, username, and installed security products.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next, involving operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval from its C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Collection of victim information (Discovery).
   - **Next Step:** Communication and command retrieval over HTTP (Command and Control).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a common next step after initial access, it does not directly involve communication over HTTP with a C&C server.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. The question already states that this step has been completed.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the C&C server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This aligns with the described operations over HTTP for communication and command retrieval.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves actions to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. It does not involve communication with a C&C server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
