### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Pierogi backdoor.
   - The actions include data collection (taking screenshots and executing commands via CMD shell).
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoor uploaded the collected data (machine information and screenshots) to predefined URLs.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Data Collection: Taking screenshots and executing commands via CMD shell.
   - Data Exfiltration: Uploading machine information and screenshots to predefined URLs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not directly related to the data collection and exfiltration described in the question.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the backdoor to control it. While C2 is necessary for the backdoor to receive commands, it is not the next step after data collection and before exfiltration.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data and sending it to an external location. This aligns perfectly with the described action of uploading machine information and screenshots to predefined URLs.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves establishing resources to support operations. It is not relevant to the data collection and exfiltration sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor collected data and then exfiltrated it. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the exfiltration is the exfiltration itself.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
