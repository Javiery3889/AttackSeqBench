### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where configuration files are decoded to issue new instructions for targeted DDoS attacks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions hard-coded into the sample.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Decoding configuration files.
     2. Issuing new instructions for DDoS attacks.
     3. KernelBot implants receiving targeting instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. This is typically done to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
     - While discovery is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not the most likely step immediately before the KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the actual attack. This includes identifying potential targets, vulnerabilities, and entry points.
     - Reconnaissance is a pre-attack phase and is not likely to occur immediately before the KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions.
   - **C: Impact**
     - Impact involves the actual execution of the attack, such as causing a DDoS attack. This is the final stage where the adversary's goal is realized.
     - The question describes the preparation for a DDoS attack, not the execution itself. Therefore, Impact is not the correct answer.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised system and issuing commands to the malware. This is a critical step in the attack lifecycle where the adversary can issue new instructions to the malware.
     - Decoding configuration files and issuing new instructions for DDoS attacks are actions that fall under the C2 tactic. The KernelBot implants receiving targeting instructions is a direct result of C2 activities.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the KernelBot implants received targeting instructions as part of the Command and Control phase. This is because the decoding of configuration files and the issuance of new instructions are actions that are typically performed by the adversary to control the malware and direct it to perform specific tasks, such as a DDoS attack.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
