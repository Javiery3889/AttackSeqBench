### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Luckycat establishes persistence using WMI to register a backdoor script.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely involved the exploitation of software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments before the persistence was established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the target system. Exploiting software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments is a common method for initial access.
   - **Persistence:** This is the step where the attacker ensures they can maintain access to the system over time. In this case, it involves using WMI to register a backdoor script.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the tactic used after gaining initial access to ensure the attacker can maintain access. It does not fit the description of exploiting software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the tactic that involves gaining the initial foothold in the target system. Exploiting software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments is a common method for initial access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This is the tactic where the attacker gathers information about the target before launching an attack. It does not involve exploiting software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This is the tactic where the attacker steals data from the target system. It does not fit the description of exploiting software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the exploitation of software vulnerabilities through malicious email attachments is part of the **Initial Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
