### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where malware has already collected files, keystrokes, and screenshots from the infected victim.
   - The next step in the sequence is the uploading of the stolen data to a C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure using HTTP connections.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the data was uploaded.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**:
     - The question already states that the malware has collected files, keystrokes, and screenshots. This means the "Collection" tactic has already been completed.
   - **B: Command and Control**:
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It is typically used to send commands to the malware and receive data from it. This is a plausible candidate because the malware needs to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to upload the data.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**:
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is a crucial part of many attack sequences, it is not directly related to the act of uploading data to a C2 server.
   - **D: Resource Development**:
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, such as setting up C2 servers. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware used the "Command and Control" tactic to communicate with the C2 infrastructure and upload the stolen data.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
