### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where data has been collected from an infected iOS device.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves managing communication with the attackers and enabling remote updates and module management.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is data collection, which is already mentioned.
   - The next step involves communication and remote management.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. Since the question already states that data has been collected, this is not the next step.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the context of managing communication and remote updates.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it, send commands, and manage the attack. This fits the description of managing communication and enabling remote updates and module management.
   - **D: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. While it is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the actual compromise and does not fit the context of managing an already infected device.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
