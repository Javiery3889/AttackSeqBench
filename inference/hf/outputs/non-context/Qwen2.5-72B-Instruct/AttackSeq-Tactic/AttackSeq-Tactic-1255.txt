### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The campaign started with reconnaissance activities targeting specific industries.
   - The goal of these activities was to develop access routes for further breaches through supply-chain attacks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The initial phase where the attackers gather information about the target industries.
   - **Resource Development:** This involves preparing the necessary resources to carry out the attack, such as developing malware or creating fake identities.
   - **Initial Access:** This is the phase where the attackers gain entry into the target network or system.
   - **Execution:** This involves running malicious code or commands on the target system to achieve the attacker's objectives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This is the initial phase and has already been mentioned in the question. It cannot be the next step.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This is a logical next step after reconnaissance. The attackers would need to develop the necessary resources to exploit the information gathered during reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This could also be a plausible next step, but it typically follows resource development. The attackers need to have the resources ready before they can gain initial access.
   - **Execution (D):** This is a later phase in the attack sequence and would not logically follow reconnaissance directly.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after reconnaissance, the attackers would develop the necessary resources to carry out the attack. This aligns with the logical progression of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

### Final Answer: B: Resource Development
