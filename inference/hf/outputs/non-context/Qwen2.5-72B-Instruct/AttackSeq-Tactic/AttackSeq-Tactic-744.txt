### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Gamaredon group used scripting (Batch files and VBScript) to execute payloads from C&C servers.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are scripting and execution of payloads from C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**:
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While scripting can be used for defense evasion, it is not the primary tactic that would occur before the execution of payloads.
   - **B: Execution**:
     - Execution is the tactic where the adversary runs malicious code on a system. This is the most direct and relevant tactic for the use of scripting to execute payloads from C&C servers.
   - **C: Initial Access**:
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the execution of payloads and scripting.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**:
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and executing initial payloads.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of scripting (Batch files and VBScript) to execute payloads from C&C servers is a clear example of the **Execution** tactic. Before the execution of these payloads, the adversary would have already gained initial access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the **Initial Access** tactic occurred before the execution of payloads using scripting.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
