### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before delivering the Taidoor malware via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     - Delivering Taidoor malware.
     - Using a spear-phishing email attachment.
     - Exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the target system after gaining initial access. This is not a prerequisite for delivering the malware via a spear-phishing email.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the attacker gaining entry into the target system. Delivering malware via a spear-phishing email is a common method of initial access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves the attacker gathering information about the target before attempting to gain access. This is a necessary step before crafting a spear-phishing email, as the attacker needs to know who to target and what type of attachment might be convincing.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain or maintain access to the system. This typically occurs after initial access has been gained.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker gathers information about the target to craft a convincing spear-phishing email.
     2. **Initial Access**: The attacker sends the spear-phishing email with the malicious attachment, which exploits the Microsoft Office vulnerability to deliver the Taidoor malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
