### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a dropper executable named 'NSC Press conference.exe' is executed.
   - This dropper opens a decoy document and deploys a backdoor to 'C:\users\public\spools.exe'.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Execution:** The dropper executable is run, which is the initial execution phase.
   - **Decoy Document:** A decoy document is opened to distract the user.
   - **Backdoor Deployment:** The backdoor is deployed to a specific location on the system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - Deploying a backdoor to a system location (e.g., 'C:\users\public\spools.exe') is a common method to achieve persistence.
     - This is a strong candidate because the backdoor is likely intended to maintain access to the system.

   - **B: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access.
     - While lateral movement could occur after persistence, it is not the immediate next step after deploying a backdoor.
     - This is less likely to be the immediate next step.

   - **C: Execution:**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on a target.
     - The initial execution of the dropper has already occurred, so this is not the next step.
     - This is not a plausible next step.

   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - Credential access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords.
     - While credential access could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after deploying a backdoor.
     - This is less likely to be the immediate next step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step after deploying a backdoor is to ensure that the backdoor persists on the system.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic to occur next is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
