### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where DarkHydrus initially gains access using spear-phishing emails with malicious Excel Web Query files.
   - After gaining initial access, RogueRobin establishes persistence by creating a OneDrive.bat file and modifying itself for execution on user login.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** DarkHydrus gains access via spear-phishing emails with malicious Excel Web Query files.
   - **Persistence:** RogueRobin creates a OneDrive.bat file and modifies itself for execution on user login.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, user accounts, and system configurations. This typically occurs after gaining initial access but before establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the system. This is often necessary before establishing persistence but is not a prerequisite.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves the attacker running malicious code on the target system. This is a critical step after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence, which is already described as occurring via spear-phishing emails with malicious Excel Web Query files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access:** DarkHydrus gains access via spear-phishing emails.
     2. **Execution:** The malicious Excel Web Query files are executed on the target system.
     3. **Persistence:** RogueRobin creates a OneDrive.bat file and modifies itself for execution on user login.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and establishing persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Execution
