### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Rising Sun implant has already established communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
   - The next step involves sending encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** The implant has established communication with control servers.
   - **Next Step:** The implant sends encrypted and obfuscated data to these control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after establishing communication.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. Establishing communication and sending data to control servers aligns well with the C2 phase.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While this is a crucial step, it is not the immediate next step after establishing communication and sending data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the implant sending data to control servers after establishing communication. This aligns most closely with the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic, as it involves the ongoing communication and control of the compromised system by the attacker.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
