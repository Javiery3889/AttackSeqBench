### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where PROMETHIUM evades detection by performing checks for antivirus software.
   - It asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before this evasion, specifically involving the use of trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain a foothold.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Use of trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain a foothold.
   - **Subsequent Step:** Evasion by performing checks for antivirus software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this could be part of a broader attack, it does not directly align with the use of trojanized installation files to gain initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a network. Using trojanized installation files of well-known applications is a common method for initial access.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques to steal and transfer data out of a network. It is not relevant to the initial steps of gaining access or evading detection.
   - **D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While execution is a critical step, it typically follows initial access and is not the primary method for gaining a foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of trojanized installation files to gain a foothold is a clear indicator of the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to evade detection by checking for antivirus software.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access** using trojanized installation files.
     2. **Evasion** by performing checks for antivirus software.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Initial Access
