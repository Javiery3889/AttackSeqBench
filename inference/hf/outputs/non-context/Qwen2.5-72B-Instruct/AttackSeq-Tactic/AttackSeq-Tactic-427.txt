### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already established contact with C2 servers using legitimate websites like GitHub and has encoded binary files during command execution.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely follows this stage of the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Using legitimate websites like GitHub to establish contact with C2 servers.
     - **Command Execution:** Encoding binary files during command execution.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the victim's network to an external location.
     - After establishing C2 and executing commands, the next logical step could be to exfiltrate data, especially if the attacker has already gained the necessary access and control.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data.
     - While this could be a subsequent step, it is less likely to follow immediately after C2 and command execution, as the attacker would typically want to gather and exfiltrate data first.
   - **C: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack.
     - This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not logically follow the establishment of C2 and command execution.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment.
     - While discovery is a crucial step, it is often performed earlier in the attack lifecycle, before establishing C2 and command execution.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the sequence of TTPs described, the most logical next step after establishing C2 and executing commands would be to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
