### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the 'Surtr' malware:
     - Listed file directories.
     - Executed remote commands.
     - Logged keystrokes.
     - Connected to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloaded a stage two component.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and file directories. While listing file directories is a discovery action, the other actions (executing remote commands, logging keystrokes, and downloading a stage two component) do not fit this tactic.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the attacker gaining entry into the victim's network or system. The actions described (listing directories, executing commands, logging keystrokes) are not typical of initial access, which usually involves techniques like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system, such as keystrokes, files, and other sensitive information. While logging keystrokes and listing file directories are collection actions, the connection to a remote server and downloading a stage two component is more indicative of a different tactic.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. This includes establishing a communication channel with the attacker's server, which is exactly what is described in the question (connecting to internet.3-a.net on port 9696 and downloading a stage two component).

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
