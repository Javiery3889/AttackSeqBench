### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands, and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Lateral Movement**: Using Cobalt Strike Beacon to move between systems.
     - **Execution**: Executing commands on remote computers.
     - **Process Injection**: Injecting processes on remote computers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion might be part of the overall attack, it is not the most likely next step after lateral movement, execution, and process injection.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it is typically established before or during the initial compromise, not necessarily after lateral movement.
   - **C: Impact**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. Impact is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the attackers have achieved their objectives and are ready to cause damage.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. The question already states that lateral movement has occurred, so this is not the next step.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question describes the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands, and injecting processes, the most likely next step would be to maintain control over the compromised systems and potentially exfiltrate data or prepare for further actions.
   - The most plausible next step in this sequence is **Command and Control (C2)**, as the attackers would need to maintain communication with the compromised systems to continue their operations.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
