### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by adversaries.
   - The sequence includes developing infrastructure (botnet-linked IPs and malicious containers) and exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports to gain access to victim environments.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the exploitation of the misconfigured Docker API ports.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the attack, such as botnet-linked IPs and malicious containers. This is a preparatory step that occurs before the actual attack.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial entry into the victim's environment. Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports is a method of initial access.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions within the victim's environment. This typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it is not the immediate step before exploiting a misconfigured Docker API port.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question indicates that the adversaries first developed the necessary infrastructure (botnet-linked IPs and malicious containers).
   - After setting up the infrastructure, the next logical step would be to use that infrastructure to gain initial access to the victim's environment.
   - Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports is a method of initial access, which aligns with the tactic "Initial Access."

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
