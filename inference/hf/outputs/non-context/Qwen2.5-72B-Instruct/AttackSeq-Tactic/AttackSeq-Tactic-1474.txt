### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Duke group using the Trojan.Cozer malware.
   - The initial attack vector is via 'Office Monkeys'- and 'eFax'-themed emails.
   - The goal is to compromise high-profile government networks.
   - After the initial compromise, the group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server with compromised credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Compromise: Phishing emails with Trojan.Cozer.
   - Post-Compromise: Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords. Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks are a form of credential access, where the adversary uses stolen or forged Kerberos tickets to authenticate as a user.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. While email extraction is a form of exfiltration, it typically occurs after the adversary has already gained the necessary credentials and access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While defense evasion is important, it is not the primary focus of the described sequence.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. Discovery typically occurs after initial access but before more advanced actions like credential access and exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves initial compromise via phishing emails, followed by the use of Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction.
   - The Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks are a form of credential access, which is necessary to gain the credentials needed for email extraction.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the initial compromise and the email extraction is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Credential Access
