### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where IndigoZebra uses a dropper executable to open a document to reduce suspicion and then drops and executes a backdoor.
   - The key elements are:
     - Dropper executable
     - Opening a document to reduce suspicion
     - Dropping and executing a backdoor

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
     - **Reasoning:** The described sequence involves initial access and execution, not maintaining long-term access. Therefore, this is not the most likely tactic to occur before the described actions.

   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This can include spear-phishing, drive-by downloads, and other methods to execute code on a target system.
     - **Reasoning:** The dropper executable and the document opening to reduce suspicion are typical of initial access techniques. The adversary is trying to get the user to execute the dropper, which then drops the backdoor.

   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on the target system. This is a critical step after gaining initial access.
     - **Reasoning:** The described sequence involves the execution of the dropper and the backdoor. However, the question asks what likely occurred before this execution, which points to the initial access phase.

   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
     - **Reasoning:** The described sequence does not mention any attempts to gain higher-level permissions, so this is not the most likely tactic to occur before the described actions.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described involves the use of a dropper executable and a document to reduce suspicion, which are typical of initial access techniques.
   - The execution of the backdoor is a subsequent step, so the initial access must have occurred before this.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
