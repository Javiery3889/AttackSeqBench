### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where a backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques.
   - The next step in the sequence is to establish communication with the C2 (Command and Control) server via DNS tunneling.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and gather information about the environment. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining initial access to the network. This is usually the first step in an attack and does not align with the sequence described, where the backdoor is already present and has performed other actions.
   - **C: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves the adversary moving through the network to access additional systems. While this is a common next step after initial access, it does not align with the specific action of establishing communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. DNS tunneling is a technique used to communicate with the C2 server, which fits perfectly with the described sequence.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the backdoor program has already gathered host information and executed evasion techniques, is to establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling, which falls under the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
