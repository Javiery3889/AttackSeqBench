### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the SLUB backdoor.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery**: Downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet from GitHub for executable commands and retrieving the username and computer name.
     - **Exfiltration**: Uploading files to file.io and posting download links to a Slack channel.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: Exfiltration**: This is the final step in the sequence described, where data is uploaded to file.io and links are posted to a Slack channel.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which is described in the question as downloading and parsing a 'gist' snippet and retrieving the username and computer name.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is a critical step that often follows initial access and discovery, and precedes exfiltration.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events described in the question is:
     1. **Discovery**: The backdoor downloads and parses a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and retrieves the username and computer name.
     2. **Command and Control (C2)**: The backdoor likely receives commands from the attacker to perform further actions.
     3. **Exfiltration**: The backdoor uploads files to file.io and posts download links to a Slack channel.
   - The question asks which tactic occurred before the exfiltration. Given the sequence, the most logical step before exfiltration is the establishment of command and control to direct the backdoor to perform the exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
