### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a Remote Access Tool (RAT) has been executed as a service and has maintained persistence on the victim's system.
   - The RAT then communicates with a Command and Control (C2) server using an IP address argument to the service.
   - The communication with the C2 server complicates direct access for researchers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Execution as a Service:** This is part of the initial compromise and persistence.
   - **Maintaining Persistence:** The RAT is set up to ensure it remains on the system.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:** The RAT communicates with a C2 server using an IP address argument.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker trying to understand the environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. While this might occur after gaining access, it is not the primary focus of the described communication with the C2 server.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain further access. This is not directly related to the communication with the C2 server.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by communicating with it. The description of the RAT communicating with a C2 server using an IP address argument fits this tactic perfectly.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While this might be a subsequent step, it is not the focus of the communication with the C2 server.

### Final Reasoning
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the communication with the C2 server, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
