### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers:
     - Execute .NET binaries to load commercial RATs (Remote Access Trojans) like RevengeRAT.
     - Monitor booking websites for credit card data.
     - Sell credentials from compromised hotel systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Execution**: The attackers execute .NET binaries to load RATs.
   - **Persistence**: The RATs allow the attackers to maintain access to the compromised systems.
   - **Collection**: The attackers monitor booking websites for credit card data.
   - **Exfiltration**: The attackers exfiltrate the collected data.
   - **Credential Access**: The attackers obtain and sell credentials from the compromised hotel systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it is not the most likely tactic to occur immediately before selling credentials.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. It is important for initial reconnaissance but not directly related to the final step of selling credentials.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. This is the most relevant tactic because the question specifically mentions selling credentials from compromised hotel systems.
   - **D: Collection**: This tactic involves techniques to gather data. While it is part of the attack sequence, it is more related to the monitoring of booking websites for credit card data, not the final step of selling credentials.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
