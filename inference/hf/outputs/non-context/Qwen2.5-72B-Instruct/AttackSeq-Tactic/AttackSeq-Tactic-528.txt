### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Desert Falcons, a threat actor group.
   - The sequence includes distributing spear phishing emails and conducting targeted social engineering attacks to compromise victims.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Command and Control phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Distributing spear phishing emails.
     2. Conducting targeted social engineering attacks.
     3. Compromising victims.
     4. Command and Control using homemade backdoors.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**:
     - This tactic involves communicating with systems compromised by the threat actor. It is typically a later stage in the attack sequence, after the initial compromise.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**:
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access and control. It is also a later stage, typically after the initial compromise and command and control.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**:
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. It is often a step after the initial compromise but before or during command and control.
   - **D: Initial Access**:
     - This tactic involves the methods used to gain the initial foothold in the victim's environment. This includes techniques like spear phishing and social engineering.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with distributing spear phishing emails and conducting targeted social engineering attacks, which are techniques used for Initial Access.
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actors would then move to Command and Control to maintain and control the compromised systems.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
