### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the OceanLotus backdoor has successfully evaded defenses using robust string encoding and custom encryption to communicate with its command and control (C2) server.
   - The key point here is that the backdoor has already established communication with the C2 server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**:
     - This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
     - Given that the backdoor has already established communication with the C2 server, this is a logical next step in the attack sequence.
   - **B: Resource Development**:
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers, creating malware, and gathering information.
     - This typically occurs before the attack is launched, not after the backdoor has already established communication.
   - **C: Discovery**:
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gain information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts.
     - While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question specifically mentions communication with the C2 server, which is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **D: Execution**:
     - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on a target system to achieve their objectives.
     - Execution typically occurs earlier in the attack sequence, often as part of the initial compromise or as a result of a successful delivery mechanism.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible next step after the backdoor has established communication with the C2 server is the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
