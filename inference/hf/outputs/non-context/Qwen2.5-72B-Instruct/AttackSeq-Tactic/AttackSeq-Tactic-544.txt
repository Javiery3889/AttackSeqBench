### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a malicious XLS file with a VB macro that downloads and installs the SunSeed malware.
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. The VB macro is executed.
     2. The SunSeed malware is downloaded and installed.
     3. The malware establishes a Command and Control (C2) channel by issuing HTTP GET requests to a C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the execution of the VB macro and the establishment of the C2 channel.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This could happen after the malware is installed, but it is not necessarily a required step before establishing a C2 channel.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system. This typically occurs before the initial compromise, not after the malware is installed and before establishing a C2 channel.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malware. The VB macro execution and the installation of the SunSeed malware are already part of the execution phase. Therefore, this is not a plausible choice for the step between the installation and the C2 channel establishment.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the malware remains on the system after the initial infection. This is a logical step to take after the malware is installed and before establishing a C2 channel, as the attacker would want to ensure the malware remains on the system for long-term control.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events and the logical flow of TTPs, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the VB macro executed and the SunSeed malware was installed, but before the C2 channel was established, is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
