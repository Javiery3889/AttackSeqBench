### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Lazarus Group.
   - The sequence starts with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers that activate macros on victims' home computers.
   - The sequence ends with the execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malicious documents containing job offers that activate macros are used to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Execution:** The execution of malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the malicious documents are delivered and the macros are activated. This is not the tactic that occurs after the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where the malicious code is executed using system utilities and the backdoor. This is not the tactic that occurs before the execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the victim's system. It is a plausible step that could occur after gaining initial access and before executing the malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not necessarily the most immediate step after gaining initial access and before executing the malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with the delivery of malicious documents (Initial Access).
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely attempt to gather credentials to maintain persistence and further their access (Credential Access).
   - Once they have the necessary credentials, they can then execute the malicious code using system utilities and the backdoor (Execution).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
