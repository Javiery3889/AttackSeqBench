### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Tuyul botnet maintains persistence through a periodically downloaded bash script named 'cron'.
   - The focus is on what happens after the botnet has already established persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The botnet has already achieved persistence using a cron job to periodically download a bash script.
   - The question asks what the next ATT&CK tactic is likely to be.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion can occur after persistence, it is not the most immediate next step in the sequence described.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. After establishing persistence, the next logical step is to establish or maintain command and control to manage the botnet.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain initial access to a system. Since the botnet has already established persistence, initial access has already occurred and is not the next step.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a system. The question states that persistence has already been established, so this is not the next step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step after establishing persistence is to establish or maintain command and control to manage the botnet.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
