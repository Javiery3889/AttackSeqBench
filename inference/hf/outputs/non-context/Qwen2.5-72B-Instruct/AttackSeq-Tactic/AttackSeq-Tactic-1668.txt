### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where data exfiltration via encoded HTTP cookie data and other transport channels is the final step.
   - It asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely enabled Regin to use various remote access Trojan (RAT) features such as capturing screenshots and stealing passwords.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using RAT features (capturing screenshots, stealing passwords).
     2. Exfiltrating data via encoded HTTP cookie data and other transport channels.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - While persistence is important for maintaining long-term access, it does not directly enable the use of RAT features like capturing screenshots or stealing passwords.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
     - C2 is crucial for controlling the RAT and issuing commands to perform actions like capturing screenshots and stealing passwords.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information from the target network.
     - While collection is related to gathering data, it does not directly enable the use of RAT features.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network.
     - Discovery is important for understanding the environment but does not directly enable the use of RAT features.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The use of RAT features such as capturing screenshots and stealing passwords requires the adversary to have control over the system.
   - The ability to control the system and issue commands to the RAT is a function of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that enabled Regin to use these RAT features is Command and Control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
