### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing backdoor malware embedded within trusted software.
     - Gathering information and credentials on Windows systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the execution of the backdoor malware and **before** the gathering of information and credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it.
     - While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it typically occurs after the initial execution of the malware and is often a continuous process throughout the attack.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security tools and processes.
     - Defense evasion can occur at various stages of the attack, but it is not the primary focus between executing the malware and gathering information.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment and identify potential targets.
     - Discovery is a logical next step after the malware is executed and before the attacker starts gathering specific information and credentials.
   - **D: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources (e.g., infrastructure, tools) before the attack.
     - Resource development is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Execute backdoor malware.
     2. (Unknown tactic).
     3. Gather information and credentials.
   - The most logical step between executing the malware and gathering information and credentials is **Discovery**. The attacker needs to understand the environment and identify potential targets before gathering specific information and credentials.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **C: Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
