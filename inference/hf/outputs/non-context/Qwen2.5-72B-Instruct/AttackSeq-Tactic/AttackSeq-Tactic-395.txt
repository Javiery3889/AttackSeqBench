### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the initial stages of MuddyWater's attack, specifically mentioning the use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents.
   - The focus is on the initial compromise of systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. While C2 is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs after the initial compromise.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to gain the initial foothold in the target network. Using GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents aligns well with this tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While tools like PS2EXE and Invoke-Obfuscation are used for defense evasion, the question specifically mentions the initial compromise.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, the question focuses on the initial compromise, not the information-gathering phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes the use of GitHub-hosted custom backdoors and region-specific malicious documents to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - These methods are clearly aligned with the **Initial Access** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The other answer choices (Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Reconnaissance) do not fit as well with the described initial compromise.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
