### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Privilege escalation using DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
     - Using Mimikatz for credential theft.
     - Accessing Visma's Active Directory domain controller.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (DLL Sideloading):** This is the initial step where the attacker gains higher privileges on the system.
   - **Using Mimikatz for Credential Theft:** This is a technique used to steal credentials, which is part of the "Credential Access" tactic.
   - **Accessing Active Directory Domain Controller:** This is typically done after obtaining the necessary credentials to gain access to sensitive systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. It is typically a later step in the attack sequence, not something that occurs between privilege escalation and credential theft.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz. This is a logical step between privilege escalation and accessing the Active Directory domain controller.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a common step in many attacks, it is not the most logical step between privilege escalation and credential theft in this specific sequence.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. While it is a common step, it is typically done earlier in the attack sequence, not between privilege escalation and credential theft.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Credential Access
