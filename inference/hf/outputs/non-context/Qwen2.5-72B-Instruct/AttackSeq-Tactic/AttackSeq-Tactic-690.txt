### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a backdoor performs persistence checks and writes startup items.
   - It then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the backdoor gathered host information on the target system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence Checks and Writing Startup Items:** These actions are part of the **Persistence** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The backdoor is ensuring that it can maintain access to the system over time.
   - **Gathering Host Information:** This action is part of the **Discovery** tactic, where the backdoor collects information about the system to understand its environment and plan further actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this is a common early step in many attacks, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to access other systems. This is typically done after initial access and discovery, not before gathering host information.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most likely step immediately before gathering host information.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to a system. The question explicitly mentions that the backdoor performed persistence checks and wrote startup items, which are part of the Persistence tactic. Therefore, the Persistence tactic has already occurred.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the backdoor has already performed persistence actions, the next logical step before gathering host information would be to ensure that the persistence mechanisms are in place. This means that the Persistence tactic has already been completed.
   - The most likely tactic to occur before gathering host information, given the context, is **Defense Evasion**. The backdoor might need to evade defenses to ensure it can gather host information without being detected.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
