### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where privilege escalation is achieved using the Metasploit module `ext_server_priv.x86.dll`.
   - After privilege escalation, additional shellcode is downloaded via communication with a C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The initial step is the use of the Metasploit module to escalate privileges.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:** The next step involves downloading additional shellcode from a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It is a logical step after privilege escalation, as the attacker needs to communicate with the C&C server to download additional shellcode.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location. It is not relevant to the described sequence, as the question does not mention data exfiltration.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic has already been completed in the described sequence. It is not the next step.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C&C servers. It is typically a pre-attack phase and not relevant to the described sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after privilege escalation, the next step is to establish command and control to download additional shellcode.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
