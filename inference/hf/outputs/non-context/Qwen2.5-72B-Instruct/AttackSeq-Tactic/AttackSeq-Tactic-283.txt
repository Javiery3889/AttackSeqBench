### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where cybercriminals used leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering.
   - The task is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial intelligence gathering.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial TTP is the use of leaked-data search engines for intelligence gathering, which falls under the **Reconnaissance** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt business processes or deny access to resources. It is typically a later stage in an attack, not immediately following reconnaissance.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the theft of data from a network. While it can occur after reconnaissance, it is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed to support an attack. It can occur after reconnaissance but is more about setting up the necessary tools and infrastructure.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to support future operations. Since the question already states that reconnaissance has occurred, it is not a plausible next step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After gathering intelligence through reconnaissance, the next logical step for cybercriminals is to develop the resources and infrastructure needed to carry out the attack. This includes setting up command and control servers, creating malware, and other preparatory activities.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Resource Development
