### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the RIG EK (Exploit Kit) gained initial access through malvertising and redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript.
   - The key elements here are "before RIG EK gained initial access" and the methods used (malvertising and redirecting users).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating or acquiring tools, and gathering information.
     - This could include setting up the malvertising campaign and the compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to the target system, such as phishing, drive-by compromises, and exploit kits.
     - The question already states that RIG EK gained initial access through malvertising and redirecting users, so this is the tactic that occurs during the attack, not before it.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the methods used to steal and transfer data from the target system to the attacker's system.
     - This would occur after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.
   - **D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the methods used to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data to achieve the attacker's goals.
     - This would also occur after gaining initial access and possibly after exfiltration.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first needs to **Resource Development** to set up the malvertising campaign and the compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript. This preparation is necessary before the RIG EK can gain initial access through these methods.

### Final Answer: A: Resource Development
