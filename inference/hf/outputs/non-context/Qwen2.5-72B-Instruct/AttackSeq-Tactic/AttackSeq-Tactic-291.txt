### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C (Command and Control) traffic and communicates with the C&C server via Tor.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the stolen data being sent to the C&C server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**:
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it is already mentioned in the question (encrypting C&C traffic and communicating via Tor). Therefore, it is not the next step.
   - **B: Discovery**:
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the network, system, and environment. While discovery is important, it typically occurs before the data is exfiltrated.
   - **C: Exfiltration**:
     - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data and sending it to an external location, which in this case is the C&C server. This aligns perfectly with the next step described in the question.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**:
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is a pre-attack phase and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the stolen data was exfiltrated to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
