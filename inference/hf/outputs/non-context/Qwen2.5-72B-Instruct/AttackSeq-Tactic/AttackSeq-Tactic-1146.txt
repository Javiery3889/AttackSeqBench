### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Turla group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Bypassing antimalware scanning capabilities through AMSI patching.
     - Using backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives within the victim's network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**:
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle. The question mentions gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives, which are collection activities. However, this is not the step that occurs before using backdoors.
   - **B: Discovery**:
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a crucial step before an attacker can effectively use backdoors to gather specific information.
   - **C: Impact**:
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of the victim's systems, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Persistence**:
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to the victim's system over time, often through the use of backdoors or other mechanisms. While persistence is a critical step, it is not the step that occurs before gathering file and directory information or monitoring USB drives.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     - Bypassing antimalware scanning capabilities (likely part of the initial access or execution phase).
     - Using backdoors to gather file and directory information or monitor USB drives (which is a collection activity).
   - Before the collection activity, the attackers would need to discover the necessary information about the victim's environment to effectively use the backdoors. This discovery phase is crucial for identifying the files, directories, and USB drives to monitor.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the discovery phase occurred before the collection phase.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
