### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained through malicious PDFs or disguised executables.
   - The malware is then executed using an updated MiniDuke loader.
   - The next step in the sequence is that CosmicDuke targets credentials from various applications and Windows systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through malicious PDFs or disguised executables.
   - **Execution:** Using an updated MiniDuke loader.
   - **Targeting Credentials:** From various applications and Windows systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords. Given that CosmicDuke targets credentials from various applications and Windows systems, this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. While persistence is important, it typically follows after initial access and execution, and is not directly related to targeting credentials.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal and transfer data out of the network. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions. While privilege escalation can occur before credential access, the question specifically mentions targeting credentials, which is more aligned with the Credential Access tactic.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:** The attack starts with gaining access through malicious PDFs or disguised executables.
2. **Execution:** The malware is executed using an updated MiniDuke loader.
3. **Targeting Credentials:** The next logical step is to target credentials from various applications and Windows systems, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Credential Access
