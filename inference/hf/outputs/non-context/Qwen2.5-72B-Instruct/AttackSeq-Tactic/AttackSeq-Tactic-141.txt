### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses a custom version of Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - After obtaining credentials, the attacker collects system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
   - The final step mentioned is reading file contents for exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Obtaining credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.
   - **Intermediate Step:** Collecting system information (usernames, computer names, drive types).
   - **Final Step:** Reading file contents for exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system. While this is a valid tactic, it typically refers to the actual collection of data for exfiltration, which is the final step in the sequence described.
   - **B: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. This does not fit the intermediate step of collecting system information.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the system and network to aid in further actions. This fits the intermediate step of collecting system information such as usernames, computer names, and drive types.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves gaining entry to the system. This is not relevant to the intermediate step of collecting system information, as it is more about the initial entry point.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Initial Access** (not mentioned in the question but implied as a prerequisite).
     2. **Discovery** (collecting system information).
     3. **Collection** (reading file contents for exfiltration).

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
