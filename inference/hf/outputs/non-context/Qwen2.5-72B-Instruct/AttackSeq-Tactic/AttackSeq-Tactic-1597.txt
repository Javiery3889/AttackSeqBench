### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where persistence was established with C2 (Command and Control) beaconing.
   - The internal security team verified that a certain tactic did not take place after persistence and C2 beaconing.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence**: The attacker has established a mechanism to maintain access to the system.
   - **C2 Beaconing**: The attacker is maintaining communication with the compromised system.
   - **Verification by Internal Security Team**: The security team confirmed that a specific tactic did not occur.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the system. It is plausible that an attacker would collect data after establishing persistence and C2, but the question states that the security team verified this did not happen.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic is already mentioned as part of the sequence (C2 beaconing). Therefore, it cannot be the tactic that did not occur.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. It is often performed early in the attack lifecycle, but it is not necessarily the next step after persistence and C2 beaconing.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves moving from one system to another within the network. It is a logical next step after establishing persistence and C2, but the question states that the security team verified this did not happen.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the security team verified that a specific tactic did not occur, and considering the logical sequence of TTPs, the most plausible answer is the one that the security team would be most likely to verify as not having taken place.
   - **Lateral Movement** is a critical step that security teams often monitor and verify, as it can indicate the spread of the attack within the network.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
