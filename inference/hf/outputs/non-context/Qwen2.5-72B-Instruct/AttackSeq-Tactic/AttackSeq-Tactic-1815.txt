### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the execution of Empire PowerShell stagers and the use of reflective code loading to conceal malicious payload execution.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Empire PowerShell Stagers:** These are used to establish an initial foothold and communicate with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Reflective Code Loading:** This technique is used to load and execute code in memory without writing it to the disk, which helps in evading detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While Empire PowerShell stagers are used for C2, the question is asking about what happens after the stagers are executed and before reflective code loading.
   - **B: Persistence:**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While persistence is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not necessarily the most immediate step after executing stagers and before reflective code loading.
   - **C: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up C2 servers. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Reflective code loading is a common technique used for defense evasion, as it helps to hide the malicious payload from security tools.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after executing Empire PowerShell stagers, the attacker would use techniques to evade detection, such as reflective code loading, to conceal the malicious payload execution.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
