### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already established command and control using a self-developed backdoor named 'POWSSHNET' for RDP over SSH tunneling and employed reverse proxy tools like Ngrok and FRP.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the attackers manually selecting and compressing valuable intelligence into archives using tools like WinRAR or 7-zip.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that command and control has been established, so this is not the next step.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. The question does not mention any activities related to credential harvesting or access.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. The question does not mention any new execution of code or malware.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to an external location. The question describes the attackers manually selecting and compressing valuable intelligence, which is a preparatory step for exfiltration.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question indicates that the attackers have already established command and control.
   - The next logical step is to prepare the data for exfiltration by selecting and compressing valuable intelligence.
   - Compressing data is a common technique used to reduce the size of the data and make it easier to transfer, which aligns with the exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
