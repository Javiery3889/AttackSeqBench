### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with a threat actor delivering a macro-enabled XLS file via a phishing email.
   - The sequence ends with a VB macro within the XLS file executing a malicious Windows Installer object to download an MSI package.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor uses a phishing email to deliver the macro-enabled XLS file.
   - **Execution:** The VB macro within the XLS file executes a malicious Windows Installer object to download the MSI package.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain access to a system, such as phishing.
     - The delivery of the macro-enabled XLS file via phishing email is an example of Initial Access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves the execution of malicious code on a system.
     - The execution of the VB macro within the XLS file to download the MSI package is an example of Execution.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from a system.
     - There is no mention of credential harvesting or access in the given sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access.
     - There is no mention of moving through the network in the given sequence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the threat actor gaining initial access via a phishing email and then executing a malicious macro to download an MSI package.
   - The step that occurs between the delivery of the XLS file and the execution of the macro is the initial access to the system.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
