### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials and then redirect users to a YouTube clip posted by a persona.
   - The key elements are:
     - Fictitious login sites (phishing)
     - Collection of credentials
     - Redirection to a YouTube clip

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords. The use of fictitious login sites to collect credentials directly aligns with this tactic.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery might occur after credential access, it is not the immediate next step in the sequence described.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While defense evasion might be part of the overall attack, it is not the immediate next step after collecting credentials and redirecting users.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. While command and control might be a later step, it is not the immediate next step after collecting credentials and redirecting users.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that the fictitious login sites were used to collect credentials, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Credential Access**
