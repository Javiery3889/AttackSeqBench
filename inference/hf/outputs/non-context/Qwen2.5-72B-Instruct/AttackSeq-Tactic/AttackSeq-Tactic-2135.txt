### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor.
   - RoyalDNS is known to install persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Deployment:** APT15 deploys RoyalDNS.
   - **Persistence:** RoyalDNS installs persistently on the victim's network.
   - **Communication:** RoyalDNS uses DNS to communicate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is already part of the initial deployment and installation of RoyalDNS. The question asks what happens **after** the deployment.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack, such as gathering information or developing tools. It is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of what happens after deployment.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the victim's network. While it is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question does not provide specific evidence that this is the immediate next step.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's network. Given that RoyalDNS is a backdoor that can communicate using DNS, it is plausible that the next step would be to exfiltrate data using this communication channel.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After deploying and establishing persistence with RoyalDNS, the next logical step for an attacker would be to use the established communication channel to exfiltrate data from the victim's network.

### Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
