### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) and the execution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts to fetch malware from Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the malware was tested against antivirus detection to remain undetected.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Infection:** RIG EK successfully executed obfuscated PowerShell scripts.
   - **Malware Fetching:** The scripts fetched malware from C2 infrastructure.
   - **Antivirus Evasion:** The malware was tested against antivirus detection to remain undetected.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Testing malware against antivirus detection is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on a target system. The execution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts falls under this category.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. This is not directly related to the described sequence.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Fetching malware from C2 infrastructure is part of this tactic.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events starts with the execution of obfuscated PowerShell scripts (Execution).
   - The scripts then fetch malware from C2 infrastructure (Command and Control).
   - Before the malware is deployed, it is tested against antivirus detection to ensure it remains undetected (Defense Evasion).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the tactic of **Defense Evasion** occurred before the malware was tested against antivirus detection.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
