### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the Aurora operation.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6 to gain access.
     - Achieving persistence by installing itself as a service and modifying registry keys.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the tactic that occurs after the malware has gained access and is trying to maintain its presence on the system. However, the question states that persistence is achieved after the step we are trying to identify.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they have compromised. It often occurs after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the system, which is already described as using a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running the malware on the system. It typically follows initial access and precedes persistence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Initial Access**: Using a JavaScript-based exploit to gain access.
     2. **Execution**: Running the malware on the system.
     3. **Persistence**: Installing itself as a service and modifying registry keys.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
