### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events leading to the initial access of the Sayad malware.
   - The sequence starts with the development and staging of the malware's self-contained components.
   - The next step is the initial access through phishing emails, where users are tricked into downloading and executing the malicious executable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. In this case, it is the step where users are tricked into downloading and executing the malware. However, the question asks about the step before this.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources and infrastructure to support the attack. This includes developing and staging the malware's components, which aligns with the question's description of the development and staging of the self-contained malicious components.
   - **C: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It does not fit the context of the question, which is about the preparatory stages before initial access.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's control. It occurs after initial access and is not relevant to the development and staging of the malware components.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question asks about the step involving the development and staging of the malware's self-contained components, which is a preparatory action.
   - The most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this preparatory action is **Resource Development**.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Resource Development** tactic occurred before the **Initial Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Resource Development**
