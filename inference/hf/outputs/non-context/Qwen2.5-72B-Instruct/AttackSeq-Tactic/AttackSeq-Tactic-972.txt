### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already gained access to various credentials from targeted software and Windows systems.
   - The next step in the sequence involves collecting information via a keylogger and clipboard stealer.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Stage:** Gaining access to credentials.
   - **Final Stage:** Collecting information via a keylogger and clipboard stealer.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment better.
     - This could be a plausible step after gaining credentials but before deploying a keylogger and clipboard stealer, as the attacker might need to know more about the system to effectively use these tools.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time.
     - This is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining credentials and before collecting information, as the focus is on immediate data collection rather than long-term access.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the system.
     - This could be a step in deploying a keylogger and clipboard stealer, but it is more of a part of the final stage rather than a separate tactic between gaining credentials and collecting information.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials from the system.
     - This is the initial stage described in the question, not a step that occurs after gaining credentials.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible tactic that occurs between gaining access to credentials and collecting information via a keylogger and clipboard stealer is **Discovery**. The attacker would likely need to gather more information about the system to effectively deploy and use these tools.

### Final Answer: A: Discovery
