### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware is executed using benign executables that side-load malicious DLLs. These DLLs act as loaders for the PlugX implant.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to have occurred to ensure continued access to compromised systems using scheduled tasks and registry modifications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Execution:** Malware is executed using benign executables that side-load malicious DLLs.
   - **Loader for PlugX Implant:** The malicious DLLs act as loaders for the PlugX implant.
   - **Ensuring Continued Access:** The question specifically mentions the use of scheduled tasks and registry modifications to ensure continued access to the compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a crucial part of many attacks, it does not directly relate to ensuring continued access to a single compromised system.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. While it can be part of an attack, it does not directly relate to ensuring continued access to a compromised system.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a system. Scheduled tasks and registry modifications are common methods used for persistence.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running code. While it is part of the initial infection, it does not directly relate to ensuring continued access.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of scheduled tasks and registry modifications to ensure continued access, aligns with the **Persistence** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
