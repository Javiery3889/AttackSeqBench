### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a batch file is executed to install the main payload.
   - After the payload is installed, the malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing User Access Control (UAC).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Execution:** The batch file is executed to install the main payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware gains elevated privileges by bypassing UAC.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. It is not directly related to gaining elevated privileges.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is already part of the initial step (executing the batch file).
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is not directly related to gaining elevated privileges.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the system, which aligns with the described action of bypassing UAC to gain elevated privileges.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation**
