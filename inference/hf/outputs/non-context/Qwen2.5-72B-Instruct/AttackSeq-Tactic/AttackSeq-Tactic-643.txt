### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by GreyEnergy operators.
   - The sequence starts with gaining credential access using tools like Mimikatz.
   - The sequence ends with establishing internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes within the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This is often a step taken after gaining initial access to a system to perform more actions.
     - This could be a plausible step after gaining credential access, as the operators might need higher privileges to set up internal C&C proxies.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves establishing communication with the attacker's infrastructure. This is typically a later step in the attack sequence, often after gaining the necessary privileges and setting up the necessary infrastructure.
     - This is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining credential access.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is often done after gaining initial access and privileges to spread the attack.
     - This could be a plausible step after gaining credential access, but it is not necessarily the immediate next step before setting up C&C proxies.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access is the initial step of gaining access to credentials, which is already mentioned in the question.
     - This is not a valid choice as it is the starting point of the sequence.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Credential Access** (using tools like Mimikatz)
     2. **Privilege Escalation** (to gain higher-level permissions)
     3. **Command and Control** (establishing internal C&C proxies)
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after gaining credential access and before establishing internal C&C proxies is **Privilege Escalation**.

**Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation**
