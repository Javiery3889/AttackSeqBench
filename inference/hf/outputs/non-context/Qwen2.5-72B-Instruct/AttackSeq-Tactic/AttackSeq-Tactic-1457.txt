### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving a JavaScript dropper (`Scr.js`) that fingerprints the infected system and a backdoor (`KopiLuwak`) that communicates with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between the fingerprinting (system information discovery) and the communication with compromised websites (command and control).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** The JavaScript dropper `Scr.js` fingerprints the infected system by executing commands and saving the output to a temporary file. This is part of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - **Final Step:** The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests. This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While the JavaScript dropper is executing, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurs after the fingerprinting and before the communication. Therefore, this is not the correct choice.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system. The fingerprinting by `Scr.js` is already part of the Discovery tactic, so this is not the correct choice.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. After fingerprinting the system, the attacker might use techniques to evade defenses before establishing command and control. This is a plausible choice.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after fingerprinting and before command and control. Therefore, this is not the correct choice.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible tactic that fits between the fingerprinting and the communication with compromised websites is **Defense Evasion**. The attacker might use techniques to avoid detection before establishing command and control.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
