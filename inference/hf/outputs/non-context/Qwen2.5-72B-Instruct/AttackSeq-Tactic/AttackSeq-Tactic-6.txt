### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already performed discovery by querying the registry and identifying victim machines using specific registry keys.
   - The next step involves external communication on port 443 and references to internal IP addresses.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it.
     - External communication on port 443 (commonly used for HTTPS) is a typical method for C2.
     - References to internal IP addresses could indicate the attacker is setting up or using a C2 channel to manage the compromised system.
   - **B: Initial Access:**
     - This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain a foothold in the network.
     - The question already mentions that discovery has been performed, which typically follows initial access.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network.
     - The question states that discovery has already been performed.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker moving from one system to another within the network.
     - While lateral movement can involve communication, the specific mention of external communication on port 443 suggests a different tactic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after discovery is establishing a command and control channel.
   - The external communication on port 443 and references to internal IP addresses align with the C2 tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
