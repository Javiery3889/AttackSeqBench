### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Turla's RPC and PowerStallion backdoors.
   - The sequence involves monitoring antimalware logs and Windows process lists for information gathering.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these activities to ensure PowerShell scripts avoided detection through payload encryption and AMSI bypass.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Monitoring antimalware logs and Windows process lists:** This is part of the **Discovery** and **Collection** tactics.
   - **Avoiding detection through payload encryption and AMSI bypass:** This is part of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves sending data out of the network. It is not relevant to the initial steps of avoiding detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. Payload encryption and AMSI bypass are classic examples of defense evasion.
   - **Reconnaissance (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While important, it is not directly related to avoiding detection of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. It is not directly related to the initial steps of avoiding detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that ensures PowerShell scripts avoid detection through payload encryption and AMSI bypass.
   - **Defense Evasion** is the most appropriate tactic for this purpose.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
