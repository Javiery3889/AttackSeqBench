### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Scote malware.
   - The malware uses multiple techniques to evade detection, which aligns with the "Defense Evasion" tactic.
   - The malware then retrieves information from Pastebin postings or Google+ accounts to establish communications with its servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. While the malware does use techniques to evade detection, this is not the primary focus of the question, which is about establishing communication.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information they can use to plan future operations. Retrieving information from Pastebin or Google+ is not primarily about gathering information for planning but rather for communication.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Retrieving information from external sources to establish communication with servers is a clear example of C2.
   - **D: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a target network. The question does not mention data exfiltration, only communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the establishment of communication with the servers, which aligns with the "Command and Control" tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
