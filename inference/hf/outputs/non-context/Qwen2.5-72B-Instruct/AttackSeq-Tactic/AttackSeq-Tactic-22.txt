### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by UNC1945.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz.
     - Lateral movement using tools like ProxyChains and IMPACKET.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of collecting credentials and moving laterally.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - The Resource Development tactic involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques for stealing credentials, which aligns with the use of Mimikatz and the SLAPSTICK backdoor to collect credentials.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves techniques for gathering information about the target network and systems. This is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before moving laterally.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves collecting credentials (Credential Access) and then moving laterally (Lateral Movement).
   - Between these two steps, the attacker would likely need to discover the network topology, available systems, and potential targets to effectively move laterally.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between collecting credentials and moving laterally is Discovery.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
