### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the Grabit malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - The malware being downloaded from a malicious macro in a Microsoft Office Word attachment.
     - The malware modifying common registry entries for persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is downloaded from a malicious macro in a Word attachment. This is the initial point of entry into the system.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies common registry entries to ensure it remains active and can be reactivated after system reboots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the sequence. The malware gains initial access to the system through a malicious macro in a Word attachment.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence. The question does not indicate that the malware attempted to steal credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - This is the second step in the sequence. The malware modifies registry entries to ensure persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure to support the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events starts with the malware gaining initial access through a malicious macro, followed by the malware ensuring persistence by modifying registry entries.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the persistence step is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
