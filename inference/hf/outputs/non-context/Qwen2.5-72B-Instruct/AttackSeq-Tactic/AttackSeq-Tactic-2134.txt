### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15.
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - The RoyalDNS backdoor installed itself persistently on the victim's network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Final Action:** The RoyalDNS backdoor installed itself persistently on the victim's network.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - C2 involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system.
     - This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after gaining initial access and establishing persistence.
     - It is less likely to occur immediately after gaining credentials and before installing a backdoor.

   - **B: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time.
     - Installing a backdoor like RoyalDNS is a form of persistence.
     - This is a strong candidate because it fits the sequence where the attacker uses the gained credentials to install a persistent backdoor.

   - **C: Execution:**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the victim's system.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often used to gain initial access or to run tools like Mimikatz.
     - It is less likely to occur between gaining credentials and installing a backdoor.

   - **D: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before or during the attack.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often before gaining initial access.
     - It is less likely to occur between gaining credentials and installing a backdoor.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, the attacker would use those credentials to install a persistent backdoor.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between gaining credentials and installing the backdoor is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
