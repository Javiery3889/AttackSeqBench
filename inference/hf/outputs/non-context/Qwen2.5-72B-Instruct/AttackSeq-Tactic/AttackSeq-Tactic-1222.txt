### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers use credentials obtained via PoisonIvy to move laterally through the network.
   - The next step in the sequence involves preparing intellectual property archives on internal systems for staging.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Credentials obtained via PoisonIvy.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Using the obtained credentials to move through the network.
   - **Next Step:** Preparing intellectual property archives on internal systems for staging.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it might be part of the initial access or lateral movement, it does not fit the context of preparing archives for staging.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. Preparing intellectual property archives for staging is a form of data collection.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is part of the sequence, it does not fit the context of preparing archives for staging.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it might be used during the attack, it does not fit the context of preparing archives for staging.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attackers collecting data (intellectual property) and preparing it for exfiltration. This aligns with the **Collection** tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Collection
