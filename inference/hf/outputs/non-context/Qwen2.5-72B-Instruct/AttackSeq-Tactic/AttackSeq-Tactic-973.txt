### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where CosmicDuke, a known malware, searches for files on both hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers.
   - The key action here is the searching and identifying of specific files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While searching for files could be a precursor to lateral movement, the question specifically focuses on the act of searching and identifying files, not moving to other systems.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. Searching for specific files, especially those related to encryption ciphers, aligns well with the discovery phase, as the attacker is trying to find valuable information.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The question does not mention any communication with external servers or command centers.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. While searching for files is part of the collection process, the question specifically mentions the act of searching and identifying files, which is more aligned with the discovery phase.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Discovery**. The act of searching for specific files, especially those related to encryption ciphers, is a clear indicator of the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
