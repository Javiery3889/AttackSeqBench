### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN13:
     - Dumped LSASS process memory.
     - Used network sniffing tools to obtain passwords.
     - Escalated privileges using tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Dumping LSASS process memory** and **using network sniffing tools to obtain passwords** are techniques associated with **Credential Access**.
   - **Escalating privileges** using tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz is a technique associated with **Privilege Escalation**.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which has already been described in the question (dumping LSASS and network sniffing).
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. After obtaining credentials and escalating privileges, an attacker might set up persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before or during the initial stages of an attack, not after credential access and privilege escalation.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves techniques to gain information about the system and network. Discovery often occurs after initial access and before or during privilege escalation, but it is not the most likely next step after the described actions.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given that the attacker has already obtained credentials and escalated privileges, the next logical step would be to ensure they can maintain access to the system. This aligns with the **Persistence** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Persistence
