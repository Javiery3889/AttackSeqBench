### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
   - The malware then starts gathering information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the installation of the malware and the data gathering.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malware on the target system. This typically happens during the initial compromise or installation phase.
     - Since the malware is already installed, the execution phase has already occurred.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious tools.
     - This phase typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system.
     - After the malware is installed, it needs to communicate with the attacker's command and control server to receive instructions and exfiltrate data.
     - This is a plausible step before the malware starts gathering data.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the malware gathering information about the system and its environment.
     - This can occur after the malware is installed and before it starts gathering specific data like text messages and contact lists.
     - However, the question specifically mentions gathering data, which is a more targeted form of discovery.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after the malware is installed, it establishes a command and control channel to receive instructions from the attacker.
   - Once the C2 channel is established, the malware can then start gathering the specific data mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
