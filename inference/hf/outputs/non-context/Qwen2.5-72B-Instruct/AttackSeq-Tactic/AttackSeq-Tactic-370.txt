### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before London Blue sent a test email from an attack email account to verify successful delivery as part of their BEC (Business Email Compromise) campaign.
   - The key action here is sending a test email to verify successful delivery.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Sending a test email to verify successful delivery is a step that typically occurs after the attacker has set up the necessary infrastructure and before they initiate the actual attack.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after initial access has been gained and the attacker is controlling the compromised system.
     - This does not align with the action of sending a test email to verify delivery.

   - **B: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources and infrastructure for the attack, such as setting up email accounts, domains, and other tools.
     - Sending a test email to verify successful delivery is a logical next step after the resources have been developed to ensure that the infrastructure is working correctly.
     - This aligns well with the action described in the question.

   - **C: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry into the target network or system. This typically occurs after the resources have been developed and the attacker is ready to start the actual attack.
     - Sending a test email to verify delivery is a preparatory step that occurs before the initial access.

   - **D: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security systems. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has gained access and is trying to maintain persistence or avoid detection.
     - This does not align with the action of sending a test email to verify delivery.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker would first develop the necessary resources (Resource Development) and then send a test email to verify successful delivery.

### Final Answer: B: Resource Development
