### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence is as follows:
     1. **Discovery**: Probing files in specified directories.
     2. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two phases.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While this could be part of the initial infection or payload delivery, it is not typically an intermediate step between Discovery and Command and Control.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This is explicitly mentioned as the final step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. After discovering files in specified directories, the next logical step would be to collect the data before sending it to the C&C server.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C&C servers. This is typically done before the attack begins and not as an intermediate step.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Discovery**: Probing files in specified directories.
     2. **Collection**: Gathering the data from the discovered files.
     3. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between the Discovery and Command and Control phases is **Collection**.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
