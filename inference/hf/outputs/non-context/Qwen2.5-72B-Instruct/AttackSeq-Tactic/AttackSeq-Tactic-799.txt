### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious self-extracting RAR files to achieve initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine what tactic occurred before the attackers established command and control with infrastructure hosted on DynDNS services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious self-extracting RAR files to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers established command and control with infrastructure hosted on DynDNS services.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, where the attackers gain initial access to the target system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after initial access but before command and control.
   - **B: Execution:** After gaining initial access, the attackers need to execute the payload (the malicious self-extracting RAR file) to gain control over the system. This is a logical next step before establishing command and control.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This is the final step in the sequence, where the attackers establish communication with their command and control infrastructure.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** While defense evasion techniques can be used at various stages of the attack, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after initial access but before command and control. Defense evasion is not a necessary step between these two stages.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Initial Access** (spear phishing emails with malicious self-extracting RAR files)
     2. **Execution** (executing the payload)
     3. **Command and Control** (establishing communication with DynDNS infrastructure)

### Final Answer: B: Execution
