### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker uses JavaScript obfuscation to evade detection on compromised websites.
   - The next step involves the Pupy backdoor using the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Evasion:** JavaScript obfuscation is used to evade detection.
   - **Communication with Attacker-Controlled Infrastructure:** The Pupy backdoor uses the obfs3 protocol to communicate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker using various methods to communicate with and control the compromised system. The use of the obfs3 protocol to communicate with attacker-controlled infrastructure is a clear indicator of C2.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts. The question does not mention any credential harvesting or access attempts.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering data from the compromised system. The question does not mention any data collection activities.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to avoid detection or analysis. While JavaScript obfuscation is a form of defense evasion, the use of the obfs3 protocol is more specifically related to C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
