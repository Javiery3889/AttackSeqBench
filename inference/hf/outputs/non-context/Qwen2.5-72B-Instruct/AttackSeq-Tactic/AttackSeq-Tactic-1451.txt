### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the malware "SkinnyBoy."
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery Phase:** Enumerating directories (Desktop, Program Files, AppData).
     - **Data Exfiltration:** Sending base64 encoded data to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While enumeration can be part of reconnaissance, the question specifically mentions that the enumeration occurred during the discovery phase, which is a different tactic.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. Enumerating directories and collecting data from them aligns well with the collection phase.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. The question does not mention any actions that would ensure long-term access, such as creating new accounts or modifying system settings.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the C2 server. The question mentions sending data to the C2 server, which is part of the command and control phase, but this occurs after the data collection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The enumeration of directories (Desktop, Program Files, AppData) is a clear indication of the **Collection** phase, where the malware is gathering data of interest.
   - The subsequent action of sending the collected data to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request is part of the **Command and Control** phase, but this happens after the collection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Collection
