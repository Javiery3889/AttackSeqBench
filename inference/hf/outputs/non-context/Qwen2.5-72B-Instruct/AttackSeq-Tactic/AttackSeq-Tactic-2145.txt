### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first gather system profile information (OS version, architecture, running processes) to determine which machines to target next.
   - After this, the attackers add or remove domains in the database to manage infected environments.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gathering system profile information.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Adding or removing domains in the database.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle but does not directly involve gathering system information or managing infected environments.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, such as OS version, architecture, and running processes. This aligns well with the initial action described in the question.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the initial compromise. While it is related to information gathering, it typically occurs before the system is infected and does not involve managing infected environments.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it does not directly involve the initial information gathering described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial action of gathering system profile information (OS version, architecture, running processes) is a clear example of the **Discovery** tactic.
   - After discovering the system information, the attackers then manage the infected environments by adding or removing domains in the database. This management of infected environments is a part of the **Command and Control** tactic, but the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before this management.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the **Discovery** tactic occurred before the attackers added or removed domains in the database.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
