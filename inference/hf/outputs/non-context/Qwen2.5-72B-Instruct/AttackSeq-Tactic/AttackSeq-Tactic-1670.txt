### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Regin malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Extensive bidirectional command-and-control (C&C) operations.
     - Use of strong encryption and transport protocols like ICMP and HTTP.
     - Embedding payload information within cookies during HTTP-based C&C.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the next logical step after establishing C&C and embedding payload information within cookies.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic is already part of the described sequence. The question mentions that Regin is already using C&C operations, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques to steal and transfer data from the compromised system to the attacker's control. Given that the threat is embedding payload information within cookies during HTTP-based C&C, it is plausible that the next step is to exfiltrate data using these techniques.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gain initial foothold on the target system. Since the question describes ongoing C&C operations, initial access has already been achieved.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible next step in the attack sequence, after establishing C&C and embedding payload information within cookies, is to exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
