### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence by the Lazarus group.
   - The sequence includes the use of backdoor malware packed with Themida to execute remote commands.
   - The sequence also includes the deployment of Hermes ransomware to disrupt operations.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Backdoor malware packed with Themida to execute remote commands.
   - **Final Step:** Deployment of Hermes ransomware to disrupt operations.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves communicating with systems controlled by the adversary. Since the backdoor malware is already used to execute remote commands, this tactic is likely already in place.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is a crucial part of the attack, it is typically used throughout the attack, not specifically between the backdoor and ransomware deployment.
   - **C: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the actual disruption or destruction of the target's operations. The deployment of Hermes ransomware is a clear example of the Impact tactic.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system. While persistence is important, it is typically established early in the attack to ensure long-term access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The backdoor malware packed with Themida is used to execute remote commands, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The deployment of Hermes ransomware is part of the Impact tactic.
   - Between these two steps, the most likely tactic is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the attackers would need to ensure that their activities are not detected while they prepare for the final impact phase.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
