### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker decrypts obfuscated registry content using an AES256 Decryptor and then deploys the njRAT remote access tool.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Decryption of Obfuscated Registry Content:** This action is likely part of the process of gaining access to or maintaining control over the system. It could be part of the initial stages of an attack where the attacker is trying to avoid detection.
   - **Deployment of njRAT Remote Access Tool:** This is a clear indication of establishing a persistent and remote connection to the compromised system, allowing the attacker to control the system from a distance.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While decrypting obfuscated content could be part of defense evasion, it is not the primary focus after deploying a remote access tool.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Deploying a remote access tool like njRAT is a clear indication of establishing command and control.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. While the initial access might have been a prerequisite for the described actions, the question is asking about what happens after the deployment of njRAT.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after decrypting obfuscated registry content and deploying njRAT is the establishment of command and control.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
