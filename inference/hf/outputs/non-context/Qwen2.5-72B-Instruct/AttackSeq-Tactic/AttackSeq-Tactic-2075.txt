### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackSoul malware.
   - The sequence includes evasion techniques (dynamic string construction and deobfuscation) followed by the collection of browser data and credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Evasion:** BlackSoul uses dynamic string construction and deobfuscation to evade defenses.
   - **Collection:** BlackSoul collects browser data and credentials from Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial steps (dynamic string construction and deobfuscation).
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not directly related to the collection of browser data and credentials.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While it can be a precursor to an attack, it is not typically the immediate step before collecting browser data and credentials.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns well with the collection of browser data and credentials from Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves evasion techniques followed by the collection of browser data and credentials.
   - The most logical step before collecting browser data and credentials is to gain access to the credentials, which falls under the **Credential Access** tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
