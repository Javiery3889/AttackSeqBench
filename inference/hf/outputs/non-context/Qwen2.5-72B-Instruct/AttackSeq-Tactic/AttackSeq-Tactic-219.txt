### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the EyePyramid malware.
   - The malware has already established communication with C&C servers.
   - The next step is to exfiltrate stolen data using email addresses.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** The malware establishes communication with C&C servers.
   - **Next Step:** The malware exfiltrates stolen data using email addresses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Since the malware has already established communication with C&C servers, this step has already occurred.
   - **B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. This step would typically occur before establishing C&C communication.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This step would typically occur before the malware is even deployed.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from the victim's system to the attacker's system. Given that the malware is using email addresses to send stolen data, this is the most logical next step after establishing C&C communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the malware exfiltrates stolen data after establishing communication with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
