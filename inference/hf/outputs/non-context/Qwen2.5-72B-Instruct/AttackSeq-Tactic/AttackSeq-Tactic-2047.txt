### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Iron Tiger's rshell backdoor.
   - The backdoor collected OS information and transmitted it to the C&C server.
   - The backdoor continued to receive and execute commands from the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection**: The backdoor collected OS information.
   - **Command and Control (C2)**: The backdoor transmitted the collected information to the C&C server and received further commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While defense evasion might be part of the overall attack, it is not the next logical step after the backdoor has already collected and transmitted data.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. While lateral movement could occur after initial access, the question does not provide information suggesting that the backdoor has moved to other systems.
   - **C: Discovery**: This tactic involves techniques to gain information about the system and network. The backdoor has already collected OS information, which is a form of discovery, but the question states that it is continuing to receive and execute commands, suggesting ongoing C2 activity.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. The backdoor is already transmitting data to the C&C server and receiving commands, which aligns with the C2 tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the backdoor is continuing to engage in Command and Control activities.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
