### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Stuxnet, including rootkit functionality for hiding its presence and using stolen digital certificates to sign its kernel-mode drivers for evasion.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred while exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Rootkit Functionality:** This is used for hiding the presence of the malware, which falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Stolen Digital Certificates:** These are used to sign kernel-mode drivers, which also falls under **Defense Evasion**.
   - **Exploiting MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler Vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities are used to spread the malware across networked systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. While the rootkit and stolen certificates are part of this tactic, the question specifically asks about the exploitation of vulnerabilities to spread across networked systems.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on a target system. While execution is a crucial part of the attack, the question is more focused on the spreading mechanism.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. Exploiting vulnerabilities like MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler to spread across networked systems is a clear example of lateral movement.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. While command and control is important, it is not the focus of the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The rootkit and stolen certificates are used for **Defense Evasion**.
   - The exploitation of MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities is used to spread the malware across networked systems, which is a clear example of **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
