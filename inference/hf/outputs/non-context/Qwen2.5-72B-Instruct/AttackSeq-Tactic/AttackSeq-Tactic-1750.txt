### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider.
   - The file is then used to execute the EVILNUM malware, which includes a headless Javascript agent disguised as decoy business files.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The victim is enticed to follow a link.
   - The link leads to a file hosted on a cloud provider.
   - The file is downloaded and executed, leading to the deployment of the EVILNUM malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target. While this might occur before the initial access, it is not the most likely tactic for the described sequence.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on the victim's system. This is a step that occurs after the initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the attacker gaining entry into the victim's system. Enticing the victim to follow a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider is a common method of initial access.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves the attacker maintaining long-term access to the victim's system. This is a step that occurs after the initial access and execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with the victim being enticed to follow a link.
   - The link leads to a file hosted on a cloud provider, which is a common method for initial access.
   - Once the file is downloaded and executed, the EVILNUM malware is deployed.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of the malware is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
