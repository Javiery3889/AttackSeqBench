### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has already discovered files of interest through enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
   - The next step in the sequence is the exfiltration of these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery:** The attacker has already performed discovery by enumerating data directories and gathering system information.
   - **Exfiltration:** The files are being exfiltrated using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This is the initial step where the attacker discovers files of interest. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before exfiltration, which is already after the discovery phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems. This is not directly related to the exfiltration of files.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is not relevant to the exfiltration of files.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data of interest before exfiltration. This fits well with the sequence described, as the attacker has already discovered the files and is now preparing to exfiltrate them.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker performed collection after discovery and before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
