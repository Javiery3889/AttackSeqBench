### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where infected devices with backdoors were used to steal one-time passwords (OTPs) and create WhatsApp and Gmail accounts.
   - The key actions are: 
     - Infection with backdoors.
     - Stealing OTPs.
     - Creating accounts on WhatsApp and Gmail.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs before or concurrently with the actions described in the question.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the compromised system. While this can be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the actions of stealing OTPs and creating accounts.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the compromised system and network. While this can be a step in the attack, it is not directly related to the actions of stealing OTPs and creating accounts.
   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker attempting to steal credentials, which aligns with the action of stealing OTPs. Creating accounts on WhatsApp and Gmail using stolen OTPs is a direct result of gaining access to these credentials.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **D: Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
