### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Derusbi (a malware) gathers host information and transfers it back via network beacons.
   - It then binds to a random source port and communicates with a preconfigured destination port 443.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Gathering Host Information:** This is part of the **Discovery** tactic, where the malware collects information about the host.
   - **Transferring Information via Network Beacons:** This is part of the **Command and Control** (C2) tactic, where the malware communicates with a command and control server to exfiltrate data.
   - **Binding to a Random Source Port and Communicating with Port 443:** This is also part of the **Command and Control** tactic, as it involves establishing and maintaining communication with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The binding to a random source port and communicating with a preconfigured destination port 443 aligns well with this tactic.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves the methods used to gather data from the target network. While the initial gathering of host information is part of this, the communication with the C2 server is not.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. The described actions do not involve privilege escalation.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While the initial gathering of host information is part of this, the communication with the C2 server is not.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
