### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers executed a malicious DLL using legitimate program executables to launch a backdoor binary blob.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     - Execution of a malicious DLL.
     - Use of legitimate program executables to launch the DLL.
     - Launching a backdoor binary blob.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that attackers use to gain an initial foothold in a network. This typically happens before the execution of a malicious DLL.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the execution of the DLL is already part of the attack.

   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that attackers use to avoid detection and analysis. Using legitimate program executables to launch a malicious DLL is a common defense evasion technique.
     - However, the question asks what happens **after** the execution of the DLL, not during or before it.

   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on a target system. The execution of the malicious DLL and the launching of the backdoor binary blob are part of the Execution phase.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the execution is already part of the attack.

   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that allow attackers to move through a network to expand their access. After launching a backdoor binary blob, attackers often use this backdoor to move laterally within the network.
     - This fits the sequence described, as the backdoor binary blob would likely be used to gain further access and move through the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Lateral Movement occurred after the execution of the malicious DLL and the launching of the backdoor binary blob.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
