### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a malicious batch file executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to download and extract the main malware library DLL and other components.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur after these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial actions include:
     - Execution of a malicious batch file.
     - Use of PowerShell to download and extract malware components.
   - These actions fall under the **Execution** and **Command and Scripting Interpreter** tactics.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the system, which typically happens after the malware is already running and has established a foothold. This is less likely to be the immediate next step after downloading and extracting components.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot or other disruptions. This is a logical next step after the initial execution and downloading of components, as the attacker would want to maintain access.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain higher privileges or access to other systems. This is also a logical next step, but it might not be the immediate next action after downloading and extracting components.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malware components that have been downloaded and extracted. Since the question already states that the components have been downloaded and extracted, the next step would not be another execution but rather what the malware does next.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence of actions described, the most logical next step would be to ensure that the malware remains on the system, which aligns with the **Persistence** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Persistence
