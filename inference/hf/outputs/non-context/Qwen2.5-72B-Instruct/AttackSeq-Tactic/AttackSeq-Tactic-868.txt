### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor 'Energetic Bear'.
   - The specific action mentioned is the injection of SMB credential-harvesting malware into a website to target specific entities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial action is the strategic web compromise, which involves injecting malware into a website.
   - The goal of this action is to target specific entities, likely to gain access to their systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they have compromised. It typically occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. It typically occurs before the initial compromise.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the adversary gaining entry into the target network. Injecting malware into a website to harvest credentials is a method of gaining initial access.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. It typically occurs after gaining initial access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The injection of SMB credential-harvesting malware into the website is a method of gaining initial access to the target network.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the strategic web compromise is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
