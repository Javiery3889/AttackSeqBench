### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers first exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Windows to gain initial access to a system.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers use CVE-2021-31956 and CVE-2021-31955 to escape the sandbox and inject malware into a system process.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Windows.
   - **Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:** Using CVE-2021-31956 and CVE-2021-31955 to escape the sandbox and inject malware into a system process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is typically done after gaining access and establishing a foothold. It is not a likely candidate for the step immediately following initial access and before privilege escalation.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker's infrastructure. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not the immediate next step after initial access and before privilege escalation.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of the system, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not a likely candidate for the step immediately following initial access and before privilege escalation.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. Escaping the sandbox and injecting malware into a system process are clear indicators of privilege escalation.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence described in the question involves gaining initial access, followed by using specific vulnerabilities to escape the sandbox and inject malware. This clearly aligns with the Privilege Escalation tactic, as the attackers are elevating their privileges to perform these actions.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Privilege Escalation
