### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Grandoreiro malware.
   - The malware gains higher-level permissions by registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to achieve elevated privileges.
   - The next step in the sequence is communication with a C2 server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Gain higher-level permissions (e.g., registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files).
   - **Next Step:** Communicate with the C2 server using the RealThinClient SDK.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. This is typically done before gaining elevated privileges to understand the environment better.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to gain access to systems. This is often a prerequisite for gaining elevated privileges.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location. This is typically a later stage in the attack, after the attacker has already gained access and performed other actions.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data of interest before exfiltration. This is also a later stage in the attack, typically after the attacker has gained access and performed other actions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The question states that the malware gains higher-level permissions before communicating with the C2 server. This implies that the malware has already gained access to the system and is now preparing to receive commands.
   - The most logical step before communicating with the C2 server would be to ensure that the malware has the necessary credentials to maintain access and perform further actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the malware first gains elevated privileges (which is a form of Credential Access) and then communicates with the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Credential Access
