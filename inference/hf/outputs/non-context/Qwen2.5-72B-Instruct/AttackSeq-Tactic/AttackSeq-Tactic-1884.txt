### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Shellbot gathers information about the infected host's processor details and monitoring tools.
   - The next step involves maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** Gathering information about the infected host (Discovery).
   - **Next TTP:** Maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands and execute malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While it is a common next step after initial access, the question specifically mentions maintaining communication through an IRC channel, which is more aligned with command and control.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is a crucial part of the attack, the question is about maintaining communication, which is more specific to command and control.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the host, which has already been mentioned in the question. Therefore, it is not the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the infected host to control it and execute further malicious activities. Maintaining communication through an IRC channel to send commands aligns perfectly with this tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
