### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker (Suckfly) has already scanned the corporate internal network for open ports and hosts.
   - The next step involves using hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the internal network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Scanning the network for open ports and hosts.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Using hacktools to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure or acquiring tools. This does not align with the described sequence of actions.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. While scanning for open ports and hosts is part of discovery, the question specifically mentions the use of hacktools to escalate privileges and move laterally, which goes beyond the discovery phase.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target network and transferring it to an attacker-controlled location. The question does not mention any data exfiltration activities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to expand the attacker's control and access. Using hacktools to escalate privileges and traverse within the network is a clear indication of lateral movement.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves scanning the network, followed by using hacktools to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.
- The most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that aligns with these actions is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
