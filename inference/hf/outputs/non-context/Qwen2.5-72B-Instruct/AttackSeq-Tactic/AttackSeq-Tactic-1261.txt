### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Fox Kitten Campaign moved laterally using tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE'.
   - The key phrase here is "moved laterally," which refers to the **Lateral Movement** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**:
     - Discovery involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network to identify potential targets for lateral movement. This is often a prerequisite for lateral movement, as the adversary needs to know what systems are available and how they can be accessed.
   - **B: Resource Development**:
     - Resource Development involves the adversary establishing the infrastructure and resources needed to support the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to lateral movement.
   - **C: Command and Control**:
     - Command and Control involves the adversary maintaining control over the compromised systems. While this is necessary for executing lateral movement, it is not a direct prerequisite for the lateral movement itself.
   - **D: Credential Access**:
     - Credential Access involves the adversary obtaining the necessary credentials to access other systems. This is often a critical step before lateral movement, as the adversary needs valid credentials to move to other systems.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery** is a logical step before lateral movement, as the adversary needs to know what systems are available and how they can be accessed.
   - **Credential Access** is also a critical step, as the adversary needs valid credentials to move to other systems.
   - Between the two, **Credential Access** is more directly related to the ability to perform lateral movement, as it provides the necessary credentials that are often required for tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' to function effectively.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
