### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an APT group (APT12) gains initial access through spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that exploit CVE-2012-0158.
   - After gaining initial access, the group establishes connections to C2 servers using backdoors such as HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - **Establishing C2 Connections:** Using backdoors like HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's network. While it is a crucial step in many attack sequences, it typically occurs after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly after setting up C2 communications.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Given that the question mentions the use of backdoors to establish connections to C2 servers, this is a strong candidate for the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is often used early in an attack, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up C2 servers. This typically occurs before the initial access phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails with malicious documents.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to establish command and control (C2) to maintain and manage the compromised system.
   - Establishing C2 connections using backdoors like HIGHTIDE, THREEBYTE, and WATERSPOUT is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.
   - Collection, Defense Evasion, and Resource Development are important but do not fit as the immediate next step in this sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
