### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware has already scanned for files with specific extensions and staged the data on the victim's system.
   - The next step in the sequence is to send the prepared data to the C&C (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support the attack, such as setting up C&C servers. It typically occurs before the actual attack and is not related to the exfiltration of data.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the process of stealing data and sending it to an external location, such as a C&C server. This aligns with the described sequence where the data is being sent out.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The question already states that the data has been staged, so this step has already occurred.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with the C&C server to receive commands and send data. While this is part of the overall attack, the specific step of sending the prepared data to the C&C server is more accurately described by the Exfiltration tactic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Exfiltration**.

**Final Answer: B: Exfiltration**
