### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained by distributing malware disguised as legitimate software updates and seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malicious files.
   - The next step in the sequence is maintaining persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infectors.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the persistence was established.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malicious code on the victim's system. While this is a crucial step, it typically follows the initial access and is part of the process of establishing persistence.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While reconnaissance can occur before initial access, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion can occur at various stages, it is often used to maintain persistence and avoid detection after initial access.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the victim's system. The question explicitly states that initial access was gained by distributing malware and seeding P2P sites, so this is the first step in the sequence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with gaining initial access, followed by maintaining persistence.
   - The tactic that most likely occurred before maintaining persistence is the initial access itself.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
