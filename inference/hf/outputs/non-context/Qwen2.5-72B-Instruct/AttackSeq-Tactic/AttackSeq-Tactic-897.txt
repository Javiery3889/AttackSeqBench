### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an infected machine collects system information and sends it to a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - After this, POWERSHOWER enters a communications loop, receiving instructions via a GET request status code.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection**: The infected machine collects system information.
   - **Exfiltration**: The collected information is sent to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control**: POWERSHOWER enters a communications loop, receiving instructions via a GET request status code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the adversary's use of remote systems to control the compromised system. The description of POWERSHOWER entering a communications loop and receiving instructions via a GET request status code aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **B: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. This does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to the system. The question does not mention how the initial access was gained, only what happens after the system is already compromised.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to understand the environment they have compromised. While collecting system information is part of Discovery, the question specifically mentions that the information has already been collected and sent to the C2 server, and the next step is receiving instructions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Command and Control tactic occurred after the collection and exfiltration of system information.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
