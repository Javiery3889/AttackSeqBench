### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where TG-3279 used a port scanning tool named 's' and an RDP brute force tool 'rdp_crk' to scan and exploit targets.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Port Scanning:** This is a technique used to discover open ports on a target system.
   - **RDP Brute Force:** This is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to a system by repeatedly attempting to guess the correct RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) credentials.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This could include identifying open ports, network topology, and potential vulnerabilities.
     - Port scanning is a common reconnaissance technique used to identify open ports and services on a target.
   - **B: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves the attacker exploring the network and systems to understand the environment better. This typically occurs after initial access has been gained.
     - While discovery can involve scanning, it is more about exploring the internal network and systems, not the initial scanning of the target.
   - **C: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as creating malware, setting up command and control infrastructure, and gathering tools.
     - This tactic is more about the preparation phase and not the initial scanning of the target.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security systems.
     - This tactic is typically used after gaining initial access and is not related to the initial scanning and exploitation phase.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first performed **Reconnaissance** to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities before using the RDP brute force tool to exploit the target.

### Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
