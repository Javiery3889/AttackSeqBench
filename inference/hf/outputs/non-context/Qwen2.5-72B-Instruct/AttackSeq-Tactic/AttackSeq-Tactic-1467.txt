### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems.
     2. An unknown tactic (which we need to determine).
     3. Use of malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is typically a final step in an attack sequence, not something that occurs between reconnaissance and the use of malicious updates.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - The C2 tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. This is a necessary step after gaining initial access and conducting reconnaissance, but it is not typically the next step after internal reconnaissance in the context of the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information from the network and systems. However, the question already states that internal reconnaissance (a form of discovery) has been conducted. Therefore, this is not a plausible next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - The Lateral Movement tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. This is a logical next step after conducting internal reconnaissance, as the adversaries would use the information gathered to move to other parts of the network, potentially to the control center and substations.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after internal reconnaissance and before using malicious updates to sever connections is Lateral Movement.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
