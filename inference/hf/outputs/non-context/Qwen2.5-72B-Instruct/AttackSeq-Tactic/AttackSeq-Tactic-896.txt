### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has used anti-forensic techniques to evade detection and established persistence using a run key in the registry.
   - The next step in the sequence is that POWERSHOWER began sending system information to the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Anti-forensic techniques**: This falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Establishing persistence using a run key in the registry**: This falls under the **Persistence** tactic.
   - **Sending system information to the C2 server**: This action involves gathering and exfiltrating information, which is part of the **Command and Control** and **Exfiltration** tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a network. This typically happens before any anti-forensic techniques or persistence mechanisms are established.
     - This does not fit the sequence described in the question, as the anti-forensic techniques and persistence are already in place.

   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. This is already part of the sequence described (anti-forensic techniques).
     - This does not fit as the next step after persistence and before sending system information to the C2 server.

   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after the adversary has achieved their primary objectives.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the next step is sending system information to the C2 server, which is more aligned with reconnaissance and exfiltration.

   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This is a logical step after gaining persistence and before sending system information to the C2 server.
     - The adversary would need to discover system information to know what to send to the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible next step after establishing persistence and before sending system information to the C2 server is the **Discovery** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
