### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where threat actors executed the BlackEnergy 3 malware on targeted employee workstations.
   - The execution was facilitated by the employees enabling macros in weaponized MS Office documents.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Enabling macros in weaponized MS Office documents.
     - Execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It typically occurs after initial access and execution, not before.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial entry into a system. Enabling macros in weaponized documents is a common method for initial access, as it allows the malware to be delivered and executed.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While enabling macros can be a form of defense evasion, it is more accurately described as a method of initial access.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running the malware. The question explicitly states that the execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware occurred after the macros were enabled.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The enabling of macros in weaponized MS Office documents is a method used to gain initial access to the system. Once the macros are enabled, the malware can be executed.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the initial access occurred before the execution of the malware.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
