### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the group first conducted reconnaissance through phishing domains.
   - After reconnaissance, the group established alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials such as usernames and passwords. This is often a step taken after initial reconnaissance to gain the necessary credentials to access the target system.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is the initial stage where the adversary gathers information about the target. The question already states that reconnaissance has been conducted, so this is not a plausible answer for the next step.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into the network. This typically follows reconnaissance and is a logical next step before establishing persistence.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to the victim system. The question states that this is the final step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer for the step that occurs between reconnaissance and persistence.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most logical step between reconnaissance and persistence is **Initial Access**. After gathering information through reconnaissance, the next step is to gain initial access to the target system, which can then be followed by establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
