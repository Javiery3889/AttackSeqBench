### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the SideCopy APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Developing phishing portals mimicking the Government of India's webmail.
     - Deploying a variety of RATs and post-infection plugins.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network.
     - This tactic is typically used after gaining initial access to a system to expand the adversary's control.
     - It does not fit well between developing phishing portals and deploying RATs, as it is more of a post-access activity.

   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code on a victim's system.
     - This tactic is often used after gaining initial access to execute payloads like RATs.
     - It fits well after gaining initial access but is not the most likely step immediately after developing phishing portals.

   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - This tactic is typically used after gaining initial access and executing initial payloads to ensure long-term control.
     - It does not fit well between developing phishing portals and deploying RATs, as it is more of a post-execution activity.

   - **D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network.
     - This tactic is the first step in the attack chain, where the adversary gains entry into the target environment.
     - Developing phishing portals is a common method for Initial Access, as it is used to trick users into providing credentials or clicking on malicious links.
     - After gaining initial access, the adversary can then deploy RATs and other post-infection plugins.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with the development of phishing portals, which is a method for Initial Access.
   - After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to deploy RATs and post-infection plugins.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two actions is Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
