### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the deployment of the Infy malware, maintaining its presence, and then registering domains for data exfiltration.
   - The key points are:
     - Deployment of Infy malware.
     - Maintaining presence without altering encoding keys.
     - Registering domains for data exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the techniques used to gain a foothold in the target network. This is typically the first step in an attack sequence.
     - However, the question implies that the malware has already been deployed and is maintaining its presence, which suggests that Initial Access has already occurred.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network.
     - The question mentions registering domains for data exfiltration, which is a step that typically occurs after the data has been collected and is ready to be exfiltrated.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques used to gain information about the target network, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts.
     - Discovery is often a necessary step before data exfiltration, as attackers need to know what data is available and how to access it.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves maintaining communication with the compromised system to control it and execute further actions.
     - Maintaining the presence of the malware without altering encoding keys suggests that the attackers are already in control of the system and are using C2 to manage the malware.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question implies that the malware has already been deployed and is maintaining its presence, which suggests that Initial Access and Command and Control have already occurred.
   - The next logical step before data exfiltration would be to discover what data is available and how to access it.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Discovery occurred before the attackers registered domains for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
