### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells, followed by running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604:** This is an initial access or exploitation tactic.
   - **Installation of webshells:** This is typically part of the **Execution** or **Persistence** tactics.
   - **Running commands for system and user discovery using the AntSword webshell:** This is part of the **Discovery** tactic.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic is typically the first step in an attack, where the adversary gains entry into the system. It is not likely to occur after the installation of webshells.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain higher privileges or access to other systems. While it can occur after initial access, it is not the most likely step before running discovery commands.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network. It is a logical next step after gaining a foothold and installing webshells, as the adversary would want to understand the environment before taking further actions.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While it is part of the initial steps, it is not the most likely step to occur between installing webshells and running discovery commands.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversary exploited CVE-2019-0604 to gain initial access, installed webshells, and then used the webshells to run commands for system and user discovery.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between installing webshells and running discovery commands is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
