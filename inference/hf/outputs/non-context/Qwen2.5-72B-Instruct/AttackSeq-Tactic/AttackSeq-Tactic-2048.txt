### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before XAgent malware began running in the background immediately upon installation on iOS 7 devices.
   - The key phrase is "immediately upon installation," which suggests that the malware is already present and active on the device.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of events described is:
     1. The malware is installed on the device.
     2. The malware begins running in the background immediately after installation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. It is unlikely to occur before the malware is installed and running.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves the process of running the malware. Since the question states that the malware is already running in the background, this tactic is part of the sequence but not necessarily the one that occurred before the installation.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial entry into the system. This is a logical step that must occur before the malware can be installed and run.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves the process of stealing credentials. While this can occur before or after the malware is installed, it is not a necessary prerequisite for the malware to begin running immediately upon installation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware must first gain access to the device (Initial Access) before it can be installed.
   - Once the malware is installed, it can then begin running in the background.
   - The other tactics (Exfiltration, Execution, and Credential Access) are either part of the post-installation activities or not necessarily required for the malware to start running immediately.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
