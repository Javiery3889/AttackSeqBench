### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a specific action taken by the Shamoon malware: overwriting the disk's boot records (MBR and VBR), which prevents access to the affected file systems.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this action.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The action described (overwriting the MBR and VBR) is a destructive action that renders the system inoperable.
   - This action is typically associated with the **Impact** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which involves actions that directly affect the availability or integrity of systems and data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with systems under the attacker's control. It is typically used to maintain control over compromised systems, but it does not fit the context of a destructive action that has already occurred.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. While this might be part of the initial stages of an attack, it does not fit the context of a post-destruction action.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that affect the availability or integrity of systems and data. Overwriting the MBR and VBR to prevent access to the file system is a clear example of an impact action.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information from a system or network. It is typically used in the early stages of an attack to understand the environment, but it does not fit the context of a post-destruction action.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that the **Impact** tactic occurred after the MBR and VBR were overwritten.

**Final Answer: C: Impact**
