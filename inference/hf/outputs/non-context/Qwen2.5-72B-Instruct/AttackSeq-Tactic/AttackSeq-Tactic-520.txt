### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers sent malicious email attachments to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel, Word, and Java.
   - The goal of these actions is to gain a foothold in the target systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial action is sending malicious email attachments.
   - These attachments exploit vulnerabilities in specific applications (Excel, Word, Java).
   - The purpose is to gain initial access to the target systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.
     - This is not the most immediate next step after sending malicious email attachments.

   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves increasing the level of access from a lower-privileged account to a higher-privileged one.
     - This is a common next step after gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step after sending the malicious email.

   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic used to gain the initial foothold in the target systems.
     - The question already describes the method used to gain initial access (malicious email attachments exploiting vulnerabilities).
     - This is not the next step but rather the current step in the attack sequence.

   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious code or payload that was delivered through the initial access method.
     - After the malicious email attachments are opened and the vulnerabilities are exploited, the next logical step is the execution of the malicious code to gain control of the system.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers would execute the malicious code after gaining initial access through the email attachments.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
