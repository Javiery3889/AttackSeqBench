### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes the use of tools like Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation.
   - The next step in the sequence is internal reconnaissance to map the network using Windows and open-source pentesting tools.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Stage:** Use of Quasar RAT and mimikatz for reconnaissance and propagation.
   - **Next Stage:** Internal reconnaissance to map the network.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords.
     - Quasar RAT and mimikatz are often used to steal credentials, which aligns with the initial stage of the attack.
     - However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the initial use of these tools and before internal reconnaissance.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - This tactic is typically used after gaining initial access and securing credentials, but it is not necessarily a prerequisite for internal reconnaissance.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access and control.
     - After gaining initial access and securing credentials, the next logical step is to move laterally within the network to gain a better understanding of the environment.
     - This aligns well with the internal reconnaissance stage described in the question.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise.
     - While this is an important tactic, it is not the primary focus between gaining initial access and conducting internal reconnaissance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access and securing credentials, the next step is to move laterally within the network to conduct internal reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic that fits this sequence is Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
