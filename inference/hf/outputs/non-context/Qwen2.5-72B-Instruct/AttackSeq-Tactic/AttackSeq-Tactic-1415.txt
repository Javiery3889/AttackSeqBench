### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Smooth Operator stages data for exfiltration by collecting operating system details and domain values from `config.json`.
   - The next step involves using multiple randomly chosen HTTPS C2 servers with a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Collection of operating system details and domain values from `config.json` (likely part of the Discovery or Collection tactics).
   - **Next Step:** Use of multiple randomly chosen HTTPS C2 servers with a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information from the target system, which has already been described in the initial step (collecting OS details and domain values). Therefore, this is not the next step.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the actual transfer of data out of the network. While this is a plausible next step, the question specifically mentions the use of C2 servers, which is more aligned with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. The question does not mention any actions that would ensure long-term access, so this is not the most likely next step.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The use of multiple randomly chosen HTTPS C2 servers with a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation is a clear indication of C2 activities.

### Final Reasoning
- The initial step of collecting OS details and domain values is part of the Discovery or Collection tactics.
- The next step, involving the use of multiple randomly chosen HTTPS C2 servers with a custom encoding algorithm for obfuscation, is most aligned with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
