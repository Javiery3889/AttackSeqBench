### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Machete group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Scanning for key and certificate file extensions.
     - Exfiltrating stored browser credentials.
     - Collecting data such as clipboard contents, local files, and captured screenshots.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the target system and network. This could include identifying key files, network configurations, and other relevant data.
     - Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating stored browser credentials are actions that could be part of the Discovery phase, but they are more specific to the Collection phase.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is typically a step that occurs after initial access and before or during the execution of other tactics.
     - The actions described in the question do not align with C2 activities.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from the target system. This includes exfiltrating stored browser credentials, collecting clipboard contents, local files, and capturing screenshots.
     - The actions described in the question (scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating stored browser credentials, and collecting data) are all part of the Collection phase.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - The Resource Development tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing malware, creating infrastructure, and gathering tools.
     - The actions described in the question are not related to resource development.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Collection tactic occurred before the data collection activities.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
