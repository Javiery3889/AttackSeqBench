### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a threat actor uses an RTF document to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.
   - The RTF document drops a file named 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder.
   - The file requires a relaunch of Word for full execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor gains initial access to the system by using an RTF document to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word.
   - **Execution:** The dropped file 'intel.wll' is placed in the Word startup folder, and it requires a relaunch of Word to execute.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. The question does not mention any actions related to privilege escalation.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. The question does not mention any resource development activities.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial entry into a system. While the RTF document is used for initial access, the question is asking about what happens after the initial access.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. The question states that the 'intel.wll' file is dropped and requires a relaunch of Word to execute, which aligns with the Execution tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Execution
