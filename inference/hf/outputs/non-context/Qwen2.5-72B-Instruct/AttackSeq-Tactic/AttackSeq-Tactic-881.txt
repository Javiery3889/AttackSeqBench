### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers first gather network information using tools like ADFind and port scanning.
   - The next step involves propagating beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - **Discovery:** Gathering network information using ADFind and port scanning.
   - **Next Action:**
     - Propagating beacons to other systems within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This is the initial phase where attackers gather information about the network. However, the question asks about the next step after this initial discovery.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a system. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't specifically align with the propagation of beacons to other systems.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this is a crucial part of an attack, it doesn't directly describe the propagation of beacons.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within the network. Propagating beacons to other systems is a clear indication of lateral movement, as the attackers are attempting to spread their presence across the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of propagating beacons to other systems, is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement**
