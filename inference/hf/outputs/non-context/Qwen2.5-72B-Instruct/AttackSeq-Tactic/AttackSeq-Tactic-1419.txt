### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses DLL side-loading to execute the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
   - The next step in the sequence is the configuration of a Service + Run Key for maintaining access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **DLL Side-Loading:** This is a technique where an attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, causing the legitimate application to load and execute the malicious code.
   - **Execution of PlugX RAT:** The malicious DLL, once loaded, executes the PlugX RAT.
   - **Service + Run Key Configuration:** The PlugX RAT is configured to create a service and a run key to ensure it persists across system reboots.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the attack. While lateral movement can occur after initial access, it is not a necessary step before configuring persistence.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While privilege escalation can be useful for configuring persistence, it is not a required step in the sequence described.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves causing damage or disruption to the system. Configuring persistence is not an impact action; it is a preparatory step to maintain access.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. Configuring a service and a run key is a clear example of persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after the PlugX RAT is executed via DLL side-loading, the next step is to configure persistence mechanisms to ensure the RAT remains on the system.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
