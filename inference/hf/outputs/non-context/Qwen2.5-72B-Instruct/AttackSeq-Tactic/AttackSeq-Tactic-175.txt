### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the Lazarus group's malware installs a hidden 'autoupdater' module.
   - This module communicates with a command and control (C2) server to download and execute additional payloads.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The 'autoupdater' module is installed and hidden, which suggests an effort to maintain a presence on the system.
   - The module communicates with a C2 server, which is a key aspect of maintaining control over the compromised system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While hiding the 'autoupdater' module could be part of defense evasion, it is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold on a system. Installing a hidden 'autoupdater' module that can download and execute additional payloads is a classic example of persistence.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to access systems. This is not directly related to the installation and communication of the 'autoupdater' module.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. While the 'autoupdater' module communicates with a C2 server, this is a result of the persistence mechanism already being established.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware first establishes persistence by installing the hidden 'autoupdater' module, which then communicates with the C2 server to download and execute additional payloads.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
