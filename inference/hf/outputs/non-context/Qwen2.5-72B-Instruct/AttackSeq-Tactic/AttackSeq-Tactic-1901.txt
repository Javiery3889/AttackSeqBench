### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for obfuscation, gathers basic system information, and returns the results to a C&C server at eye-watch[.]in.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Obfuscation:** The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' to obfuscate its code.
   - **Gathering System Information:** The malware collects basic system information.
   - **Communication with C&C Server:** The malware sends the collected information to a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. The fact that the malware is sending information to a C&C server (eye-watch[.]in) aligns with the C2 tactic.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's access. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.
   - **C: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up C&C servers. The question does not describe the setup of infrastructure but rather the use of an existing C&C server.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. While the malware is gathering system information, the primary action described is the communication with the C&C server, which is more aligned with C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the communication with the C&C server, which is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
