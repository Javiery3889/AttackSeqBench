### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the KerrDown DLL.
   - The actions include dropping the DLL in a directory, executing the payload directly in memory for Defense Evasion, and then attempting to download the final payload from a URL.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Dropping the KerrDown DLL in a directory.
   - **Second Action:** Executing the payload directly in memory for Defense Evasion.
   - **Final Action:** Attempting to download the final payload from a URL.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords. It does not fit the context of downloading a payload from a URL.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While the execution of the payload directly in memory is a form of Defense Evasion, the question specifically asks about the action of downloading the final payload from a URL.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. Downloading a payload from a URL is a common C2 activity, as it involves establishing a connection to a remote server to retrieve additional components.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. Downloading a payload from a URL is not a discovery activity.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the KerrDown downloader attempted to download the final payload from a URL, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
