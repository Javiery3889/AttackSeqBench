### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the group first engaged in reconnaissance by gathering credentials through phishing domains.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing persistence on systems.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** This is the initial step where the group gathers information, including credentials through phishing domains.
   - **Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to a system, which could include using the credentials gathered during reconnaissance.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system, which typically occurs after initial access.
   - **Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a system, which can occur after gaining initial access but is not necessarily a prerequisite for establishing persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Reconnaissance (gathering credentials) → **Initial Access** (using the credentials to gain access) → Establishing Persistence.
   - After gathering credentials through phishing (Reconnaissance), the next logical step is to use those credentials to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - Once initial access is gained, the group can then establish persistence on the systems.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
