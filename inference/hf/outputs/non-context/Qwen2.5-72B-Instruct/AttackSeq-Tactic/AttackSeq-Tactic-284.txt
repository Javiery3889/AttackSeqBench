### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before cybercriminals developed and sold hardware like PoS (Point of Sale) and ATM skimmers accompanied by training services on the Chinese underground market.
   - The key elements here are the development and sale of hardware and the provision of training services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support an attack, such as developing or acquiring tools, infrastructure, and capabilities. Developing and selling hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services, aligns well with this tactic. The cybercriminals are creating the tools and services they need to carry out their attacks.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to support future operations. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the actual development of tools and services. It is more about understanding the target and the environment.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It is more relevant to the execution phase of an attack, not the preparation phase.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves stealing data from a target network. It is a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the initial compromise and data collection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the cybercriminals first needed to develop the necessary resources (hardware and training services) before they could use them in an attack. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Resource Development**
