### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where the attackers first used commands like `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration.
   - After enumeration, the attackers executed commands and injected processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Enumeration using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer`.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Execution of commands and process injection on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, the question does not mention any credential theft or access before the enumeration and remote execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This fits well with the description of executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers, which is a common lateral movement technique.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. The use of `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` for enumeration is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with the attackers using `whoami` and `Get-NetComputer` to gather information about the environment. This is clearly the Discovery tactic.
   - After discovering the environment, the attackers then move to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers using Cobalt Strike Beacon. This is a clear example of Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
