### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where BlueDelta conducted discovery activities to gather system information.
   - After the discovery, BlueDelta gained access to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery:** Gathering system information, such as network configuration and owner/user details.
   - **Access to Sensitive Files:** Gaining access to files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. It is typically used after gaining initial access and before or during the execution of other tactics. However, it does not directly align with the sequence of gathering system information and then accessing sensitive files.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials, which can be used to gain access to sensitive files. After discovering system information, an attacker might use this information to identify potential targets for credential access.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with compromised systems. It is usually established after gaining initial access and is not directly related to the sequence of discovery and accessing sensitive files.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves techniques to establish resources for use in campaigns, such as setting up infrastructure. It is typically a pre-attack activity and does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after discovering system information, the attacker would use this information to gain credential access, which would then allow them to access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Credential Access
