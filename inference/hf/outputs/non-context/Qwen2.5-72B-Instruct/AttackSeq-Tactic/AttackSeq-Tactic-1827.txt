### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Black Energy 2 malware.
   - The malware establishes communication with a C&C server using HTTP requests.
   - It receives encrypted configuration files.
   - The malware's plugins (ddos, syn, http) then create significant loads on target servers by generating mass connections and random data packets.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Communication:** The malware communicates with the C&C server.
   - **Configuration Reception:** The malware receives encrypted configuration files.
   - **Malicious Activity:** The plugins (ddos, syn, http) perform actions that create significant loads on target servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the malware establishing and maintaining communication with the C&C server.
     - While this is part of the sequence, it does not describe the final action of creating significant loads on target servers.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the effects of the malware's actions, such as denial of service (DoS) or degradation of services.
     - The plugins (ddos, syn, http) creating significant loads on target servers with mass connections and random data packets aligns with the Impact tactic.
   - **C: Persistence:**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time.
     - The described actions do not involve maintaining access but rather causing disruption.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the malware.
     - The described actions do not involve moving through a network but rather causing disruption on target servers.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the malware establishes communication and receives configuration files, it uses its plugins to create significant loads on target servers, which is a form of Impact.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Impact
