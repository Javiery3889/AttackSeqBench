### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker gains initial access via malicious installers or phishing campaigns.
   - The question then asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to ensure malicious operations across system reboots before the malware establishes communication with the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access to the system via malicious installers or phishing campaigns.
   - **Before C2 Communication:** The malware needs to ensure it can persist across system reboots.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains access to the system. However, it does not address the need to ensure malicious operations across system reboots.
   - **B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running the malicious code on the system. While it is a necessary step, it does not ensure persistence across reboots.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves ensuring that the malware remains on the system even after a reboot. This is the most relevant tactic for the question, as it directly addresses the need to maintain access across reboots.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. It is not relevant to ensuring persistence across reboots on the initial system.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the need to ensure malicious operations across system reboots, is the **Persistence** tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Persistence
