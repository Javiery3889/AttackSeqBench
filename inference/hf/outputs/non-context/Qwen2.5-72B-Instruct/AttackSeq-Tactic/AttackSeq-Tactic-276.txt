### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN8 conducted domain trust discovery and gathered system information.
   - The TTPs mentioned are:
     - Domain trust discovery using `nltest.exe`
     - Gathering system information using `systeminfo.exe` and `tasklist.exe`

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is also a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often following initial access and discovery.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often before initial access.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This is a crucial early stage in the attack lifecycle, often following initial access and before lateral movement or persistence.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The TTPs mentioned (domain trust discovery and gathering system information) are clear indicators of the Discovery phase. These actions are typically performed to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   - Before conducting these discovery actions, the adversary would likely have already gained initial access to the system. The next logical step would be to discover the environment to plan further actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Discovery
