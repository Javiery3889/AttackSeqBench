### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already established persistence using a scheduled task named 'Windows Update'.
   - The next step in the sequence is gathering detailed system information, such as the hostname and OS version.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access and often after gathering some initial information. However, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing persistence.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. It is a logical next step after establishing persistence, as attackers need to understand the environment they are in to plan further actions.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it can occur at various stages, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing persistence and before gathering system information.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system. The question already states that persistence has been established, so this is not the next step.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers would perform **Discovery** after establishing persistence and before gathering detailed system information.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
