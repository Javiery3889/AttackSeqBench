### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in the ProjectM campaign.
   - The campaign concealed infrastructure using WHOIS protection services and linked domains.
   - These actions were used to deliver additional payloads like Andromeda.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Concealment of Infrastructure:** This involves using WHOIS protection services to hide the true ownership and details of the infrastructure.
   - **Linking Domains:** This involves setting up and linking multiple domains to support the attack.
   - **Delivery of Additional Payloads:** This involves using the concealed infrastructure to deliver malware like Andromeda.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Concealing infrastructure and linking domains can be seen as a form of defense evasion, as it makes it harder for defenders to trace the attack back to the adversary.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. The question does not mention any impact on systems or data, so this is less likely.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. While setting up and linking domains is a form of resource development, the question specifically mentions the use of these resources to deliver payloads, which is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The question mentions the delivery of additional payloads, which often requires C2 to manage the infected systems and deliver the payloads.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after concealing infrastructure and linking domains, the adversary would use these resources to establish command and control over the infected systems to deliver additional payloads like Andromeda.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
