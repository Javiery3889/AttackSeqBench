### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Obtaining SSH access.
     - Using `wget` to fetch malware samples.
     - Deploying the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk.
     - Hiding the Turbo Linux Kernel Module from detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is likely the first step where the adversary gains initial access to the system, possibly through SSH.
   - **Execution:** After gaining access, the adversary uses `wget` to fetch malware samples, which is an execution step.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** Deploying the Turbo Linux Kernel Module to disk and hiding it from detection are techniques used for persistence and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the initial step where the adversary gains access to the system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after obtaining SSH access.
   - **B: Execution:** This is the step where the adversary uses `wget` to fetch malware samples, which is a logical next step after gaining access.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, which typically happens before the actual attack begins. It does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence provided. The sequence already assumes SSH access has been obtained.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Initial Access (SSH access).
     2. Execution (using `wget` to fetch malware samples).
     3. Persistence and Defense Evasion (deploying and hiding the Turbo Linux Kernel Module).
   - The tactic that most likely occurred after obtaining SSH access and before deploying the Turbo Linux Kernel Module is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
