### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading detection using digital certificate-signed backdoors.
     - Encrypting gathered data in log files.
     - Targeting stored secrets and credentials from various browsers and email services.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. While this is a common tactic, the question does not specifically mention moving to other systems or networks.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The use of digital certificate-signed backdoors and encrypting data are examples of defense evasion.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to systems over extended periods. While this is a crucial tactic, the question does not focus on maintaining access.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets. The question specifically mentions targeting stored secrets and credentials from browsers and email services, which aligns with this tactic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
