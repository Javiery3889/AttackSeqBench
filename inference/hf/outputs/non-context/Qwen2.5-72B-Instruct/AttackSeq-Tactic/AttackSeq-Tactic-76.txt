### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the threat actor initially gains access through malicious RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets.
   - After gaining initial access, the threat actor uses AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 (Command and Control) host and hide their identity.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor gains initial access using malicious RTF documents or Excel spreadsheets.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The threat actor uses AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual C2 host and hide their identity.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This choice aligns with the use of AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to the C2 host. The purpose of this action is to establish and maintain control over the compromised system, which is a key aspect of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This choice does not fit the described sequence. Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on the compromised system, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - This choice involves maintaining long-term access to the compromised system. While persistence is a common tactic, the use of AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic is more directly related to Command and Control.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - This choice is already covered by the initial exploitation of vulnerabilities via malicious documents. The use of AWS Global Accelerator occurs after initial access has been gained.

### Final Reasoning
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the threat actor uses AWS Global Accelerator to establish and maintain Command and Control over the compromised system. This aligns with the ATT&CK tactic of Command and Control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Command and Control
