### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Disttrack dropper.
   - The dropper installed a communications and wiper module.
   - It attempted to spread to other systems on the network.
   - The system was rendered unusable by overwriting its MBR and files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred after the dropper installed the modules and attempted to spread but before the system was rendered unusable.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that affect the availability or integrity of systems and data, such as data destruction or system shutdown. This is what happens when the MBR and files are overwritten, rendering the system unusable. However, this occurs after the system is already compromised and spread attempts are made.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - The Persistence tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems over extended periods. This could be relevant if the dropper was setting up mechanisms to ensure it can regain access, but the question does not indicate this.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This could be relevant if the dropper was gathering information to spread to other systems, but the question implies that the spread attempt has already been made.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. This is likely the most relevant because the dropper has installed a communications module, which is typically used for C2.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after the dropper installed the communications and wiper module and attempted to spread, the next logical step would be to establish Command and Control to manage the compromised systems.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
