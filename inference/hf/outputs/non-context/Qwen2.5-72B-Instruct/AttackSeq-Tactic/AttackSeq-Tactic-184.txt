### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where attackers have created scheduled tasks named 'Google-Updates' and 'Google-Update' to maintain persistence using downloaded payloads and scripts.
   - The key phrase is "after the attackers created scheduled tasks to maintain persistence."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The creation of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence is a clear indication of the **Persistence** tactic.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this persistence mechanism was established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is often used in conjunction with persistence, it is not necessarily the next step after establishing persistence.
   - **B: Persistence** - This is the tactic that is already described in the question. The question asks what happens **after** persistence is established, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves techniques to steal and transfer data out of the network. It is a logical next step after establishing persistence, as the attackers might want to gather and exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. While it can occur after persistence, it is not as directly linked to the next step as exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After establishing persistence, the attackers are likely to focus on achieving their ultimate goal, which often involves exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is **Exfiltration**.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
