### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have already evaded defenses using process hollowing and obfuscation.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is what we need to determine.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Evasion:** The attackers used process hollowing and obfuscation to evade defenses.
   - **Next Step:** We need to identify what the attackers are likely to do after evading defenses.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. This is a common next step after gaining initial access and evading defenses, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker's infrastructure. This is a critical step after evading defenses, as the attackers need to control the compromised system.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is typically done before the attack, not after evading defenses.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the compromised system and network. This is a logical next step after evading defenses, as the attackers need to understand the environment to plan further actions.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After evading defenses, the attackers would likely want to establish a command and control channel to control the compromised system. This is a critical step to maintain and expand their foothold.
   - However, before establishing C2, the attackers might first need to discover the environment to understand what they have access to and what they can do next.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - While both Command and Control and Discovery are plausible, Discovery is the most immediate and logical next step after evading defenses.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
