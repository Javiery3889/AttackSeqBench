### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers:
     - Moving their C&C (Command and Control) domains to new IP addresses.
     - Releasing a new version of the malware.
     - Attempting to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Moving C&C domains to new IP addresses: This is a technique to maintain control over the compromised systems and avoid being blocked or detected.
   - Releasing a new version of the malware: This is often done to bypass existing security measures and continue the attack.
   - Attempting to evade detection: This is a clear indication that the attackers are trying to avoid being identified and stopped.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. While moving C&C domains could be part of resource development, the focus here is more on evading detection and maintaining control, not on initial setup.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Moving C&C domains and releasing a new version of malware are both clear examples of defense evasion.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target. The actions described in the question are not about gathering information but about maintaining and advancing the attack.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. While moving C&C domains is related to command and control, the primary focus here is on evading detection, which is more aligned with defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
