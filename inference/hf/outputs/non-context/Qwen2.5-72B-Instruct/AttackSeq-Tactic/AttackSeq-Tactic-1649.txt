### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the SideCopy APT group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using decoy documents and honeytraps.
     - Utilizing modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Stage:** The use of decoy documents and honeytraps to lure victims.
   - **Final Stage:** The use of modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled system.
     - This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has collected and prepared the data for transfer.
     - It is unlikely to occur before the use of modular plugins for data collection.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts.
     - This is a crucial step after gaining initial access and before performing more advanced actions like file enumeration and data collection.
     - It fits well in the sequence between the initial lure and the use of modular plugins.

   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system, such as files, credentials, and other sensitive information.
     - This is a step that occurs after the attacker has discovered the system and before exfiltration.
     - It is a plausible step, but it might be more specific to the use of modular plugins rather than a separate phase.

   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack begins.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often occurring before the initial compromise.
     - It is less likely to occur after the use of decoy documents and honeytraps.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     - Initial Stage: Using decoy documents and honeytraps to gain initial access.
     - Intermediate Stage: Performing Discovery to understand the target environment.
     - Final Stage: Using modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
