### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where HIDDEN COBRA used spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords to break into online stores.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Spearphishing**: This is a technique used to gain initial access to a target's system.
     - **Obtaining retail staff passwords**: This is a result of the spearphishing attack, which allows the attacker to gain initial access to the online stores.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence. Spearphishing is a common technique used for initial access, where the attacker gains the initial foothold in the target's network.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. While persistence is a crucial step, it typically follows initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It usually follows initial access and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves techniques used to steal data from the compromised system. It is typically one of the final steps in the attack sequence, following initial access, persistence, and command and control.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the spearphishing attack. Since the spearphishing attack is used to gain initial access, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to establish persistence to maintain access to the compromised system.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
