### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where BlueDelta exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - The exploitation involved executing scripts that redirected incoming emails and impersonated victims to authenticate to other services.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** This is the initial step where BlueDelta exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - **Execution of Scripts:** Scripts were executed to redirect incoming emails.
   - **Impersonation:** The scripts impersonated victims to authenticate to other services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. While the exploitation of vulnerabilities is part of initial access, the question implies that the initial access has already been achieved and the focus is on what happened next.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. Impersonating victims to authenticate to other services is a form of credential access.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the system. Redirecting incoming emails could be part of collection, but the primary focus here is on the impersonation and authentication.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While redirecting emails and impersonating victims can be part of defense evasion, the primary focus is on the authentication aspect.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access and executing scripts to redirect emails, the next step is to use the credentials of the victims to authenticate to other services. This aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
