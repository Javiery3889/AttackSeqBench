### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries use Cobalt Strike to execute malicious payloads.
   - The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that involves the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 (Command and Control) method used in the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Deployment of "Listeners" to configure C2.
     2. Execution of malicious payloads using Cobalt Strike.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that adversaries take to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the deployment of C2 infrastructure.
   - **B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves the techniques adversaries use to run malicious code on a target system. While this is part of the sequence, it is not the initial step of configuring C2.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - The Privilege Escalation tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system. This is not directly related to the deployment of C2 infrastructure.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques used to gain a foothold in the target network. This can include setting up C2 infrastructure, such as deploying "Listeners" to configure the C2 method.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the deployment of "Listeners" to configure the C2 method, which is a part of the Initial Access tactic. This is followed by the execution of malicious payloads using Cobalt Strike.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
