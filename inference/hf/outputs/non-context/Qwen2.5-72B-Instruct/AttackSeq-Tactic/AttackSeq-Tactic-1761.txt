### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already achieved privilege escalation using a fileless UAC bypass and has injected code into Notepad.exe.
   - The next step involves techniques such as process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process to bypass detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - Privilege Escalation (UAC bypass)
     - Code Injection (into Notepad.exe)
   - **Next TTP:**
     - Techniques involving process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process to bypass detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim system, which is not directly related to bypassing detection or maintaining stealth.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation has already been achieved, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and not directly related to bypassing detection.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis, which aligns with the described techniques of process hollowing and code injection into a suspended process.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that the next tactic involves Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
