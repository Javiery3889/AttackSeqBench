### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence starts with deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers.
   - The sequence ends with the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware on the target systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target system. The deserialization attacks to exploit internet-facing Windows IIS servers are part of the initial access phase. Therefore, this tactic has already occurred.
   - **Privilege Escalation (B):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. While this could be a plausible next step, it is not necessarily the most immediate action after gaining access through deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. Given that the sequence ends with the execution of sophisticated memory-resident malware, it is logical that the execution of this malware is the next step after gaining access.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the target system. While this is a common next step, it typically follows the execution of the initial payload.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with gaining access through deserialization attacks and ends with the execution of memory-resident malware.
   - The most logical and immediate next step after gaining access is to execute the malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred between gaining access and executing the malware is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
