### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers gained initial access through malicious RTF files.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic occurred after gaining initial access and before the malware employed obfuscation to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through malicious RTF files.
   - **Obfuscation:** Used to evade detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. This includes obfuscation, which is mentioned in the question. However, the question asks what occurred before obfuscation, so this is not the correct answer.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and before or during the use of obfuscation. However, it is not the most immediate step after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. This is a logical step after gaining initial access through a malicious RTF file, as the attackers would need to execute the malware to proceed with their attack.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This typically occurs before the initial access and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through a malicious RTF file, the attackers would execute the malware. This execution step is necessary before any further actions like obfuscation or lateral movement can occur.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
