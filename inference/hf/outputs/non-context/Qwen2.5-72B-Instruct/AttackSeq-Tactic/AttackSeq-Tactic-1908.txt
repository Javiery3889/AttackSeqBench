### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack:
     - Initial access was gained through compromised retail staff passwords.
     - Malicious scripts were injected into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
     - Stolen customer data was funneled to hijacked legitimate sites for disguise.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Compromised retail staff passwords.
   - **Malicious Script Injection:** Injecting scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Funneling stolen customer data to hijacked legitimate sites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials. While this might be part of the initial access phase, it does not describe the injection of malicious scripts into checkout pages.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. While this is relevant to the initial compromise, it does not describe the injection of scripts.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network. This is not relevant to the injection of scripts into checkout pages.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. While this is relevant to the final step of funneling data to hijacked sites, it does not describe the injection of scripts.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The injection of malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactional data is a technique that falls under the **Exfiltration** tactic. This is because the primary goal of injecting these scripts is to capture and exfiltrate sensitive data (customer transactional data) from the network.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
