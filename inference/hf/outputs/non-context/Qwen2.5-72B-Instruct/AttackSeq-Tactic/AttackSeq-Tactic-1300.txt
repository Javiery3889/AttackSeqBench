### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus Group used stolen credentials for lateral movement and infected new machines within the network during Operation Cobalt Kitty.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Stolen credentials for lateral movement.
     - Infection of new machines within the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not logically precede the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques that attackers use to gain a foothold in a network. This is the first step in an attack and is necessary before any other TTPs can occur. However, it does not directly lead to the use of stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves techniques that attackers use to gain information about the network, systems, and users. This is often a necessary step before lateral movement, as attackers need to know what systems and credentials are available to them.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques that attackers use to obtain credentials, such as passwords, tokens, or other forms of authentication. This is a crucial step before using stolen credentials for lateral movement.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence of events is:
     1. **Credential Access**: The attackers obtain the necessary credentials.
     2. **Lateral Movement**: The attackers use the stolen credentials to move laterally within the network.
     3. **Infection of new machines**: The attackers infect new machines within the network.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
