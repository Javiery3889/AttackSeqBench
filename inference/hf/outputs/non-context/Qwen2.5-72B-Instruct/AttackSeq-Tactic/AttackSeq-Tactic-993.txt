### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with gaining initial access through malvertising.
   - It then mentions the use of 'domain shadowing' with stolen registration credentials to configure malicious subdomains for filtering and redirection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with gaining initial access through malvertising.
   - **Domain Shadowing:** This technique involves using stolen credentials to create subdomains that appear legitimate but are controlled by the attacker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While domain shadowing can be used to evade detection, it is not the primary focus of the question.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target. The question does not mention data collection.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques to gain entry into the target network. The question starts with gaining initial access through malvertising, and domain shadowing is used to maintain and extend that access.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. The question does not mention the execution of code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence begins with gaining initial access through malvertising.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker uses domain shadowing to create and control malicious subdomains.
   - Domain shadowing is a technique that can be used to maintain and extend the initial access.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for the use of domain shadowing in this context is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
