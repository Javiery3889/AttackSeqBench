### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where malware achieves persistence by creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
   - After achieving persistence, the malware performs discovery by obtaining the user's name and targeting the explorer process.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence**: Creating a RunOnce key in the registry.
   - **Discovery**: Obtaining the user's name and targeting the explorer process.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**: This is the initial step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**: This involves moving to other systems within the network, which is not mentioned as occurring between persistence and discovery.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**: This involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker. It is a logical step after achieving persistence and before performing discovery, as the malware might need to receive commands or exfiltrate data.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This involves techniques to avoid detection. While it could occur at various points, it is not specifically mentioned as a step between persistence and discovery in the question.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After achieving persistence, the malware would likely need to establish a command and control (C2) channel to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.
   - The discovery phase, where the malware gathers information about the user and the system, would logically follow the establishment of a C2 channel.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
