### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where persistence was established by registering scheduled tasks that executed DESLoader every 15 minutes.
   - After persistence, the attackers performed internal network scanning and dumped credentials from AD servers and backup servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the internal network scanning and credential dumping.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**:
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is a logical step before performing internal network scanning and credential dumping, as the attacker needs to know what to target.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**:
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is important, it is not the primary focus before scanning and credential dumping.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**:
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the initial compromise. This typically occurs before gaining access and establishing persistence.
   - **D: Credential Access**:
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. While this is related to the final step of dumping credentials, it is not the primary focus before scanning the network.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after establishing persistence, the attackers would first perform Discovery to understand the network layout and identify potential targets.
   - This is followed by internal network scanning and credential dumping.

### Final Answer: A: Discovery
