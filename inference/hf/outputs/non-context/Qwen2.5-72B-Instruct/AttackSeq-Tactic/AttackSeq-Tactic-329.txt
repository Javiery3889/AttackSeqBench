### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Hidden Cobra group.
   - They used the CVE-2018-4878 Adobe Flash exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - This exploit was used to download the Bankshot DLL implant from a specific domain (falcancoin.io).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** The exploit in the Word document is used to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Exploit Execution:** The CVE-2018-4878 exploit is executed to leverage the vulnerability.
   - **Malware Download:** The Bankshot DLL implant is downloaded from the specified domain.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While this could happen after the initial compromise, it is not the immediate next step after downloading the implant.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system. This is a logical next step after the initial compromise and implant download, as the attacker would want to ensure they can maintain control.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources. This typically happens before the initial compromise, not after.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. The exploit execution and implant download are already part of the initial compromise, so this is not the next step.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After the initial compromise and the download of the Bankshot DLL implant, the most logical next step would be to ensure persistence on the victim's system. This allows the attacker to maintain access and continue their operations.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Persistence
