### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events related to the Stuxnet worm.
   - Stuxnet initially gained access to systems using malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic occurred after gaining access but before executing the malicious code on both local and remote systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where Stuxnet gains access to the system using malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** This is the step where the malicious code is actually run on the system.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This involves spreading the malware to other systems within the network.
   - **Exfiltration:** This involves sending data out of the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining access.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This involves spreading the malware to other systems, which is a plausible step after gaining access but before executing the code.
   - **Execution (C):** This is the step where the malicious code is run, which is the next logical step after gaining access and potentially after lateral movement.
   - **Exfiltration (D):** This is a later step in the attack sequence, typically after the malicious code has been executed and data has been collected.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step after gaining access and before executing the code is **Lateral Movement**. This is because Stuxnet would likely spread to other systems to maximize its impact before executing its payload.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
