### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before APT10 deployed malware for long-term remote access and performed internal reconnaissance.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned includes:
     - Deployment of malware (e.g., PlugX or Quasar RAT) for long-term remote access.
     - Internal reconnaissance to establish a foothold on the network.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - Execution is the tactic where the adversary runs the malicious code on the target system. This typically occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic where the adversary gains the initial foothold in the network. This is a prerequisite for deploying malware and performing internal reconnaissance.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection is the tactic where the adversary gathers data from the target system. This typically occurs after gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - **D: Impact**
     - Impact is the tactic where the adversary disrupts the availability of or destroys systems and data. This is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - For APT10 to deploy malware and perform internal reconnaissance, they must first gain initial access to the network.
   - Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence, followed by Execution (running the malware), and then internal reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before deploying malware and performing internal reconnaissance is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
