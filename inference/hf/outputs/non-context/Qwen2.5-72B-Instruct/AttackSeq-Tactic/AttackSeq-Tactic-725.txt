### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the Komplex Binder and Komplex Dropper.
   - The Komplex Binder opens a decoy PDF file to distract the user.
   - The Komplex Dropper ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Komplex Binder opens a decoy PDF file to distract the user.
   - **Final Event:** Komplex Dropper ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence is the final event in the sequence, where the Komplex Dropper ensures the malware remains on the system.
     - This cannot be the tactic that occurred between the initial and final events.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system.
     - This could be a plausible step between opening the decoy PDF and ensuring persistence, but it is not the most likely based on the context.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
     - This is a likely step between opening the decoy PDF and ensuring persistence, as the malware would need to evade defenses to successfully establish persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack and less likely to occur between opening the decoy PDF and ensuring persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred between the Komplex Binder opening the decoy PDF and the Komplex Dropper ensuring persistence is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the malware would need to evade detection to successfully create directories and modify file permissions.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
