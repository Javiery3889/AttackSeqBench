### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FastPOS, specifically keylogging and RAM scraping to steal sensitive information.
   - The focus is on the immediate transmission of stolen credit card data, particularly those with valid service codes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Keylogging and RAM Scraping:** These are techniques used to collect sensitive information from the victim's system.
   - **Immediate Transmission of Stolen Data:** This implies that the stolen data is being sent to the attacker's server or command and control (C2) infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While keylogging and RAM scraping fall under this category, the question specifically asks about the transmission of the data, which is a subsequent step.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is not relevant to the immediate transmission of stolen data.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system and communicating with it to exfiltrate data. The immediate transmission of stolen data aligns with the C2 tactic.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial methods used to gain entry into the victim's system. This is not relevant to the transmission of stolen data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The keylogging and RAM scraping are part of the Collection phase.
   - The immediate transmission of stolen data is part of the Command and Control (C2) phase, as it involves sending the collected data back to the attacker's infrastructure.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
