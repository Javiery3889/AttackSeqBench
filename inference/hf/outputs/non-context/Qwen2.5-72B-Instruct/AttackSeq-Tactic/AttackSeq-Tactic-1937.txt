### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda.
   - The specific TTP in question involves delivering malicious documents with filenames related to current events, such as 'COVID-19 travel restrictions EU reviews list of third countries.exe'.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely involved in this step.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malicious tools. Delivering malicious documents is not a primary activity under this tactic.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining entry into the target network. Delivering malicious documents with enticing filenames to trick users into opening them is a common method of initial access, often through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While the execution of the malicious document is part of the attack, the delivery of the document itself is a different step.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target. Delivering malicious documents is not directly related to credential access.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The delivery of malicious documents with filenames related to current events is a common method used to gain initial access to a target system. This is typically done through phishing emails or other social engineering techniques.
   - The primary goal of this step is to get the user to open the malicious document, which then leads to the execution of the malware.
   - Therefore, the most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for this step is **Initial Access**.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
