### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving ShadowPad, a malware that was executed via DLL hijacking in a legitimate application.
   - After the execution, the attackers stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the execution of ShadowPad and the stealing of domain authentication credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial entry point of the malware into the network, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Execution:** This is the execution of ShadowPad via DLL hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** This is the stealing of domain authentication credentials.
   - **Persistence:** This involves maintaining access to the network over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the network. Since ShadowPad was already executed, this is not the correct choice.
   - **Persistence (B):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the network. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after execution and before credential access.
   - **Credential Access (C):** This tactic involves stealing credentials, which is exactly what the question states happened after the execution of ShadowPad.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic is about running the malware, which has already occurred.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after ShadowPad was executed via DLL hijacking, the attackers then stole domain authentication credentials to propagate further within the network. Therefore, the correct answer is **Credential Access**.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
