### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to drop first-stage malware.
     - Achieving persistence by adding registry run keys.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to drop first-stage malware. This is part of the **Exploitation for Client Execution** technique (T1203).
   - **Persistence:** The malware achieves persistence by adding registry run keys. This is part of the **Persistence** tactic, specifically the **Registry Run Keys/Items** technique (T1547.001).

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or gathering information. It typically occurs before the actual exploitation.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. It is mentioned in the question as the final step, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on the target system. The initial exploit to drop the first-stage malware falls under this category.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to access systems. It is not mentioned in the sequence described in the question.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Exploitation for Client Execution** (T1203) to drop the first-stage malware.
     2. **Execution** of the dropped malware.
     3. **Persistence** by adding registry run keys.
   - The step that occurs after the initial exploit and before achieving persistence is the **Execution** of the dropped malware.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
