### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers achieve initial access through spear phishing emails containing compressed files with malware executables.
   - The emails are disguised as payment documents and are sent to specific targets.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with the attackers sending targeted emails.
   - The emails are designed to look like payment documents to trick the recipients.
   - The recipients are likely to open the emails and the compressed files, leading to the execution of malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it occurs after the initial access is achieved, not before.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. Given that the emails are targeted and disguised as payment documents, it is likely that the attackers had prior knowledge about the target's business processes and individuals to make the emails convincing.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves establishing resources to support the attack, such as creating malicious documents or setting up infrastructure. While this is a necessary step, it is not the most immediate precursor to the spear phishing emails.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system over time. This is a step that occurs after initial access is achieved, not before.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers first conducted **Reconnaissance** to gather information about the target, which allowed them to craft convincing spear phishing emails disguised as payment documents.
   - After the reconnaissance, the attackers sent the targeted emails, leading to the initial access through the spear phishing attack.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
