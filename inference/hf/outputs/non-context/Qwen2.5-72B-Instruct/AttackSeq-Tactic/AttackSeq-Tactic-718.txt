### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Aria-body backdoor and the Naikon APT group.
   - The backdoor gathered system information, collected files, screenshots, and metadata.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic was most likely used to facilitate communication with the C&C server for receiving commands and sending stolen data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - Gathering system information.
     - Collecting files, screenshots, and metadata.
   - **Next Step:**
     - Facilitating communication with the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system, which has already been described in the question (collecting files, screenshots, and metadata).
     - This is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system.
     - While this might be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to facilitating communication with the C&C server.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network.
     - This has already been described in the question (gathering system information).
     - This is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **D: Command and Control:**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the C&C server to receive commands and send stolen data.
     - This aligns perfectly with the next step in the sequence described in the question.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence of actions described in the question involves initial data collection and system information gathering.
- The next logical step is to establish communication with the C&C server to receive further commands and exfiltrate the collected data.
- The ATT&CK tactic that best fits this next step is **Command and Control**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
