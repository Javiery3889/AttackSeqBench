### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already obtained valid credentials for lateral movement.
   - The next step in the sequence is to locate relevant systems, users, and data before collecting the data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Obtained Valid Credentials:** This aligns with the "Credential Access" tactic.
   - **Locate Relevant Systems, Users, and Data:** This step involves identifying the targets within the network.
   - **Collection of Data:** This is the final step where the data is gathered.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic is about obtaining the credentials, which has already been completed in the sequence described.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access other systems, but it is not the step of locating the relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand the environment, locate systems, and identify valuable data. This aligns perfectly with the step of locating relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering the data, which is the final step after the relevant systems and data have been located.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the "Discovery" tactic occurred to locate relevant systems, users, and data.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
