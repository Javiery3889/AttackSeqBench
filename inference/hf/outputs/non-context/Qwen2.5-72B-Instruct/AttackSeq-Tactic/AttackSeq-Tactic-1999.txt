### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attacker has already configured the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using a compromised router as a proxy server.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next as the final stage of the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the configuration of the C2 infrastructure.
   - The question implies that this is not the final stage of the attack, and we need to determine the next and final stage.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems and resources. This is typically done after gaining initial access and setting up C2 infrastructure, but it is not usually the final stage of an attack.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic of communicating with and controlling compromised systems. The question states that the C2 infrastructure has already been configured, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials such as usernames and passwords. This is often done to gain initial access or to facilitate lateral movement, but it is not typically the final stage of an attack.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of stealing and transferring data from the compromised network to an external location. This is often the final stage of an attack, as the attacker's goal is to obtain and remove valuable data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the C2 infrastructure has already been set up, the most logical next and final stage of the attack would be to exfiltrate the data.

### Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
