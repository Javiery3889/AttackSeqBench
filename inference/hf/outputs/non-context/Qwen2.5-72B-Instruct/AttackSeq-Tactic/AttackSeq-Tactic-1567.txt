### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Konni APT.
   - The sequence involves:
     - Using obfuscated scripts to manage the deletion of evidence (e.g., 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs').
     - Using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This typically occurs after initial access and often after some form of discovery or privilege escalation.
     - The question does not mention any lateral movement activities, so this is less likely to be the correct answer.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system and network. This is a logical step after initial access and before any further actions like lateral movement or data exfiltration.
     - The use of 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The deletion of evidence using obfuscated scripts is a clear example of defense evasion.
     - However, the question asks what tactic occurred **after** the deletion of evidence and **before** the discovery of system details.
   - **D: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This typically occurs later in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has achieved their objectives.
     - The question does not mention any impact activities, so this is less likely to be the correct answer.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Defense Evasion**: Using obfuscated scripts to delete evidence.
     2. **Discovery**: Using 'versioninfo.bat' to discover system details.
   - The tactic that fits between these two steps is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
