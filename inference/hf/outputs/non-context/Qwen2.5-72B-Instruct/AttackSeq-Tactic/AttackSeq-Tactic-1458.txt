### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker has already set up persistence through a scheduled task named PolicyConverter.
   - The next step in the sequence is communicating with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control (C2) servers, acquiring domains, and creating accounts. This typically happens before the initial compromise and is not likely to occur between setting up persistence and communicating with compromised websites.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the target system, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a common step after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence or exfiltrating data. However, it is less likely to occur after setting up persistence and before communicating with compromised websites.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the attacker stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to an external location. This typically happens after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly after setting up persistence. However, it is not a necessary step before communicating with compromised websites.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system by establishing a communication channel. This is a crucial step after setting up persistence, as the attacker needs to maintain control and issue commands to the compromised system. Communicating with compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests is a common method of C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred between setting up persistence and communicating with compromised websites is Command and Control (C2).

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
