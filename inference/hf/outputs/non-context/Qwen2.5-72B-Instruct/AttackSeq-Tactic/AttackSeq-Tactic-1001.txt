### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where files are executed, a first-stage downloader retrieves a PlugX file, and the PlugX file connects to a C2 domain.
   - The key events are:
     - Execution of files in the `%Temp%` directory.
     - Retrieval of a first-stage downloader.
     - Connection to a C2 domain.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the described sequence of events, which involves initial access and command and control activities.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. While the connection to the C2 domain is part of the sequence, it is a later step. The question asks about what occurred before the files were executed and the C2 connection was established.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing, drive-by downloads, or other methods to execute initial payloads. The execution of files in the `%Temp%` directory and the retrieval of a first-stage downloader are typical actions that occur during initial access.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges. While credential access can be part of an attack, it is not typically the first step in the sequence described, which involves initial file execution and C2 communication.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that the Initial Access tactic occurred before the files were executed and the C2 connection was established.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
