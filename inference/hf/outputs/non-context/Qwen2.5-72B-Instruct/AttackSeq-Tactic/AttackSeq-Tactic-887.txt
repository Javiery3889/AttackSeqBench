### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Mimikatz for credential theft**: This is a tool used to steal credentials, which falls under the **Credential Access** tactic.
     - **Logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts**: This involves using the stolen credentials to access the network, which is part of the **Lateral Movement** tactic.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. This is not directly related to the sequence of using Mimikatz to steal credentials and then logging in using those credentials.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is not relevant to the sequence of stealing credentials and using them to log in.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through the network to access other systems. This is a logical next step after obtaining valid credentials, as the attackers would use these credentials to log in to the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is what Mimikatz is used for. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **after** credential theft and **before** logging in, so this is not the correct choice.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after APT10 used Mimikatz to steal credentials (Credential Access), they then used those credentials to log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers (Lateral Movement).

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
