### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where UNC1151 initially gained access through spear phishing campaigns using malicious attachments.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves stealing victim credentials via spoofed websites.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the victim's network, typically through spear phishing with malicious attachments.
   - **Credential Access:** This is the step where the attacker attempts to steal credentials, which in this case is done via spoofed websites.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the victim's network and sending it to an external location. This is not relevant to the step of stealing credentials via spoofed websites.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to steal credentials, which aligns with the use of spoofed websites to trick victims into providing their credentials.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's network and systems. While this is a common step in many attacks, it does not specifically align with the act of stealing credentials via spoofed websites.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial entry into the victim's network, which has already been described as occurring through spear phishing with malicious attachments. This is not the step where credentials are stolen via spoofed websites.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Credential Access
