### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers gained initial access to a victim's system by exploiting CVE-2018-8174 via a watering hole attack.
   - After gaining access, the attackers used a downloader to leverage CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2018-8174 via a watering hole attack.
   - **Local Privilege Escalation:** Leveraging CVE-2015-1701 using a downloader.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after the initial access and before or during the execution of further actions. However, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the first step (exploiting CVE-2018-8174 via a watering hole attack). It cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely need to execute the downloader to leverage CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation. This is a logical next step.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. While it can occur at various stages, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access and before executing a downloader for privilege escalation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is: Initial Access (via CVE-2018-8174) → Execution (of the downloader) → Local Privilege Escalation (via CVE-2015-1701).
   - The tactic that fits between gaining initial access and leveraging the downloader for privilege escalation is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Execution
