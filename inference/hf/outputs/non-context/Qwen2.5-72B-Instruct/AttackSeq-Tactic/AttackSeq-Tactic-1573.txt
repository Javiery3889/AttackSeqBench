### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where malicious documents were used in a phishing campaign to execute malware.
   - After the malware execution, it established communication with multiple C2 (Command and Control) domains.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial stage where the attacker gains entry into the system, often through phishing or other means.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed on the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware establishes communication with the attacker's server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains initial access through phishing. However, the question is asking about the next step after the malware is executed.
   - **Answer Choice B: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the attacker causing damage or disruption, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is not the immediate next step after establishing communication with C2 domains.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This is the most logical next step after the malware is executed. The malware needs to communicate with the attacker's server to receive further instructions and potentially exfiltrate data.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. While this is a common next step, it typically follows the establishment of C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the malware established communication with multiple C2 domains, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
