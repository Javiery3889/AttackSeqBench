### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before FIN13 established a foothold in victim networks using exploited external servers and deployed web shells as a gateway.
   - The key elements are:
     - Establishing a foothold in victim networks.
     - Using exploited external servers.
     - Deploying web shells as a gateway.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the actual attack. This is typically the first step in any attack sequence.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is usually done after gaining initial access to the network.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. This is typically done after establishing a foothold.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry into the target network. This is the step where the attacker establishes a foothold, which aligns with the use of exploited external servers and web shells.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves establishing a foothold using exploited external servers and deploying web shells. This is a clear indication of the Initial Access phase.
   - Reconnaissance would have occurred before Initial Access, but the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before the described actions, which are part of Initial Access.
   - Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement are subsequent steps that would occur after Initial Access.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
