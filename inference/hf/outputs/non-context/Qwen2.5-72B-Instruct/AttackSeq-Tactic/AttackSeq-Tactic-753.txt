### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the threat actor "Kingslayer."
   - The sequence includes gaining access through a supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software.
   - The next step is configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through the supply-chain compromise of the Alpha software.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials to gain access to systems. While this could be a plausible step, it is not necessarily the most immediate step after gaining initial access through a supply-chain compromise.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the target system. This is typically a later step in the attack lifecycle, after the adversary has established a foothold and is ready to exfiltrate data.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, which has already been described as gaining access through the supply-chain compromise.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This is the step that occurs after the one we are trying to identify, where the adversary configures a diurnal beaconing algorithm to evade detection.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access through the supply-chain compromise, the next logical step would be to evade detection to maintain persistence and avoid being caught.
   - Configuring a diurnal beaconing algorithm is a technique used for defense evasion, which aligns with the described sequence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
