### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement to expand their control.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Stolen credentials were used.
     2. Lateral movement was performed to expand control.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not a logical next step after lateral movement.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most immediate next step after lateral movement.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement is the tactic already described in the question. It is the action of moving through the network to expand control, so it cannot be the next step after itself.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised systems. After gaining control of additional systems through lateral movement, the next logical step is to collect data from these systems to achieve the attacker's objectives.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after Whitefly used stolen credentials for lateral movement, they would likely engage in data collection to gather information from the newly compromised systems.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
