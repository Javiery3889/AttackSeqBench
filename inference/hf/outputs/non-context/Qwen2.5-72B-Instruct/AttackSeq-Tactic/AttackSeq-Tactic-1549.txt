### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gathering information about the victim's computer (OS version, username, anti-virus details).
     - Using a backdoor to send exfiltrated data (files and screenshots) over a C&C channel.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves the attacker's ability to communicate with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data.
     - This is a plausible choice because the backdoor is used to send exfiltrated data over the C&C channel, which is a part of the C2 tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack.
     - This is not a plausible choice because the information gathering has already been described as the first step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control.
     - This is not a plausible choice because the question does not mention any movement through the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system.
     - This is a plausible choice because the backdoor is used to exfiltrate data, which implies that the data has been collected before being sent.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question involves gathering information, then using a backdoor to exfiltrate data.
   - The step that most likely occurred between these two actions is the collection of data to be exfiltrated.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **Collection**.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
