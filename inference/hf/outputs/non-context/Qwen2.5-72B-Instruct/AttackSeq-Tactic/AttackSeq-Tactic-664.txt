### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where base64 blobs embedded in Office documents are used for execution.
   - The next step in the sequence is the dropping and execution of the KerrDown DLL in memory without being written to the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The use of base64 blobs embedded in Office documents suggests that the initial access vector is likely a phishing email or a malicious document.
   - **Execution:** The base64 blobs are executed, leading to the next stage.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The KerrDown DLL is dropped and executed in memory without being written to the system, which is a technique to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it could be a subsequent step, it is not the most likely immediate step after the initial execution.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing a communication channel with the attacker. While it is a crucial step, it typically follows the initial execution and defense evasion.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is already described by the use of base64 blobs in Office documents.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. The execution of the KerrDown DLL in memory without being written to the system is a clear example of defense evasion.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the KerrDown DLL was dropped and executed in memory as a form of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
