### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Hidden Cobra has already achieved persistence using the Bankshot implant.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to avoid detection and erase evidence of the implant.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The Bankshot implant is already in place and ensures the attacker can maintain access to the victim network.
   - **Next Step:** The attacker needs to avoid detection and erase evidence of the implant.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. This includes techniques like obfuscation, anti-forensic processes, and clearing logs. This aligns well with the need to avoid detection and erase evidence.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is not relevant to avoiding detection or erasing evidence.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is not relevant to avoiding detection or erasing evidence.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. The question already states that persistence has been achieved, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the need to avoid detection and erase evidence of the implant, is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
