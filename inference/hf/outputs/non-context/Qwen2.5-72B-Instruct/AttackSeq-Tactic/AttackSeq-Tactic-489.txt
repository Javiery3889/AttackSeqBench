### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Pierogi backdoor.
   - The backdoor first checks for antivirus and security products and uses techniques to evade detection.
   - After evading detection, it collects information about the infected machine, such as the computer name and operating system version.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Evasion (checking for antivirus and security products, using techniques to evade detection).
   - **Subsequent Action:** Collecting information about the infected machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they are operating in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information. Collecting the computer name and operating system version fits well within the Discovery phase.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary, such as documents, emails, and other files. While collecting information about the machine could be part of Collection, it is more specifically aligned with the Discovery phase.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the adversary moving data out of the network. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves the adversary altering the system to achieve their goals, such as destroying data or disrupting operations. This is also a later stage and does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the backdoor evading detection and then collecting information about the infected machine. The most appropriate ATT&CK tactic for collecting information about the environment is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: A: Discovery
