### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already established Command and Control (C2) using stealth methods like backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur **after** the C2 has been established.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating accounts, and gathering tools. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and C2 establishment.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as having been established. Therefore, it cannot be the next step.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts. This is a logical next step after establishing C2, as the attackers may need to move laterally within the network or access sensitive systems.
   - **D: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems, such as data destruction or denial of service. While this can occur after C2, it is often a final step in the attack sequence, and the question does not provide context suggesting immediate impact.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after establishing C2 would be to gain additional access, which aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
