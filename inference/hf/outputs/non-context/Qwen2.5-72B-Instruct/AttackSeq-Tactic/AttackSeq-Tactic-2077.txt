### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the BlackSoul malware.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. BlackSoul established communication with the C2 (Command and Control) server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding.
     2. BlackSoul exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data from a compromised system to an external location. This is the final step in the sequence, not the step that occurs between establishing C2 communication and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised system. This is a logical step that would occur after establishing C2 communication and before exfiltration. The malware would need to collect the data it intends to exfiltrate.
   - **Answer Choice C: Impact**
     - Impact involves altering the system to cause a desired effect, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is not a necessary step between establishing C2 communication and exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the initial step of establishing communication with the C2 server, which has already been mentioned in the question. Therefore, it cannot be the step that occurs between establishing C2 communication and exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackSoul collected data after establishing communication with the C2 server and before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: B: Collection**
