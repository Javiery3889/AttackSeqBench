### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the development and deployment of a new version of the Infy malware against a single Canadian target.
   - It also mentions that Unit 42 researchers gained control of the C2 (Command and Control) domains at a later stage.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Development and deployment of a new version of the Infy malware.
   - **Final Event:** Unit 42 researchers gaining control of the C2 domains.
   - We need to find the most plausible tactic that fits between these two events.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing malware. However, this would typically occur before the deployment of the malware, not after.
   - **B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running the malware on the target system. This would occur after the deployment of the malware but before the researchers gain control of the C2 domains.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this could occur after deployment, it is more likely to be a continuous process throughout the attack.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. This would occur after the initial deployment and execution of the malware, and before the researchers gain control of the C2 domains.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Resource Development** (development of the new version of Infy malware).
     2. **Deployment** (not explicitly mentioned in the ATT&CK tactics but implied).
     3. **Execution** (running the malware on the target system).
     4. **Persistence** (maintaining access to the target system).
     5. **Defense Evasion** (ongoing to avoid detection).
     6. **Unit 42 researchers gaining control of the C2 domains**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
