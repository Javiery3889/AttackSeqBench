### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the main component of the malware has been set up and is responsible for deploying additional spy modules.
   - The focus is on the next step in the attack sequence, which involves managing and coordinating communication with the malware infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The main component is already deployed and is capable of deploying additional spy modules.
   - The next logical step is to establish and maintain communication with the command and control (C2) infrastructure to manage the infected devices and receive further instructions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand the environment. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it is not the most relevant here because the main component is already deployed and the focus is on communication.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems. This is the most relevant choice because it directly addresses the need to manage and coordinate communication with the malware infrastructure.
   - **C: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised systems. While this is a common next step, it is not the primary focus of the question, which is on communication and control.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The main component has already been deployed, so this is not the next step in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **B: Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
