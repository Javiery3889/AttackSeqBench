### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already gained remote shell access, performed file manipulation, and recorded device interactions.
   - The next step involves using configuration data such as CnC (Command and Control) information and FTP credentials to send stolen keystroke data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this could be part of the initial stages of an attack, the question implies that the attacker already has access and is now using credentials for a specific purpose.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. The use of CnC information and FTP credentials to send stolen data aligns well with the C2 tactic.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support an attack, such as setting up CnC servers. This is typically done before the attack begins, not after gaining access and manipulating files.
   - **D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While execution is a crucial part of the attack, the question is focused on the communication and data exfiltration phase.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the attacker using CnC information and FTP credentials to send stolen keystroke data. This aligns most closely with the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic.
   - The other answer choices do not fit as well:
     - **Credential Access** is more about obtaining credentials, not using them to exfiltrate data.
     - **Resource Development** is about setting up the infrastructure, not using it.
     - **Execution** is about running code, not communicating with CnC servers.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
