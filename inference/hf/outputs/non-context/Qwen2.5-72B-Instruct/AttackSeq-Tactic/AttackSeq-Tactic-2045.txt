### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Iron Tiger has already gained access to the Mimi chat developer's backend and compromised its servers through a supply chain attack.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after this initial access and compromise.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. Iron Tiger gains access to the Mimi chat developer's backend.
     2. Iron Tiger compromises the servers through a supply chain attack.
     3. The next step in the attack sequence is what we need to identify.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves gathering and preparing resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. This typically occurs before gaining initial access, not after.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the compromised system. This is a plausible next step after gaining access and compromising the servers, as the attackers might want to steal sensitive information.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the target environment. This has already occurred in the scenario, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This is also a plausible next step after gaining access and compromising the servers, as the attackers might want to maintain their presence and avoid being detected.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Both Exfiltration and Defense Evasion are plausible next steps, but Exfiltration is more directly aligned with the goal of a supply chain attack, which often involves stealing sensitive information to use in further attacks or for financial gain.
   - Defense Evasion, while important, is more of a continuous process that occurs throughout the attack to maintain access and avoid detection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
