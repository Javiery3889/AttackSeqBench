### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has achieved persistence by installing QuasarRAT as a service and then decrypting the payload into memory.
   - The specific focus is on what happens when the encrypted payload is decrypted and executed in memory as "Client."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attacker has already achieved persistence by installing QuasarRAT as a service.
   - **Decryption and Execution in Memory:** The payload is decrypted and executed in memory.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While privilege escalation might be a part of the attack, the question specifically asks about the decryption and execution of the payload in memory, which is not directly related to privilege escalation.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. The decryption and execution of the payload in memory do not necessarily involve discovery.
   - **C: Persistence:** The question states that persistence has already been achieved by installing QuasarRAT as a service. The decryption and execution of the payload in memory are subsequent actions.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on the victim's system. Decrypting and executing the payload in memory is a clear example of the Execution tactic.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that the encrypted payload being decrypted and executed in memory as "Client" falls under the **Execution** tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
