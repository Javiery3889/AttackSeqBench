### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a phishing email containing a malicious XLS file.
   - The attackers then gain persistence using an MSI package that installs a malicious Lua script and establishes autorun via an LNK file.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the persistence was established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing email with a malicious XLS file.
   - **Persistence:** MSI package installs a malicious Lua script and sets up autorun via an LNK file.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for establishing persistence. It could occur before or after persistence, depending on the attack strategy.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the initial access, not between initial access and persistence.
   - **C: Persistence:** This is the tactic described in the question as the final step, so it cannot be the answer to what occurred before persistence.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code on the target system. After gaining initial access through the phishing email, the next logical step is to execute the malicious XLS file to gain a foothold on the system. This execution is necessary before the attackers can establish persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers first gain initial access through the phishing email, then execute the malicious XLS file to gain a foothold on the system, and finally establish persistence using the MSI package and LNK file.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
