### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Taidoor attackers gained initial access.
   - The Taidoor attackers used malicious documents (e.g., .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, .PPT) to exploit vulnerabilities and gain initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This is the tactic that describes the methods used to gain initial access to a system. Since the question already states that the attackers gained initial access using malicious documents, this cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It occurs after initial access has been gained, so it is not a plausible answer.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target system and network. While discovery can occur before initial access, it is not the most likely primary step before gaining initial access.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. Reconnaissance is a critical step that often precedes initial access, as attackers need to understand the target's environment to craft effective malicious documents.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers performed reconnaissance before gaining initial access.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
