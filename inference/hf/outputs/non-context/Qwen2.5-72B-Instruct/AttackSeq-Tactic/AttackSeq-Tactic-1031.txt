### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers gain credentials through phishing sites mimicking Instagram's interface.
   - After gaining the credentials, the attackers change account passwords and download all content from the compromised accounts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use phishing sites to gain initial access to the accounts.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers obtain the credentials through the phishing sites.
   - **Impact:** The attackers change the account passwords and download content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves the attackers obtaining the credentials through the phishing sites. This is a crucial step before they can change passwords and download content.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves the initial entry point into the system, which in this case is the phishing site. However, the question specifically asks about the step before changing passwords and downloading content, which is more aligned with obtaining the credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up the phishing site. This occurs before the initial access and is not the step immediately before changing passwords and downloading content.
   - **Answer Choice D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised accounts, which is the final step in the sequence described (downloading content).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers first gain initial access through the phishing site, then obtain the credentials (Credential Access), and finally change the passwords and download content.
   - Therefore, the step that most likely occurred before changing passwords and downloading content is **Credential Access**.

### Final Answer: A: Credential Access
