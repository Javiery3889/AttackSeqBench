### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker has established persistence using a scheduled task running the `mshta.exe` utility.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves establishing communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attacker has already established persistence using a scheduled task.
   - **Next Step:** The question asks about the next step, which involves communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the most likely next step after establishing persistence and before establishing communication with remote servers.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic has already been established in the question, so it is not the next step.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing communication with remote servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. This aligns perfectly with the next step described in the question.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving to other systems within the network. While it is a common step, it is not the most immediate next step after establishing persistence and before establishing communication with remote servers.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Persistence Established:** The attacker has already set up a scheduled task using `mshta.exe` to maintain malicious code execution.
2. **Next Logical Step:** The next logical step in the attack sequence is to establish communication with remote servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
3. **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic fits the description of establishing communication with remote servers for data exfiltration and control.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
