### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Cinobi compromises victims' web browsers to steal banking credentials and then downloads additional malware and configuration files from a .onion C&C address.
   - The key actions are:
     - Stealing banking credentials (form-grabbing and modifying web traffic).
     - Downloading various stages of malware and configuration files from a .onion C&C address.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords. While the initial action of stealing banking credentials fits this tactic, the question is asking about what happens afterward.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Downloading additional malware and configuration files from a C&C server is a typical C2 activity.
   - **C: Collection**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information from the target network. While the initial form-grabbing fits this tactic, the question is asking about the subsequent action of downloading files.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after stealing banking credentials, the next step is to download additional malware and configuration files from a C&C server. This aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
