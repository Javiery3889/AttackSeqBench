### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used Mimikatz to capture passwords and conducted targeted attacks with the core malware Anunak.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attackers employed RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Mimikatz for capturing passwords:** This is a technique under the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - **Targeted attacks with Anunak malware:** This is a technique under the **Execution** tactic.
   - **Employing RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to evade detection:** This is a technique under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (A):** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure and gathering information. It typically occurs before the actual attack begins and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While it is part of the sequence (using Anunak malware), it does not directly precede the use of RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools.
   - **Persistence (C):** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over an extended period. While it could be relevant, it is not the most immediate precursor to using RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools.
   - **Credential Access (D):** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as using Mimikatz to capture passwords. This is a crucial step that often precedes the use of legitimate remote access tools to maintain access and evade detection.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves capturing credentials using Mimikatz, which is a **Credential Access** technique. After obtaining the credentials, the attackers likely used these credentials to set up RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools to maintain access and evade detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that **Credential Access** occurred before the attackers employed RDPdoor and legitimate remote access tools.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
