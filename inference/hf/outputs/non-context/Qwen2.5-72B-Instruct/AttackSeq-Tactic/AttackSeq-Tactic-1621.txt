### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Earth Lusca group.
   - The group first acquired credentials using tools like Mimikatz and the ZeroLogon exploit.
   - After acquiring the credentials, the group scanned the compromised network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Credential Access (using Mimikatz and ZeroLogon exploit)
   - **Subsequent Action:** Scanning the network (using HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While scanning can be a precursor to lateral movement, the question specifically mentions scanning the network, which is more aligned with discovery.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves attempting to map the network and identify potential targets. Scanning the network with tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan is a clear example of discovery.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The question already states that credentials were acquired, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves establishing resources to support operations. Scanning the network does not fit this category.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The group has already acquired credentials, which falls under the **Credential Access** tactic.
   - The next step is to scan the network to understand the environment and identify potential targets, which falls under the **Discovery** tactic.
   - Scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan are used to gather information about the network, which is a clear indicator of the **Discovery** phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
