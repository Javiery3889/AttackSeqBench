### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the delivery of the NetTraveler Trojan through spear-phishing emails that exploit CVE-2012-0158.
   - It then mentions that lookalike news and military domains were used to facilitate communication with compromised systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The NetTraveler Trojan is delivered through spear-phishing emails, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a target system.
   - **Exploitation:** The spear-phishing emails exploit CVE-2012-0158, a known vulnerability, to gain access.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Lookalike news and military domains are used to communicate with the compromised systems, which is a typical C2 tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. However, the question is about the communication phase, not the preparation phase.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already covered by the spear-phishing emails and the exploitation of CVE-2012-0158. The question is asking about what happens after the initial access is gained.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system, which aligns with the use of lookalike domains to communicate with the compromised systems.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the theft of data from the compromised system. While this might occur later in the attack, the question specifically mentions communication, which is more aligned with C2.

### Final Reasoning
The use of lookalike news and military domains to facilitate communication with compromised systems is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) phase of the attack. This is the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
