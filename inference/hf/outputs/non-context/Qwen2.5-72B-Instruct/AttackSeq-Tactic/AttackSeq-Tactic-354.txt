### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes the use of encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute a custom VM-based payload.
   - After this, the attackers used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute a custom VM-based payload.
   - **Subsequent Step:** Network service scanning using tools like pscan and nmap.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While the use of encrypted PowerShell scripts can be a form of defense evasion, this tactic is more about the initial execution and not the next logical step in the attack sequence.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. This is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a presence, but it is not directly related to the next step of network service scanning.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. Using tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning is a clear example of the Discovery tactic. This is the most logical step after gaining initial access and executing a payload.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. While this is a common next step after discovery, the question specifically mentions network service scanning, which is more aligned with the Discovery tactic.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers used Discovery techniques (network service scanning) after executing the payload and before any lateral movement or persistence activities.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
