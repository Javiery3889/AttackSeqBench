### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers initially compromised the environment using Cobalt Strike's beacon.
   - After the initial compromise, the attackers gathered Active Directory information using tools like ADFind.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Using Cobalt Strike's beacon.
   - **Gathering Active Directory Information:** Using tools like ADFind.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic refers to the methods used to gain initial entry into the network. Since the question states that the initial compromise has already occurred using Cobalt Strike's beacon, this tactic is not applicable to the period after the initial compromise.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. After gaining initial access, attackers often need to escalate their privileges to perform more advanced actions, such as gathering sensitive information.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. While persistence is a common next step, it is not necessarily the immediate step after initial access and before gathering information.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion is important, it is not the primary focus between initial access and gathering Active Directory information.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step between initial access and gathering Active Directory information is **Privilege Escalation**. Attackers need to escalate their privileges to gain the necessary access to gather sensitive information like Active Directory details.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Privilege Escalation
