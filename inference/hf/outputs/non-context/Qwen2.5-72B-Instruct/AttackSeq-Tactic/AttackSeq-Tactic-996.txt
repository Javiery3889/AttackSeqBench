### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where CVE-2015-5119 is exploited through a malicious Flash file to execute shellcode.
   - The shellcode is used to install a payload.
   - The payload is then embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif', to avoid detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** CVE-2015-5119 is exploited using a malicious Flash file.
   - **Execution of Shellcode:** Shellcode is executed to install a payload.
   - **Embedding Payload in GIF:** The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While the execution of shellcode is part of the sequence, it does not specifically address the embedding of the payload in a GIF to avoid detection.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. Embedding the payload in a GIF to avoid detection is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target system. While discovery might occur earlier in the attack, it does not align with the specific step of embedding the payload in a GIF.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with the compromised system. While command and control might be established after the payload is installed, it does not align with the specific step of embedding the payload in a GIF.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Exploit (CVE-2015-5119):** The attacker uses a known vulnerability to gain initial access.
2. **Execution of Shellcode:** The shellcode is executed to install the payload.
3. **Defense Evasion (Embedding in GIF):** To avoid detection, the payload is embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
