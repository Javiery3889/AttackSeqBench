### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
   - The initial access was gained through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - The final step mentioned is achieving persistence by registering a binary to the startup shell.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains entry into the system. The question already states that initial access was gained through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013, so this is not the answer.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after the malware has been executed and the attacker has some level of control over the system. It is not the most immediate next step after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to propagate the malware.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the attacker running the malware on the system. Given that the initial access was through a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013, the execution of the malware would likely occur immediately after gaining initial access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the attacker would execute the malware to begin its propagation within the network. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
