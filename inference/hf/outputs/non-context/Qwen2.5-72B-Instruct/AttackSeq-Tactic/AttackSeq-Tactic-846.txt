### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by Longhorn's malware.
   - The malware has already used commands for remote control and customized plugins for Collection.
   - The next step involves protecting communications with C&C (Command and Control) servers using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Remote Control:** This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - **Collection:** This is a separate tactic where the malware gathers data.
   - **Protecting Communications:** This is also part of the **Command and Control** tactic, specifically the technique of using a custom cryptographic protocol to secure communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It does not align with the described sequence of protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the malware to control it. The use of a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS to protect communications is a key part of this tactic.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It does not align with the described sequence of protecting communications with C&C servers.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While the malware has already used customized plugins for Collection, the next step is to protect communications, which is part of Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the next step is to protect communications with C&C servers, which falls under the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
