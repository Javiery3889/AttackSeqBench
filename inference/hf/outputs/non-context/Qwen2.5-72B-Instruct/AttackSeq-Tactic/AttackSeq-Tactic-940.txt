### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the backdoor loaded the encrypted configuration file, decrypted it, and used SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Loading an encrypted configuration file.
     - Decrypting the configuration file.
     - Using SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The use of SSL to connect to C&C servers is a part of the C2 tactic.
     - However, the question asks about what happened before the backdoor connected to the C&C servers, so this is not the most likely answer.

   - **B: Defense Evasion:**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. Encrypting and decrypting configuration files can be a form of defense evasion to hide the true nature of the backdoor.
     - However, this tactic is more about avoiding detection rather than the initial steps of loading and decrypting the configuration file.

   - **C: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves the techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code on a target system. Loading and decrypting an encrypted configuration file are actions that typically occur during the execution phase.
     - This is a strong candidate because the backdoor needs to be executed to load and decrypt the configuration file before it can connect to the C&C servers.

   - **D: Persistence:**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems over extended periods. While persistence is important, it is not directly related to the initial steps of loading and decrypting the configuration file.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the backdoor must first be executed to load and decrypt the configuration file before it can connect to the C&C servers.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred before the backdoor loaded the encrypted configuration file, decrypted it, and used SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
