### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the XtremeRAT backdoor maintains and references configuration data for command and control.
   - The attacker then uses functionalities such as interacting with the victim via a remote shell and file manipulation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Maintaining and referencing configuration data for command and control.
   - **Subsequent TTPs:** Interacting with the victim via a remote shell and file manipulation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While reconnaissance is a crucial early stage, it does not fit the described scenario of interacting with the victim and manipulating files.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While file manipulation could be part of collection, the primary focus here is on interacting with the victim via a remote shell, which is more aligned with command and control.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While execution is a necessary step, the question focuses on the interaction and manipulation post-execution.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The described functionalities (remote shell and file manipulation) are typical actions performed during the command and control phase.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
