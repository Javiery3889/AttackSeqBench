### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of WMI event subscription for persistence and the execution of commands as the SYSTEM user by escalating privileges.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **WMI Event Subscription for Persistence:** This is a method used to maintain a foothold in the target system by creating a WMI event subscription that triggers a specific action (e.g., running a malicious script or executable).
   - **Executing Commands as SYSTEM User by Escalating Privileges:** This involves gaining higher-level permissions to execute commands with elevated privileges.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is exactly what is described in the second part of the sequence (executing commands as the SYSTEM user).
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system, which is already covered by the WMI event subscription.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the sequence described.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described is:
     1. **Persistence** (WMI event subscription)
     2. **Privilege Escalation** (executing commands as the SYSTEM user)
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events is **Privilege Escalation**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation
