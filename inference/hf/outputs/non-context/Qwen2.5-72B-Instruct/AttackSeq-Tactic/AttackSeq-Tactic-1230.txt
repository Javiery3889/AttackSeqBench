### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where a V1 server connects to V2's SMB (Server Message Block) service to perform sensitive operations during lateral movement within a compromised network.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. A V1 server connecting to V2's SMB service.
     2. Performing sensitive operations (lateral movement).

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. This is typically done after gaining access and before or during lateral movement, but it is not a prerequisite for the initial connection to the SMB service.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target network and systems. This is often done before any actual exploitation or lateral movement to understand the network topology and identify potential targets.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. This is typically done after gaining initial access and is part of the exploitation phase, not necessarily before the initial connection to the SMB service.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. This is the first step in the attack chain and is necessary before any lateral movement can occur.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - For the V1 server to connect to V2's SMB service and perform sensitive operations, the attacker must have already gained initial access to the network. This is a prerequisite for any lateral movement.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the V1 server connected to V2's SMB service is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
