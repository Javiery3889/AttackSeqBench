### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files and the subsequent alteration of PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files.
   - **Subsequent Event:** Alteration of PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Altering PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection is a clear example of Defense Evasion.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords. This does not fit the context of altering PostScript code to evade detection.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. The exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files is an example of Initial Access, but this is the initial event, not what happens after it.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions. This does not fit the context of altering PostScript code to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files is the initial access point.
   - After gaining access, the attackers need to perform actions to maintain their presence and avoid detection.
   - Altering PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection is a clear example of Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
