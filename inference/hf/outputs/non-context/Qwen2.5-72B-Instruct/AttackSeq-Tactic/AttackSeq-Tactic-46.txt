### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers have already compromised hosts and are using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware to collect information.
   - The next step in the sequence is that the attackers send commands and receive results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 (Command and Control) servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Compromised Hosts:** The hosts are already compromised.
   - **Information Collection:** Information is collected using UltraVNC.ini and mobile infostealer malware.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Commands are sent and results are received through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on the C2 servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the network or system. Since the hosts are already compromised, this step has already occurred and is not the next logical step.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The question explicitly mentions that commands are being sent and results are being received, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While exfiltration might occur after information collection, the question specifically mentions sending commands and receiving results, which is more aligned with Command and Control.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the compromised system. While discovery might occur before or after information collection, the question focuses on the communication aspect, which is more aligned with Command and Control.

### Final Reasoning
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Command and Control tactic occurred before the attackers sent commands and received results through HTTP requests to PHP scripts on their C2 servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
