### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the Chinese APT actors deployed a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute their malware payload.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Deployment of a dropper executable.
     - Use of DLL sideloading.
     - Execution of the malware payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. It typically occurs after the attacker has already gained access and executed their payload. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the tactic that occurred before the deployment of the dropper executable.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While it can occur before or after the deployment of a dropper executable, it is not a necessary prerequisite for deploying the dropper.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial entry into the target system. This is a critical step that must occur before any other actions, including the deployment of a dropper executable.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves the actual running of the malware payload. The deployment of the dropper executable via DLL sideloading is a method of execution, so this tactic is part of the same phase as the deployment.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The deployment of a dropper executable via DLL sideloading to execute the malware payload is part of the **Execution** phase.
   - However, before the dropper executable can be deployed, the attackers must have gained **Initial Access** to the target system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the **Initial Access** tactic occurred before the deployment of the dropper executable.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
