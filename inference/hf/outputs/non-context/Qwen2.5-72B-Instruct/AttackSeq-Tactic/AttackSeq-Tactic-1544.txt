### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
   - The DOCX documents utilized the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing emails are used to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Execution:** The malicious DOCX documents, when opened, execute the remote template technique to download and run the next stage of the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is the most likely next step after the initial access. The remote template technique is a method of execution, where the document retrieves and runs additional malicious code.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, not the step that occurs after the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - This typically occurs after the initial access and execution, but it is not the immediate next step after the remote template technique is used.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - This is a later stage in the attack, typically occurring after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly moved laterally within the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack described is that the attackers used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access, and then the malicious DOCX documents executed the remote template technique to retrieve and run the next stage of the attack.

**Final Answer: A: Execution**
