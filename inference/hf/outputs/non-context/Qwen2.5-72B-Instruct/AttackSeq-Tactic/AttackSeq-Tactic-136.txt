### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FamousSparrow uses `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the target system. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities, phishing, or other methods.
   - **Execution:** This is the step where the attacker runs commands or scripts to achieve their objectives, such as downloading and installing malware.
   - **Impact:** This is the final step where the attacker achieves their goal, such as data exfiltration or system disruption.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This is the step where the attacker gathers information about the target before launching the attack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution (A):** This is the step where the attacker runs commands to download and install the backdoor. However, this is the action described in the question, not the step before it.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This is the step where the attacker gains initial entry into the system. This must occur before the attacker can run commands to download and install the backdoor.
   - **Impact (C):** This is the final step where the attacker achieves their goal. It does not occur before the execution of commands.
   - **Reconnaissance (D):** This is the step where the attacker gathers information about the target. While it is a crucial step, it typically occurs before initial access, not immediately before the execution of commands.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gains initial access to the system, and then uses `cmd.exe` to run commands for downloading and installing the backdoor.

**Final Answer: B: Initial Access**
