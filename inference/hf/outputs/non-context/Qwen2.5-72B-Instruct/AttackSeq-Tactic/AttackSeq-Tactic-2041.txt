### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Dragonfly attackers.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. Gathering credentials and system information (Discovery).
     2. Using remote desktop protocol (RDP) to hop among systems (Lateral Movement).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that attackers use to gain a foothold in the network. This typically happens before any discovery or lateral movement.
     - This does not fit the sequence described, as the question states that credentials and system information have already been gathered.

   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that allow attackers to move through a network to expand their access. This is the final step mentioned in the question, where RDP is used to hop among systems.
     - This is the next step after gathering credentials and system information, but it is not the tactic that occurred between the two steps mentioned.

   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that allow attackers to gain information about the network, systems, and users. This is the first step mentioned in the question, where credentials and system information are gathered.
     - This does not fit the sequence because it is the initial step, not the step that occurs after discovery.

   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that allow attackers to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to use for further actions.
     - After gathering credentials and system information (Discovery), the next logical step would be to use those credentials to gain access to other systems, which is a part of the Credential Access tactic.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers used the credentials and system information gathered during Discovery to perform Credential Access before moving laterally using RDP.

**Final Answer: D: Credential Access**
