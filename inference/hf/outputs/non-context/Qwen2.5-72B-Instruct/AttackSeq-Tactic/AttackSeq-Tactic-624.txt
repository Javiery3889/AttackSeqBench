### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the adversary has already explored the target network to locate relevant systems using the **Discovery** tactic.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords. While this can occur after initial discovery, it is not the most immediate next step after discovering relevant systems.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery is the tactic that has already been performed, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is a logical next step after discovering relevant systems, as the adversary would want to move to those systems to further their objectives.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. While this can occur at various stages, it is not typically the immediate next step after discovery, especially if the adversary has not yet moved to the relevant systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of an attack, after the adversary has discovered relevant systems, the next most likely step is to move to those systems to expand their access. Therefore, the most plausible next tactic is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement**
