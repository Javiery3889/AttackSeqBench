### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in Suckfly's attack:
     - Scanning the corporate internal network for open ports.
     - Exfiltrating the victim’s data using the Nidiran back door.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after initial access and is used to send commands and receive data.
     - While C2 is crucial, it is not the most likely tactic to occur between scanning for open ports and exfiltrating data.

   - **B: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. Scanning for open ports is a form of discovery.
     - Discovery is a logical step after initial access and before exfiltration, as the attacker needs to understand the network to find valuable data and determine the best exfiltration method.

   - **C: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems and resources.
     - Lateral movement is a common step after discovery but is not necessarily the most immediate step before exfiltration.

   - **D: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim’s system.
     - Execution is typically an early step in the attack sequence, often used to establish a foothold or deploy additional tools. It is not the most likely step between scanning for open ports and exfiltrating data.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question suggests that the attacker first scans the network for open ports (a form of discovery) and then exfiltrates data using the Nidiran back door.
   - The most logical step between these two actions is further discovery to understand the network and identify valuable data to exfiltrate.
   - Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that occurred between scanning for open ports and exfiltrating data is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
