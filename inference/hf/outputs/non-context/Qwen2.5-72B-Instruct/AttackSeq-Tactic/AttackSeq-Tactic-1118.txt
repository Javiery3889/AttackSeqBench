### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving spear phishing emails delivering the Etumbot malware to targets.
   - It then mentions that the backdoor was configured to run at startup through registry modification.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing emails deliver the Etumbot malware to targets.
   - **Unknown Tactic:** The tactic we need to identify.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor is configured to run at startup through registry modification.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It typically occurs before the initial access, not between initial access and persistence.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. The question already states that the backdoor was configured to run at startup, which is a persistence technique. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While it is a valid tactic, it is not necessarily the most likely to occur immediately after initial access and before persistence.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to the target system, which has already been described as occurring through spear phishing emails. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Tactic:**
   - Given the sequence, the most likely tactic to occur after initial access and before persistence is **Collection**. After gaining access, the attacker would likely collect information to understand the environment and plan further actions, such as setting up persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Collection
