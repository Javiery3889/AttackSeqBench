### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by ATMitch, a malware known for its stealth and persistence.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Disguising the payload as a resource within the loader.
     - Using thread hijacking to avoid detection.
     - Operating by reading commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder.
     - Logging actions into 'c:\intel\__log.txt'.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the adversary communicating with the compromised system to control it.
     - The question mentions that ATMitch reads commands from a file, which could be a form of C2, but it is not the most immediate next step after thread hijacking and before reading commands.

   - **B: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers or creating malware.
     - This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they have compromised, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts.
     - After thread hijacking and before reading commands, the malware might need to discover the environment to determine what commands to execute and where to log actions.

   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to obtain credentials to access systems or accounts.
     - This is a common step in many attacks but is not necessarily the immediate next step after thread hijacking and before reading commands.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that after ATMitch uses thread hijacking to avoid detection, it would likely need to discover the environment to understand where to read commands and log actions.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred in this sequence is **Discovery**.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
