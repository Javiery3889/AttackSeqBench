### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Suckfly malware.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Making the malware difficult to analyze to avoid detection.
     2. Scanning the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Step 1: Making the malware difficult to analyze to avoid detection** - This aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Step 2: Scanning the corporate internal network for open ports to expand its foothold** - This aligns with the **Discovery** tactic, specifically the technique **Network Service Scanning**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It typically occurs before the malware is deployed and is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. It is not directly related to the sequence of making the malware difficult to analyze and scanning the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis, which matches the first step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. It is not directly related to the sequence of making the malware difficult to analyze and scanning the network.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with making the malware difficult to analyze to avoid detection, which is a **Defense Evasion** tactic. The next step is scanning the network, which is a **Discovery** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between these two steps is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
