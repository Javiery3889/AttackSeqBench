### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where 'Surtr' ensures persistence by adding registry keys and storing C2 information for execution during system restarts.
   - After ensuring persistence, 'Surtr' connects to a command and control (C2) server to download a stage two component.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** Adding registry keys and storing C2 information.
   - **Command and Control:** Connecting to a C2 server to download a stage two component.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the initial step in the sequence, where 'Surtr' ensures persistence by adding registry keys and storing C2 information. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurs after persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - This is the next logical step after ensuring persistence. After the malware has established persistence, it would connect to a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional components.
   - **Answer Choice C: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the immediate next step after ensuring persistence and before connecting to a C2 server.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. While it is also a common step, it is not the immediate next step after ensuring persistence and before connecting to a C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after ensuring persistence, the next step is to establish command and control.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
