### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions:
     - Executing CertUtil.exe disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe'.
     - Creating a .vbs script to download additional payloads.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to ensure the recurring execution of malicious payloads.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a system. This can include creating or modifying system processes to run malicious code repeatedly.
     - Creating a .vbs script to download additional payloads and ensuring it runs repeatedly aligns with the goal of persistence.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. While disguising CertUtil.exe as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' is a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about ensuring recurring execution.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a target network. This does not align with the goal of ensuring recurring execution of malicious payloads.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This does not align with the goal of ensuring recurring execution of malicious payloads.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question involves executing a disguised executable and creating a script to download additional payloads. The goal of ensuring that these payloads run repeatedly is a clear indication of persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with the tactic of ensuring recurring execution of malicious payloads.

**Final Answer: A: Persistence**
