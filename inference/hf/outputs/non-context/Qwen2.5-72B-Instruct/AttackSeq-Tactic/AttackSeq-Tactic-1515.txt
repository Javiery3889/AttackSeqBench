### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with spear-phishing emails containing a dropper.
   - The dropper is disguised as a document or image.
   - The goal is to establish persistence using tools like Termite for long-term access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with a dropper.
   - **Execution:** The dropper is executed when the user opens the document or image.
   - **Persistence:** Tools like Termite are deployed to maintain long-term access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as creating malicious documents or images. However, this occurs before the initial access and is not the next step after the dropper is executed.
   - **B: Persistence:** This is the final step mentioned in the question, where tools like Termite are deployed to maintain long-term access. It cannot be the step before persistence.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is not a step that occurs after the initial access and execution.
   - **D: Execution:** This is the step where the dropper is executed after the user opens the document or image. It logically follows the initial access and precedes the deployment of persistence tools.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:** The attack begins with spear-phishing emails containing a dropper.
2. **Execution:** When the user opens the document or image, the dropper is executed.
3. **Persistence:** After the dropper is executed, tools like Termite are deployed to establish long-term access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Execution
