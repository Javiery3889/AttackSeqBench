### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where a PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download resources.
   - After the download, GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are activated on the compromised system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Communication:** The PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers.
   - **Resource Download:** The script downloads resources from the C2 servers.
   - **Malware Activation:** GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are activated on the system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure. While the initial communication and resource download fall under this tactic, the question asks about what happens after the malware is activated.
   - **B: Exfiltration:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the compromised system and sending it to an external location. The question does not mention any data exfiltration.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gaining higher-level permissions on the compromised system. The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges.
   - **D: Impact:**
     - This tactic involves the attacker causing damage to the system, such as encrypting files (ransomware) or disrupting operations. GandCrab ransomware is known for encrypting files, which is a form of impact.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the activation of GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware, is the **Impact** tactic. GandCrab ransomware is designed to encrypt files, which is a clear form of impact on the system.

### Final Answer: D: Impact
