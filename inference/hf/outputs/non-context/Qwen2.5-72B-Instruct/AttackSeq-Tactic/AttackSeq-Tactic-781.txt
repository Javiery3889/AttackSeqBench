### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Implementing checks for security software to evade detection.
     - Interacting with a Mattermost server to collect system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** Implementing checks for security software to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** Interacting with a Mattermost server to collect system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Collection**
     - This is the tactic of gathering data from the system, which aligns with interacting with a Mattermost server to collect system information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Defense Evasion**
     - This is the tactic of avoiding detection, which aligns with implementing checks for security software.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This is the tactic of gaining initial entry into the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - This is the tactic of gathering information about the system, which could be a step before collection but is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Defense Evasion:** Implementing checks for security software.
     2. **Collection:** Interacting with a Mattermost server to collect system information.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred after Defense Evasion but before Collection.
   - The most plausible tactic that fits this sequence is **Discovery**. Discovery is often a step where attackers gather information about the system before collecting specific data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Discovery
