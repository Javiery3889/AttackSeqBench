### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has used credential-stealing modules targeting Windows Explorer and has monitored IIS network traffic to collect administration data.
   - The next step in the sequence is to locate processes and memory utilization across the infected system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - Credential stealing (e.g., targeting Windows Explorer).
     - Monitoring IIS network traffic to collect administration data.
   - **Next Action:**
     - Locating processes and memory utilization.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Collection:**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system. While this could be part of the overall attack, the specific action of locating processes and memory utilization is more about understanding the system rather than collecting data.
   - **B: Discovery:**
     - The Discovery tactic involves the attacker attempting to understand the system and network environment. This includes identifying processes, memory utilization, and other system details. This aligns well with the described action of locating processes and memory utilization.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:**
     - The Reconnaissance tactic involves gathering information before the initial compromise. This is typically done before the attack begins, not after gaining access and stealing credentials.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves gaining entry into the system. This is the first step in the attack, not the step of locating processes and memory utilization.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker is performing Discovery to locate processes and memory utilization.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
