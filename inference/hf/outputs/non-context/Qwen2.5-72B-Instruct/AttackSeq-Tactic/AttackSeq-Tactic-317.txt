### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the SysUpdate malware.
   - The launcher acts as an installer by copying and hiding files under a hardcoded directory and updating their file attributes.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** The launcher acts as an installer.
   - **Subsequent Actions:** 
     - Copying files.
     - Hiding files.
     - Updating file attributes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. The described actions (copying, hiding, and updating file attributes) do not directly relate to data collection.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Hiding files and updating file attributes are common techniques used to evade detection.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. While the launcher is part of the execution process, the described actions (copying, hiding, and updating file attributes) are more about maintaining the malware's presence and avoiding detection.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions. The described actions do not directly involve gaining higher privileges.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The launcher's actions of copying, hiding, and updating file attributes are primarily aimed at avoiding detection and maintaining the malware's presence on the system.
   - These actions align closely with the **Defense Evasion** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - While the launcher is part of the execution process, the specific actions described are more focused on evading defenses rather than executing the malware itself.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
