### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack where Geumseong121 used a website disguised as a fundraising service to deliver a malicious app to the victims.
   - The key point here is the delivery of the malicious app, which is a form of initial access to the victim's system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after delivering the malicious app.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. This could be a subsequent step after gaining initial access, but it is not the immediate next step.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain an initial foothold in a target network. The delivery of a malicious app via a disguised website is a clear example of initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is typically a preparatory step before the actual attack and not a step that follows the delivery of a malicious app.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the initial access was achieved through the delivery of the malicious app.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
