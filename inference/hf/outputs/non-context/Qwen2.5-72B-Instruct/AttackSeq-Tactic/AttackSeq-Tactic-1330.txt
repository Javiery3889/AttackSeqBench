### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through malicious apps on Google Play.
   - The next step in the sequence is achieving privilege escalation through device rooting and accessibility permissions.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the privilege escalation.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Gained through malicious apps on Google Play.
   - Privilege Escalation: Achieved through device rooting and accessibility permissions.
   - We need to find the tactic that logically fits between these two steps.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, not the step before it. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system, network, and environment. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before attempting privilege escalation. The attacker needs to understand the device's configuration and capabilities to effectively root the device and gain higher privileges.

   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs during the initial access phase when the malicious app is installed and run. It is not a step that logically fits between initial access and privilege escalation.

   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is important throughout the attack, it is not a necessary step that must occur before privilege escalation. The attacker might use defense evasion techniques during the initial access and privilege escalation phases, but it is not a prerequisite for privilege escalation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most logical step between gaining initial access and achieving privilege escalation is **Discovery**. The attacker needs to gather information about the device to effectively root it and gain higher privileges.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
