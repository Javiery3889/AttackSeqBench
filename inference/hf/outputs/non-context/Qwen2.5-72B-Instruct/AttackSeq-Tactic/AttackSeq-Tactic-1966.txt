### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR against a target in the chemical sector via spear-phishing delivery.
   - The key elements are:
     - Exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250).
     - Targeting a specific sector (chemical).
     - Delivery method (spear-phishing).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This is typically a later stage in an attack and not a prerequisite for exploiting a vulnerability.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This includes spear-phishing, which is mentioned in the question. However, the question specifically asks about what happened before the exploitation of the vulnerability.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - The Reconnaissance tactic involves gathering information to support planning for future operations. This is often the first step in an attack, where the adversary identifies potential targets, vulnerabilities, and methods of entry.
   - **D: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves techniques for gathering information from a target network. This is typically a later stage in an attack, after initial access has been gained.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question asks about what occurred before the exploitation of the vulnerability, the most logical step would be the reconnaissance phase. The adversary would need to gather information about the target, including identifying the use of WinRAR and the presence of the CVE-2018-20250 vulnerability, before attempting to exploit it.

### Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance
