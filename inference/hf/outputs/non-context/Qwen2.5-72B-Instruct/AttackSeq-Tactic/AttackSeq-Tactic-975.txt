### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the CosmicDuke malware.
   - The actions include using FTP and WebDav servers for malware updates and communicating with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Malware Updates via FTP and WebDav:** This indicates that the malware is capable of updating itself, which is a common tactic to maintain persistence and adapt to changes.
   - **Communication with Remote Servers via HTTP GET Requests:** This suggests that the malware is communicating with a command and control (C2) server to receive instructions or data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the theft and transfer of data from the victim's network to an external location. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions communication and updates, which are more aligned with maintaining control.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be part of the attack, the question does not provide evidence that this is the next step after the described communication.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers. The question describes actions that are already part of the attack, not the preparation phase.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. The use of HTTP GET requests to communicate with remote servers is a clear indication of C2 activity.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is Command and Control (C2).

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
