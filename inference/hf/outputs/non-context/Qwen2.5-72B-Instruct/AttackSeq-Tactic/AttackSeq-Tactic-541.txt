### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the NewPass agent has already established communication with the command-and-control (C2) server and is using a custom encryption algorithm for HTTP POST requests.
   - The key point is to determine what ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur next in the attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with the compromised system. However, the question states that the agent has already established communication with the C2 server, so this is not the next step.
   - **B: Exfiltration:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to steal and transfer data from the compromised system to an external location. This could be a plausible next step after establishing communication and using encryption for data transfer.
   - **C: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gain information about the compromised system and its environment. This is also a plausible next step, as the adversary might want to understand the system before deciding on further actions.
   - **D: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gather data of interest from the compromised system. This could be a step that occurs after discovery, but it is less likely to be the immediate next step after establishing communication and using encryption.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the agent has already established communication and is using encryption, the most logical next step would be to either discover more about the system or to exfiltrate data.
   - Between Discovery and Exfiltration, Exfiltration is more likely to be the immediate next step because the agent is already using HTTP POST requests, which are commonly used for data exfiltration.

### Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
