### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - APT10 achieved persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - After achieving persistence, APT10 deployed tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials using DLL load order hijacking.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence**: APT10 used scheduled tasks or Windows services to ensure malware remained active.
   - **Credential Access**: APT10 used tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While APT10 might use defense evasion techniques, the question specifically asks about the sequence between achieving persistence and stealing credentials.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. While privilege escalation is often a step in the attack chain, the question does not mention any specific techniques related to privilege escalation between achieving persistence and stealing credentials.
   - **C: Collection**: This tactic involves techniques to gather data from the target system. While collection is a common step, it is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **D: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques to steal credentials. The question explicitly mentions the use of tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10 first achieves persistence to ensure the malware remains active.
   - After achieving persistence, the next logical step in the attack sequence is to gain access to credentials, which is necessary for further actions like lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - The use of tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials is a clear indicator of the Credential Access tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Credential Access
