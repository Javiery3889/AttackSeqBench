### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by attackers using the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communicating with a C&C server.
     - Preparing intellectual property by copying it to archives on internal systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. This is typically seen in destructive attacks, such as wiping data or causing system failures. The question does not mention any destructive actions, so this is less likely.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - The Persistence tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems over an extended period. While maintaining access is important, the question focuses on the final stages of the attack, which is more about completing the attack rather than maintaining access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - The Exfiltration tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. Given that the attackers have already prepared the intellectual property by copying it to archives, the next logical step would be to exfiltrate this data from the network.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The question already mentions that the attackers have used the PoisonIvy backdoor to communicate with a C&C server, so this step has already been completed.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described, the most plausible next step after preparing the intellectual property by copying it to archives is to exfiltrate the data from the network.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
