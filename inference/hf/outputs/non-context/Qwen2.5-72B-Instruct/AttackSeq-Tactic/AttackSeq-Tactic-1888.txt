### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Emissary Trojan.
   - The actions include:
     - Implementing updates for evasion.
     - Altering configuration storage.
     - Recompiling PE headers.
     - Establishing communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the unauthorized transfer of data from a network. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs to establish communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the methods and channels used by an adversary to communicate with and control compromised systems. Establishing communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure is a key aspect of C2.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. While the actions of altering configuration storage and recompiling PE headers are part of defense evasion, the question is specifically asking about the next step, which is establishing communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This is typically an earlier step in the attack chain and does not align with the establishment of communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Emissary Trojan, after implementing updates for evasion, established communication with hardcoded IPs and domain-based infrastructure, which aligns with the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
