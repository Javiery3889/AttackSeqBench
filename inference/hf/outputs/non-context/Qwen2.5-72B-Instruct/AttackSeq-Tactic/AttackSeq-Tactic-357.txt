### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The sequence includes data collection using a custom storage file format.
   - The sequence also includes data exfiltration over the C2 channel.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data out of a network or system.
     - This is the final step in the sequence, occurring after data collection and before the data is actually moved out.
     - Therefore, Exfiltration cannot be the answer as it is the next step after the data is collected and stored.

   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack.
     - This typically occurs before the initial compromise and data collection.
     - Therefore, Reconnaissance is not a plausible answer as it would occur before data collection.

   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system.
     - This is necessary to execute further actions, such as data collection and exfiltration.
     - After data is collected and stored, the attacker would use C2 to manage the exfiltration process.
     - Therefore, Command and Control is a plausible answer as it fits between data collection and exfiltration.

   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on the compromised system.
     - This is often necessary to perform data collection and other post-compromise activities.
     - However, it typically occurs before data collection, not after.
     - Therefore, Privilege Escalation is not a plausible answer as it would occur before data collection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
