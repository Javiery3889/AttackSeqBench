### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first masquerade their backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection.
   - The next step in the sequence is targeting the contents of source code repositories within the compromised networks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Masquerading the backdoor connection as an SSL connection to avoid detection.
   - **Subsequent TTP:** Targeting the contents of source code repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. Masquerading a backdoor connection as an SSL connection is a form of defense evasion.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials to gain access to systems. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. While establishing a backdoor connection is related to command and control, the question specifically mentions masquerading the connection to avoid detection, which is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. Targeting the contents of source code repositories is a form of discovery, but it is the next step after the backdoor connection is established and masqueraded.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first use a technique to avoid detection by masquerading their backdoor connection as an SSL connection. This is a clear example of **Defense Evasion**.
   - After successfully evading detection, the attackers then move on to target the contents of source code repositories, which is a form of **Discovery**.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Defense Evasion** occurred before the attackers targeted the contents of source code repositories.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
