### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where malware adds a registry key to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` to establish persistence across reboots.
   - The key phrase here is "establish persistence across reboots."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The action of adding a registry key to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts is a clear example of the **Persistence** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the most direct and relevant answer. Adding a registry key to ensure the malware runs at startup is a classic persistence technique.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control channels, which is not directly related to the described action of adding a registry key for persistence.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers, which is not relevant to the described action.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Persistence
