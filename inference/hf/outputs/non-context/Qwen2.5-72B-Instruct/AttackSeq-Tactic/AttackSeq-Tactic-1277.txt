### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Shuckworm.
   - The sequence includes executing VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic likely occurred before using `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Executing VBS scripts and HTA files:** This is typically associated with the **Execution** tactic, as it involves running malicious code.
   - **Maintaining presence:** This is associated with the **Persistence** tactic, as it involves ensuring the attacker can maintain access to the system over time.
   - **Using `mshta.exe` to bypass application control solutions:** This is also part of the **Execution** tactic, as it involves running a specific tool to execute code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the system, which is typically the first step in an attack. However, the question implies that the attacker is already present and maintaining their presence, so this is less likely.
   - **Collection (B):** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not mentioned in the question. The focus is on maintaining presence and executing code, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is directly mentioned in the question (executing VBS scripts and HTA files, and using `mshta.exe`). However, the question asks what occurred before using `mshta.exe`, so this is not the most likely answer.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system, which is mentioned in the question (maintaining their presence). This is the most likely answer because it fits the sequence of actions described.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Persistence
