### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Roaming Tiger gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - After gaining initial access, the next step mentioned is ensuring persistence by writing registry keys to run malicious files on startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - **Persistence:** Writing registry keys to ensure the malicious files run on startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. It is typically performed after gaining access and establishing persistence, not between initial access and persistence.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. It is a logical step after gaining initial access through a spear-phishing email, as the malicious document would need to execute to establish further control.
   - **C: Persistence:** This is the tactic mentioned in the question as the next step after gaining initial access. It is not the answer because the question asks what occurred between initial access and persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is typically performed before initial access, not between initial access and persistence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing, the attackers would need to execute the malicious code to establish further control and then ensure persistence.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between initial access and persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
