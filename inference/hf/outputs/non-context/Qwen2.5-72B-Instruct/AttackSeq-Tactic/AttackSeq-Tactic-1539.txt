### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers have moved laterally across the infrastructure, targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - The next step in the sequence is the preparation of documents pertaining to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves lateral movement and then the preparation of documents for exfiltration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic likely occurred before the preparation of documents for exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement is the process of moving through a network to expand access and control. This is already mentioned in the question as a completed step.
   - **B: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from various sources within the network. This is a logical step before preparing documents for exfiltration, as the attackers need to collect the relevant information.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves maintaining control over the compromised systems. This is typically an earlier step in the attack lifecycle, often occurring before lateral movement.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions to access more resources. This is also typically an earlier step, often necessary before lateral movement.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the attackers have already moved laterally and are now preparing documents for exfiltration.
   - Before preparing documents for exfiltration, the attackers would need to collect the relevant information from the internal hosts and servers.
   - Therefore, the most logical step before preparing documents for exfiltration is the Collection of data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Collection
