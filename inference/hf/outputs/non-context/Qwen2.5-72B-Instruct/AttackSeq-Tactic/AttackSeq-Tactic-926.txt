### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Blind Eagle uses a PowerShell script to load a DLL into memory from an obfuscated and Base64 encoded string and begins execution of their malicious payloads.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this execution step.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The described TTPs involve:
     - Using a PowerShell script.
     - Loading a DLL into memory.
     - The DLL is obfuscated and Base64 encoded.
     - Execution of the malicious payload.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. This is typically a step that occurs after initial access and execution.
   - **B: Impact**
     - Impact involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the adversary has established a foothold and executed their payload.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. This is the first step in the attack lifecycle, before any execution or persistence.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. This is the step described in the question where the PowerShell script loads the DLL and executes the payload.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The question describes the execution of a malicious payload using a PowerShell script. For this to occur, the adversary must have already gained initial access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before the execution of the payload is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
