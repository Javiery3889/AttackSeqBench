### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Scanning a large number of IPs to identify vulnerable systems.
     2. Using spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents to infect targets.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or network denial of service. This does not fit the sequence described, as it would typically occur after gaining access and establishing a foothold.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - The Reconnaissance tactic involves gathering information to support future operations. Scanning IPs to identify vulnerable systems is a clear example of reconnaissance. However, this is already mentioned as the first action in the sequence.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as passwords or API keys. This could occur after identifying vulnerable systems but before using spear phishing to gain initial access.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques to gain a foothold in the target network, such as spear phishing. This fits the sequence described, as it occurs after identifying vulnerable systems and before using the identified vulnerabilities to gain access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that APT28 performed reconnaissance by scanning IPs to identify vulnerable systems, then used the information gathered to perform initial access via spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
