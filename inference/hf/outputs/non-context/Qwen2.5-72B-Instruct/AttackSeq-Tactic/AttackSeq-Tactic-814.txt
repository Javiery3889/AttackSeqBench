### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an APT group using a malicious DLL payload to establish a remote connection back to a server with a specific IP address and port.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Malicious DLL payload**: This suggests the initial compromise and execution of the payload.
     - **Remote connection**: This indicates the establishment of a communication channel back to the attacker's server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**: This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after establishing a remote connection.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems or accounts. Again, while this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after establishing a remote connection.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. Establishing a remote connection back to a server is a clear indication of C2, as it allows the attacker to send commands and receive data from the compromised system.
   - **D: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves stealing data from the compromised system. While this could be a later step, it is not the most immediate action after establishing a remote connection.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
