### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Lazarus group maintained communication with command and control (C2) servers through backdoor malware that executed remote commands during the FEIB heist.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Backdoor malware**: This is a type of malware that allows unauthorized access to a system.
     - **Remote commands**: The malware is used to execute commands sent from a remote location.
     - **Command and Control (C2)**: The malware communicates with C2 servers to receive instructions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials to gain access to systems. While this could be a part of the attack, it is not the next logical step after maintaining C2 communication.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This could be a final step in the attack, but it is not the immediate next step after maintaining C2 communication.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code on a system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs before or during the establishment of C2 communication, not after.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The question already states that the group maintained communication with C2 servers, so this is not the next step.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question describes the group maintaining communication with C2 servers and executing remote commands, the next logical step in the attack sequence would be to perform actions that have a direct impact on the target, such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or data destruction.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after maintaining C2 communication and executing remote commands is to achieve the **Impact**.

### Final Answer: B: Impact
