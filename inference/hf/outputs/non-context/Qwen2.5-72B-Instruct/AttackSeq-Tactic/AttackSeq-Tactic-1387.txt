### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the Lampion trojan.
   - The trojan first avoids detection using anti-debug and anti-VM techniques.
   - The next step involves enabling communication with a remote server to collect disk details and banking credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Anti-debug and anti-VM techniques are used to avoid detection. This falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Next Step:** The trojan needs to communicate with a remote server to exfiltrate data. This involves establishing a command and control (C2) channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. While persistence is important, it is not the immediate next step after avoiding detection.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. This aligns well with the need to establish communication with a remote server.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information they can use to plan future operations. While reconnaissance is important, it is not the immediate next step after avoiding detection.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While this is the initial step, it is not the next step in the sequence described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Step (Defense Evasion):**
   - The trojan uses anti-debug and anti-VM techniques to avoid detection. This is a clear example of the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

2. **Next Step (Command and Control):**
   - After avoiding detection, the trojan needs to communicate with a remote server to collect and exfiltrate data. This is a clear example of the **Command and Control** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
