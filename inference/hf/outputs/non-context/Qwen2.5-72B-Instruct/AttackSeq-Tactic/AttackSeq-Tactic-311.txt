### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access is established through email attachments containing malicious VBA macros.
   - The next step involves the Sednit's Delphi downloader sending gathered information to a C&C server using the command `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the delivery of email attachments containing malicious VBA macros.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macros are executed, leading to the installation of the Sednit's Delphi downloader.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The Delphi downloader sends gathered information to a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it typically occurs before initial access and is not the immediate next step after initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.
   - **Execution (C):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The VBA macros are executed to install the Delphi downloader, which aligns with the execution phase.
   - **Initial Access (D):** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the starting point of the attack sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access → Execution → Command and Control.
   - The step that occurs immediately after initial access and before the C2 communication is the execution of the VBA macros to install the Delphi downloader.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
