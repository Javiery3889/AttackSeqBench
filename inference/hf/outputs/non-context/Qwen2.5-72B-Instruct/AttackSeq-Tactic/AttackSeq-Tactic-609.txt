### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Armageddon Group.
   - The sequence involves:
     - **Remote Template Injection techniques using RTF and DOCX files** (initial access method).
     - **Using Telegram channels to communicate with compromised systems** (command and control).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - Remote Template Injection techniques using RTF and DOCX files are typically used to gain initial access to a system. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Using Telegram channels to communicate with compromised systems is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) phase. This typically occurs after the initial access has been established.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and tools before the attack. This is usually a pre-attack phase and does not fit between initial access and C2.
   - **Answer Choice D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion techniques are used to avoid detection and maintain persistence. While this can occur at various stages, it is not the most logical step between initial access and C2 in this context.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access** (Remote Template Injection techniques using RTF and DOCX files).
     2. **Command and Control** (Using Telegram channels to communicate with compromised systems).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
