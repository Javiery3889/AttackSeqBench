### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used a PowerShell script to deploy LightNeuron on compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - The next step in the sequence is that LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attackers gain access to the network, typically through methods like phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
   - **Execution:** The attackers use a PowerShell script to deploy LightNeuron on the compromised servers.
   - **Discovery:** LightNeuron then executes functions to discover system network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the most likely step immediately before discovering system network configurations.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. Given that LightNeuron is executing functions to discover system network configurations, this is the most logical step.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic occurs at the very beginning of the attack sequence, before the deployment of LightNeuron.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial step, it is not the immediate step before discovering system network configurations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Discovery tactic occurred before LightNeuron executed functions to discover system network configurations.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
