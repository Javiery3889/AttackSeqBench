### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the ProjectM actors gained initial access.
   - The initial access methods mentioned are spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or network denial of service. This typically occurs after the attacker has already gained access and established a foothold in the network.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - The Initial Access tactic involves techniques that attackers use to gain entry into a network. This includes spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, which are mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - The Privilege Escalation tactic involves techniques that allow an attacker to gain higher-level permissions. This typically occurs after the attacker has already gained initial access.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - The Resource Development tactic involves techniques that attackers use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This includes setting up infrastructure, creating accounts, and developing malware. This often occurs before the initial access phase to prepare for the attack.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the initial access. Since the initial access methods (spear-phishing and watering hole attacks) are already mentioned, the most plausible tactic that would have occurred before this is **Resource Development**. This is because the attackers would need to set up the necessary infrastructure and resources to carry out the spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

### Final Answer: D: Resource Development
