### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Arid Viper group and the Phenakite iOS surveillanceware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Arid Viper distributed the Phenakite iOS surveillanceware using a mobile configuration profile.
     - **Persistence:** The malware achieved persistence through a jailbreak using the Osiris jailbreak and Sock Port exploit.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where the malware achieves persistence. It cannot be the tactic that occurred between Initial Access and Persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the sequence, where the malware is initially distributed. It cannot be the tactic that occurred between Initial Access and Persistence.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary attempting to map the network, identify system configurations, and gather information about the environment. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the adversary stealing data and sending it to an external location. This is typically a later step in the attack lifecycle, often after persistence is established.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - **Initial Access:** Arid Viper distributes the Phenakite iOS surveillanceware using a mobile configuration profile.
   - **Discovery:** The malware then likely performs discovery to understand the environment and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities.
   - **Persistence:** Finally, the malware achieves persistence through a jailbreak using the Osiris jailbreak and Sock Port exploit.

   Given this sequence, the most plausible tactic that occurred between Initial Access and Persistence is Discovery.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
