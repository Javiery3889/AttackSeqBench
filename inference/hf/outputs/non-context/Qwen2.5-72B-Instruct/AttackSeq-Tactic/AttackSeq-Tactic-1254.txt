### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of activities in the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Reconnaissance activities** using campaign infrastructure to target companies globally.
     - **Exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services** to gain access to the networks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (B):** This is the initial phase where the attackers gather information about the target. The question already mentions that reconnaissance activities have been conducted.
   - **Resource Development (C):** This involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as setting up infrastructure, but it typically occurs before reconnaissance.
   - **Collection (D):** This involves gathering data from the target network, which would occur after gaining access.
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the phase where the attackers gain entry into the target network, which fits the description of exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Reconnaissance** (already conducted).
     2. **Initial Access** (gaining access by exploiting vulnerabilities).
     3. **Collection** (would occur after gaining access).

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
