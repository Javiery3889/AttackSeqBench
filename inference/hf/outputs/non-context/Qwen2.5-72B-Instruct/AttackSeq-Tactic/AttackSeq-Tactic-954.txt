### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SWEED threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document.
     - Employing techniques such as T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This is often a step taken after initial access to ensure the attacker can perform more actions.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. This is typically the first step after gaining initial access, but in this case, the initial access is already achieved through the exploit.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This is usually a pre-attack phase and does not fit well between the exploit and stealth techniques.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This fits well between the initial exploit and the stealth techniques like T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing).

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained through the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using a hidden object in an Excel document.
   - After gaining access, the attacker would likely want to ensure that their actions are not detected.
   - Techniques like T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) are used to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - Therefore, the most logical step between the initial exploit and the stealth techniques is Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
