### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the KiraV2 malware.
   - The sequence includes exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices, executing DDoS attacks, and distributing itself to other IoT devices.
   - The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices:** This is the initial step where the malware gains access to the target devices.
   - **Executing DDoS attacks:** This occurs after gaining access.
   - **Distributing itself to other IoT devices:** This is a form of lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While this is part of the attack, it is not the initial step of gaining access.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target system. This is typically done after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the attacker gaining the initial foothold on the target system. Exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices to gain access aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. This occurs after the initial access has been gained.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical and initial step in the sequence described is gaining access to the IoT devices by exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Therefore, the ATT&CK tactic that best fits this initial step is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
