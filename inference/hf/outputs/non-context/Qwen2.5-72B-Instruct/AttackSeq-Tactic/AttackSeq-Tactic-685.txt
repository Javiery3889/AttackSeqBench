### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving an Explosive Trojan.
   - The key events are:
     - The Trojan uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
     - The Trojan is then configured to use a USB infection option to spread across the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Keylogging:** This is a technique used to capture keystrokes, which can be used to steal sensitive information like passwords.
   - **USB Infection:** This is a method of spreading malware by infecting removable media (USB drives) to propagate across the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of many attacks, it is not the most likely step before configuring the Trojan to spread via USB.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. While persistence is important, it is not the most relevant step before spreading via USB.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. Configuring the Trojan to spread via USB is a form of lateral movement, as it aims to infect other systems in the network.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion is important, it is not the most relevant step before spreading via USB.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The keylogging capability is used to gain access to administrator passwords, which is a form of credential access.
   - Once the attacker has the administrator passwords, they can configure the Trojan to spread via USB.
   - Spreading via USB is a method of lateral movement, as it aims to infect other systems in the network.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before configuring the Trojan to spread via USB is **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
