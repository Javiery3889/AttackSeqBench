### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of a malicious macro, which then led to the multi-stage Lokibot infection chain.
   - The key elements are:
     - Malicious macro execution
     - Multi-stage Lokibot infection chain

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - The execution of a malicious macro is itself an execution tactic. However, the question is asking about what happened before the macro was executed.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) typically occurs after the initial compromise and involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. This is not likely to be the step before the macro execution.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves the methods used to gain the initial foothold in the target environment. This could include phishing emails, drive-by downloads, or other techniques that deliver the malicious macro to the victim.
   - **D: Impact**
     - Impact is the final stage of an attack, where the attacker achieves their goal, such as data exfiltration or system destruction. This is not relevant to the initial stages of the infection chain.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gains Initial Access to the system, likely through a phishing email or another method that delivers the malicious macro. Once the macro is executed, it triggers the multi-stage Lokibot infection chain.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
