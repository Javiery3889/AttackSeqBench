### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT Sidewinder.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing the FinalBot backdoor by renaming it to Srvstr.exe.
     - Using DLL sideloading with cmpbk32.dll to avoid detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems over extended periods.
     - Renaming a backdoor and using DLL sideloading can be part of persistence, but the question is asking for what happened between these two actions.
   - **B: Command and Control:**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network.
     - After executing the backdoor and before using DLL sideloading, the adversary would likely need to establish or maintain command and control to manage the backdoor.
   - **C: Execution:**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running code on a target system.
     - The backdoor has already been executed, so this tactic is not applicable between the two actions.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry to a network.
     - This tactic is not relevant after the backdoor has already been executed.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the backdoor is executed, the adversary would need to establish or maintain command and control to manage the backdoor before using DLL sideloading to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions is Command and Control.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
