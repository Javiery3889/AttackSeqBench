### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with a phishing email delivering a PowerPoint add-in document with a VBA macro.
   - The sequence ends with the malware using `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - We need to determine the ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The phishing email is used to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macro in the PowerPoint add-in document is executed, which is the next step after gaining initial access.
   - **Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and tools needed for the attack, which typically happens before the attack is launched.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the victim's network to gather information, which can happen after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the first step in the sequence, where the phishing email is used to gain access. It cannot be the tactic that occurs after the VBA macro is executed.
   - **Execution (B):** This is the step where the VBA macro is executed, which is the immediate next step after gaining initial access. It is a plausible candidate for the tactic that occurs after the initial access and before the use of `mshta.exe`.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves exploring the network, which can happen after the initial payload is executed. However, it is not necessarily the immediate next step after the VBA macro is executed.
   - **Resource Development (D):** This tactic involves preparing the attack infrastructure, which typically happens before the attack is launched, not after the initial access and execution.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Phishing email delivers the PowerPoint add-in document.
     2. **Execution:** The VBA macro in the document is executed.
     3. **Execution (continued):** The malware uses `mshta.exe` to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL.
   - The step that occurs between the initial access and the use of `mshta.exe` is the execution of the VBA macro.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
