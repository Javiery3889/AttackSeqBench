### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by PROMETHIUM's malware.
   - The malware searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files.
   - The compressed files are then encoded and chunked.
   - The final step mentioned is sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Document search and compression.
   - **Intermediate Step:** Encoding and chunking the archive.
   - **Final Step:** Sending the archive to a C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the initial stages of an attack, it does not fit the context of sending data to a C2 server.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands or exfiltrate data. While it is related to the C2 server, the specific action described is the exfiltration of data, not the establishment or maintenance of C2 communication.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's environment. This is not relevant to the step of sending data to a C2 server.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing and transferring data from the victim's network to the attacker's infrastructure. The described action of sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server is a clear example of exfiltration.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that the step of sending the encoded and chunked archive to a C2 server is part of the **Exfiltration** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Exfiltration**
