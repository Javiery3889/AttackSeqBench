### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the initial access method used by OceanLotus in Operation Cobalt Kitty: spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for the attack. It is a common first step where attackers collect data about the target, such as email addresses, organizational structure, and network details.
   - **Resource Development (B):** This tactic involves establishing resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating malicious documents, and preparing phishing emails. This is typically done after reconnaissance.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data from the target network, which occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic involves gathering information from the target network to aid in further actions, which also occurs after gaining initial access.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** Before sending spear-phishing emails, the attackers would need to gather information about the target to make the emails more convincing. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, and other relevant details.
   - **Resource Development (B):** While this is a necessary step, it typically follows reconnaissance. The attackers need to know who to target before they can develop the resources.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic is not relevant before initial access, as it involves gathering data from the target network.
   - **Discovery (D):** This tactic is also not relevant before initial access, as it involves exploring the target network to find valuable information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance
