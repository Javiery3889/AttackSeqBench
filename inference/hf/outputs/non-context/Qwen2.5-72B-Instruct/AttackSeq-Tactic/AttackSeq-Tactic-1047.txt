### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where ProjectM actors used spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks to deliver malicious payloads exploiting known vulnerabilities in RTF and Excel files.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Spear-phishing emails
     - Watering hole attacks
     - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in RTF and Excel files

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack chain where the attacker gains a foothold in the target network. This is typically achieved through techniques like spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
     - The question states that the actors used these methods to deliver malicious payloads, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution is the next step after gaining initial access, where the attacker runs the malicious code on the target system.
     - While this is a crucial step, it occurs after the initial access has been established.
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation occurs after the attacker has gained access and executed the payload. It involves increasing the attacker's privileges to gain higher-level access.
     - This step is not the immediate next step after delivering the payload.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security systems.
     - This is typically a step that occurs after the initial access and execution of the payload.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Initial Access tactic occurred first, followed by Execution.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the initial step in the attack chain.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
