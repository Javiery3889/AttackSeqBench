### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware gathers system information and communicates this information back to its operators.
   - The key phrase is "communicated these details back to its operators using specific C&C servers."

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware has already gathered system information, which aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.
   - The next step is the communication of this information back to the operators, which aligns with the **Command and Control (C&C)** tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it might be a part of a broader attack, it does not directly relate to the communication of gathered information.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves the communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. It is the most relevant to the described interaction where the malware sends information back to the operators.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves the malware gathering information about the system. While it is a necessary step, it is not the focus of the question, which is about the communication of the gathered information.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. It is not directly related to the communication of gathered information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
