### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved through malicious email attachments with Game of Thrones-themed lures.
   - The initial access was facilitated by embedded .LNK objects.
   - After gaining initial access, persistence was established using a PowerShell script stored in the Startup directory.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the persistence was established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious email attachment that exploits a Game of Thrones-themed lure.
   - **Execution:** The .LNK object is embedded in the email attachment, which, when clicked, executes the malicious payload.
   - **Persistence:** A PowerShell script is stored in the Startup directory to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the final step in the sequence, not the one that occurs before persistence.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, not the one that occurs before persistence.
   - **C: Execution:** This is the step where the .LNK object is executed, which is the step that occurs before persistence.
   - **D: Collection:** This is not mentioned in the sequence and is not relevant to the steps described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Execution** occurred before persistence was established.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
