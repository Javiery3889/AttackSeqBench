### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the BlueDelta campaign conducted reconnaissance activities.
   - The reconnaissance activities involved exploiting Roundcube webmail software to gather information and redirect emails to an actor-controlled address.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these reconnaissance activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial foothold in the target network. It often precedes reconnaissance because the attacker needs to gain access to the target environment to conduct further activities.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or compromise data integrity. It typically occurs after the attacker has already gained access and conducted reconnaissance.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target network. While it can occur after initial access, it is often part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This is the tactic described in the question. It involves gathering information to support planning future actions. It is not the tactic that occurs before itself.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that the attacker first gains initial access to the target environment (Initial Access) before conducting reconnaissance activities.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the reconnaissance activities is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: A: Initial Access
