### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where T9000 (a malware) has already captured system data and stolen information like Skype communications during the Collection phase.
   - The next step in the sequence involves sending the encrypted stolen data traffic over a specified port to a C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The malware has already collected data (T9000 captured system data and stole information like Skype communications).
   - **Next Step:** The data needs to be exfiltrated to a C2 server.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:** This is the phase where data is gathered, but the question states that this phase is already completed.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This phase involves gaining initial access to the target system, which is not relevant to the current sequence of exfiltrating data.
   - **C: Impact:** This phase involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data, which is not relevant to the current sequence of exfiltrating data.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This phase involves the communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. Exfiltrating data to a C2 server is a common action in this phase.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the Collection phase, the data is exfiltrated to a C2 server, which falls under the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
