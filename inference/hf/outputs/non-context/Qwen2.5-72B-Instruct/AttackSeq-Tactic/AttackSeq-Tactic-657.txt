### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages.
   - After harvesting credentials, the next step is to exploit vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into the victim networks.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Spear-phishing to harvest credentials via fake login pages.
   - **Final Step:** Exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to gain access and move deeper into the network.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and before moving laterally or performing other actions.
     - This does not fit well between harvesting credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to acquire credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to gain access to systems.
     - This fits well with the initial step of spear-phishing to harvest credentials.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed to support an attack, such as setting up command and control servers.
     - This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit well between harvesting credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control.
     - This typically occurs after gaining initial access and is not a step that fits between harvesting credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after harvesting credentials via spear-phishing, the next step is to use those credentials to gain access to the network, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Credential Access
