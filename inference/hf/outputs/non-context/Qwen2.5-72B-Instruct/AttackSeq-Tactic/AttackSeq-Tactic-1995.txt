### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers first harvested credentials using the Responder tool.
   - The next step in the sequence is the establishment of network share and system information enumeration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the enumeration step.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Step 1:** Harvesting credentials using Responder.
   - **Step 2:** Establishing network share and system information enumeration.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:**
     - Execution involves running malicious code or commands on a system. While this might be part of the initial compromise, it is not the most likely step immediately before enumeration.
   - **B: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is a logical step after obtaining credentials, as the attackers would need to understand the environment to effectively use the harvested credentials.
   - **C: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time. While this is a common tactic, it is not typically the immediate next step after harvesting credentials and before enumeration.
   - **D: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. This is the step where the Responder tool is used to harvest credentials, but it is not the step that occurs after credential harvesting and before enumeration.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after harvesting credentials (Credential Access), the attackers would perform Discovery to understand the network and system environment before establishing network shares and system information enumeration.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
