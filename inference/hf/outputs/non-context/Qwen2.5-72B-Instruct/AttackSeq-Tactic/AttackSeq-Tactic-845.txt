### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. **System Fingerprinting and Discovery** (for espionage purposes).
     2. **Communication with C&C servers** using a custom cryptographic protocol over HTTPS.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it doesn't specifically fit the context of the sequence described.
   - **B: Collection** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from a target. This is a plausible step after discovery, as the adversary would likely want to collect data before communicating it back to the C&C server.
   - **C: Discovery** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. The question already mentions that discovery has occurred, so this is not a valid choice for the step in between.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions. While this could be a step in the attack, it is not necessarily the most logical step between discovery and communication with C&C servers.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery, the next logical step would be to collect the data that has been discovered. This data would then be communicated back to the C&C server.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the discovery and communication with C&C servers is **Collection**.

### Final Answer: B: Collection
