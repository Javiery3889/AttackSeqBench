### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Russian-speaking cybercriminals.
   - The sequence includes using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and exploring financial systems.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Exploring financial systems of the targeted organization.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the initial action of gaining credentials or exploring systems.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access. This could be a subsequent action after gaining initial access and credentials, but it is not the most likely action before gaining credentials.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a logical step before using remote administration tools to gain credentials, as the attackers need to know what systems and credentials to target.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data from the target. This is typically a later stage in the attack, after the attackers have gained access and explored the systems.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attackers first performed Discovery to gather information about the target environment, which would help them identify the system administrators and the financial systems to target. After this, they used remote administration tools to gain the necessary credentials and explore the financial systems.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
