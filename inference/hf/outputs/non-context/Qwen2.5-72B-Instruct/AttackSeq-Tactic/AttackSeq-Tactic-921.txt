### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence by APT33 targeting companies in the oil product supply chain.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Initial Access:** Gained through spear phishing campaigns.
     - **Persistence:** Secured using botnets.
   - We need to determine what likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the final stage mentioned in the question, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the first stage mentioned in the question, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack, such as gathering information, developing malware, and setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand its structure and identify valuable targets. It typically occurs after gaining initial access and before securing persistence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - After gaining initial access through spear phishing, the next logical step for the attacker would be to explore the network to understand its layout and identify valuable targets. This is the Discovery stage.
   - Discovery is a crucial step before securing persistence, as it helps the attacker find the best places to establish a foothold and maintain long-term access.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
