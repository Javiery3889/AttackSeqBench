### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through spearphishing and watering hole attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker used PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers for Flash, Citrix Client, and Chrome.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access through spearphishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Next Step:** The attacker uses PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the network, systems, and users. While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, it is not the most immediate action described in the question.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on the victim's system. Using PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers is a form of execution.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, not the step that occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves the attacker moving from one system to another within the network. This is not described in the question as the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most immediate and logical next step after gaining initial access is to execute the downloaded malicious scripts. The use of PowerShell scripts to download poisoned installers is a clear example of the Execution tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
