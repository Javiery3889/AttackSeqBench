### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where Trickbot, after connecting to a Command and Control (C2) server to download and execute a payload, proceeds to delete files with specific extensions on removable and network drives and replaces them with a copy of the malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial entry point of the malware into the system, which is not the focus of the question.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This is the step where the malware connects to a C2 server to receive further instructions or download additional payloads.
   - **File Deletion and Replacement:** This is the action where Trickbot deletes specific files and replaces them with a copy of the malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic is about gaining the initial foothold in the system, which is not relevant to the file deletion and replacement action.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that affect the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of systems and data. Deleting files and replacing them with malware is a clear example of impacting the integrity and availability of the system.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic is about the communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. While it is a crucial step, it does not directly describe the file deletion and replacement action.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While deleting files and replacing them with malware can be a form of defense evasion, the primary focus here is on the impact of the action.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the **Impact** tactic, as it directly addresses the deletion and replacement of files, which affects the system's integrity and availability.

**Final Answer: B: Impact**
