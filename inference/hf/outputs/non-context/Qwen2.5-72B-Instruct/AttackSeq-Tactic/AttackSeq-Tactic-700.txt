### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where malware has already scanned for files and prepared data containing paths of files to be exfiltrated.
   - The next step in the sequence involves communication from the infected system to the attacker using ports 80 or 443.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Scanning for files and preparing data for exfiltration.
   - **Next Step:** Establishing communication with the attacker using common ports (80 or 443).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the victim's system. While the initial step of scanning for files and preparing data for exfiltration falls under Collection, the question is asking about the next step, which is communication.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. It is not directly related to the communication step described in the question.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. While it is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it typically occurs before the actual infection and communication.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It directly aligns with the communication step described in the question, where the malware is communicating with the attacker using ports 80 or 443.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Step (Collection):** The malware has already scanned for files and prepared data for exfiltration, which is part of the Collection tactic.
2. **Next Step (Command and Control):** The malware needs to communicate with the attacker to exfiltrate the data. Using common ports like 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) is a typical method for Command and Control communication to avoid detection by network security measures.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
