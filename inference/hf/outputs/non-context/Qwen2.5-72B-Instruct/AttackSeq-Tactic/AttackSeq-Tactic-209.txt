### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker first employs defense evasion techniques.
   - After defense evasion, the Bandook loader injects a malicious payload and establishes communication with the C2 server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** Defense Evasion (switching external templates, using digitally signed payloads)
   - **Next TTP:** Injection of a malicious payload and establishment of communication with the C2 server

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Defense Evasion**
     - This is the initial tactic mentioned in the question, not the next one.
   - **Answer Choice B: Command and Control**
     - Establishing communication with the C2 server is a key component of the Command and Control tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques to maintain access to the system over time, which is not directly mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target, which is typically done before the initial compromise, not after establishing communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves defense evasion followed by the injection of a malicious payload and the establishment of communication with the C2 server.
   - The establishment of communication with the C2 server is a clear indicator of the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
