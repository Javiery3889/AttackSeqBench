### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the adversary gains Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF linked to ENVYSCOUT.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the Initial Access to provide the necessary infrastructure for hosting delivery scripts and malware C2s.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Resource Development**: Setting up the necessary infrastructure.
     2. **Initial Access**: Gaining access through spear-phishing emails.
     3. **Execution**: Executing the payload (ENVYSCOUT).
     4. **Command and Control**: Establishing C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. It occurs after Initial Access and is not related to setting up infrastructure.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining access to the victim's system, which is the next step after setting up the infrastructure.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources and infrastructure, such as setting up servers, domains, and C2 infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for Initial Access.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system, which occurs after Initial Access and Execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before Initial Access to set up the necessary infrastructure.
   - **Resource Development** is the only tactic that fits this description, as it involves preparing the resources and infrastructure needed for the attack, including hosting delivery scripts and C2 servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Resource Development
