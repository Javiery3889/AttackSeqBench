### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor BlueDelta.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Collecting emails by automatically forwarding them to an attacker-controlled address.
     - Exfiltrating the victim's Roundcube session cookie and address book.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - The collection of emails by automatically forwarding them is already part of the initial action described. Therefore, this tactic cannot be the one that occurs after the initial collection.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. This could be a plausible step between collecting emails and exfiltrating the session cookie and address book, as the attacker might need to send commands to the compromised system to facilitate the exfiltration.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and collection, not between collection and exfiltration.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the final step in the sequence, where the attacker removes data from the victim's network. This is the action that occurs after the collection of the session cookie and address book.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence would be:
     1. Collection of emails by automatically forwarding them.
     2. Command and Control to maintain access and send commands to the compromised system.
     3. Exfiltration of the Roundcube session cookie and address book.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
