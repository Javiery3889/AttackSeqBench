### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Dexphot malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Loading executables into system processes via process hollowing.
     - Ensuring persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Process Hollowing:** This is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process, which is a form of **Defense Evasion**.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring that the malware remains active on the system even after a reboot or system restart. This is achieved through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This is the final step in the sequence, where the malware ensures it remains active on the system.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This is the step where the malware uses process hollowing to inject itself into a legitimate process, making it harder to detect.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This involves stealing credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Defense Evasion** (process hollowing).
     2. **Persistence** (using dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks).

### Final Answer:
The ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Dexphot loaded executables into system processes via process hollowing and before it ensured persistence through dual monitoring services and scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe` is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
