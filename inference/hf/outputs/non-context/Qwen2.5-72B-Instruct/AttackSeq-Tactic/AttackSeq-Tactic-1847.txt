### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor BlueDelta.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Discovery**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gather system and network information.
     - **Exfiltration**: Automating the exfiltration of the victim's Roundcube session cookie and database information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two activities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2)**:
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after initial access and before or during other activities like discovery and exfiltration.
     - However, the question implies that the discovery activities have already been completed, so C2 is less likely to be the next step.

   - **B: Collection**:
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. The discovery activities described (gathering system and network information) are a form of collection.
     - However, the question specifies that the discovery activities have already been completed, so the next logical step would be to use the collected information to further the attack.

   - **C: Resource Development**:
     - This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, such as developing or acquiring tools, establishing infrastructure, and creating accounts.
     - This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not a logical next step after discovery.

   - **D: Defense Evasion**:
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security tools and processes.
     - After gathering system and network information (discovery), the attacker might use this information to evade defenses before exfiltrating data. This is a logical next step.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after discovery and before exfiltration is **Defense Evasion**. The attacker would likely use the information gathered during discovery to avoid detection while preparing to exfiltrate the session cookie and database information.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
