### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker ensures persistence by downloading a second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - The next step in the sequence is the Rising Sun implant communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The attacker ensures that the malware remains on the system by placing a second-stage binary in the startup folder.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the sequence described.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. The communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests is a clear indication of C2.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the step where the second-stage binary is placed in the startup folder.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the compromised system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the most likely step immediately before C2 in this specific sequence.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Persistence (placing the second-stage binary in the startup folder) followed by Command and Control (communicating with control servers).
   - The most logical and immediate step before the implant communicates with the control servers is the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
