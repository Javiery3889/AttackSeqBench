### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers have already compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence involves using Metasploit for system reconnaissance and progressing through other networks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Compromised domain administrator passwords and gained access to all active domain accounts.
   - **Next Step:** Using Metasploit for system reconnaissance and progressing through other networks.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While this could be part of the attack, it doesn't specifically fit the sequence of gaining access and then using Metasploit for reconnaissance.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question states that the attackers have already compromised the domain administrator passwords, so this step has already occurred.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. Given that the attackers are using Metasploit for system reconnaissance and progressing through other networks, this fits well with the next logical step after gaining initial access.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the network. While this could be a later step, it doesn't fit the sequence of using Metasploit for reconnaissance and moving through the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining access to the domain administrator passwords and all active domain accounts, the attackers would use Metasploit for system reconnaissance and lateral movement to progress through other networks.

### Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
