### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking through the benign file `sidebar.exe` to evade antivirus detection.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - **DLL Hijacking**: A technique where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location that is searched by a legitimate program, causing the program to load and execute the malicious code.
     - **Evading Antivirus Detection**: The goal of using DLL hijacking is to avoid detection by security software.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial evasion technique.
   - **B: Discovery**: This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. Again, this could be a subsequent step but is not directly related to the initial evasion technique.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques used to avoid detection or analysis. DLL hijacking is a classic example of a defense evasion technique.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial evasion technique.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that the defense evasion tactic occurred after the DLL hijacking through `sidebar.exe` to evade antivirus detection.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
