### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Darkhotel APT.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - Employing digital certificates to sign their backdoors.
     - Encrypting gathered data in log files using similar algorithms to RC4.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors is a technique to evade detection and gain trust from the system.
   - Encrypting gathered data in log files is a technique to protect the data from being intercepted or analyzed.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. While encrypting data can be part of exfiltration, it is typically a later step in the attack sequence.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Using digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypting data are both methods of defense evasion.
   - **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs after initial access and before exfiltration.
   - **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves techniques to maintain long-term access to the system. While signing backdoors can help with persistence, it is more closely related to defense evasion.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypting gathered data are both techniques aimed at avoiding detection and analysis by security systems.
   - These actions are more aligned with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
