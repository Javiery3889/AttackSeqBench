### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before DNSpionage gained initial access via spear-phishing emails.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - DNSpionage gaining initial access via spear-phishing emails.
     - The emails contained malicious Microsoft Office documents disguised as job postings.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This could include identifying potential targets, understanding their roles, and gathering email addresses.
     - This is a logical step that would occur before sending spear-phishing emails, as the attackers need to know who to target and what type of content would be most convincing.

   - **Resource Development (B):**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as creating malicious documents, setting up command and control (C2) infrastructure, and developing the spear-phishing emails.
     - While this is also a necessary step, it typically follows reconnaissance and is more about the preparation of the attack rather than the initial targeting.

   - **Initial Access (C):**
     - Initial Access is the tactic that describes the methods used to gain a foothold in the target's network, such as spear-phishing.
     - The question already states that DNSpionage gained initial access via spear-phishing emails, so this is the tactic that is being described, not the one that occurred before it.

   - **Privilege Escalation (D):**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions within the target's network after initial access has been gained.
     - This tactic would occur after the initial access, not before it.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Reconnaissance** occurred before DNSpionage gained initial access via spear-phishing emails.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
