### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where TA505 initially gained access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely followed before they hijacked the RegIdleBackup scheduled task for maintaining persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - **Persistence:** Hijacking the RegIdleBackup scheduled task.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, it is not the most likely step before hijacking a scheduled task for persistence.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, not the step that follows gaining initial access.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is typically done before the initial access, not after.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely need to establish command and control to execute further actions, including hijacking a scheduled task for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was gained by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
   - After gaining access, the attacker would need to establish command and control to maintain communication with the compromised system.
   - Once command and control is established, the attacker can then proceed to hijack the RegIdleBackup scheduled task for persistence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
