### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication to evade detection and sends checksum-validated VictimSystemData in HTTP headers.
   - The next step in the sequence is establishing contact with the C2 (Command and Control) server via initial HTTP GET requests.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While the use of the WinInet API and checksum-validated data might help evade detection, the question is specifically about the next step, which is establishing contact with the C2 server.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Establishing contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests is a clear indication of C2 activity.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from a target network. The question does not mention any data collection activities.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves using the WinInet API to evade detection and send data in HTTP headers. The next logical step is to establish contact with the C2 server, which is a key part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - The other answer choices (Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, and Collection) do not align as closely with the specific action of establishing contact with the C2 server.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
