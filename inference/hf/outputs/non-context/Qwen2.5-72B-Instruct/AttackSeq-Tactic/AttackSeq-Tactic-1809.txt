### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where legitimate tools and scripts were used to avoid detection and remain undetected for six months.
   - The key points are:
     - Use of legitimate tools and scripts.
     - Avoiding detection.
     - Remaining undetected for a long period (six months).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary means to support an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or gathering information.
     - It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not related to maintaining persistence or avoiding detection.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves communicating with systems under the attacker's control to manage the attack.
     - While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it is not specifically about avoiding detection or maintaining persistence over a long period.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target environment.
     - Discovery is often an early stage in the attack lifecycle and is not focused on maintaining long-term persistence.
   - **D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker from the target environment.
     - Collection can occur at various stages of the attack, but it is not specifically about avoiding detection or maintaining persistence.

3. **Evaluate the Context:**
   - The use of legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection and remain undetected for six months suggests a focus on maintaining persistence and evading detection mechanisms.
   - The most relevant tactic in this context is **Command and Control (C2)**, as it involves maintaining control over the compromised systems and can include techniques to avoid detection and maintain long-term access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
