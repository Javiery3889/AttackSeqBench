### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FIN8.
   - The sequence includes the use of a malicious PowerShell command line via BADHATCH to download and execute a script for accessing networks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **BADHATCH**: This is a known malware used by FIN8 to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **PowerShell Command Line**: Used to download and execute a script.
   - **Accessing Networks**: The script is used to gain access to the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. This typically occurs before the actual attack.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to the target network. The use of a malicious PowerShell command to download and execute a script is a common method for initial access.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the actual execution of the attack.
   - **D: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. The use of a PowerShell command to download and execute a script is a form of execution.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the use of a malicious PowerShell command to download and execute a script, which is a clear example of the **Execution** tactic.
   - The script is then used to gain access to the network, which aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic, but the question specifically asks about what occurred after the PowerShell command was used.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Execution
