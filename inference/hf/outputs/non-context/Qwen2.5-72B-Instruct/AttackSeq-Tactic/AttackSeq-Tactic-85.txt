### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first exploits public-facing applications and uploads webshells to gain a foothold.
   - The next step in the sequence is the deployment of custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the deployment of the custom malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells.
   - **Execution:** Deploying custom malware like 'IPsec Helper' for command execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is the tactic that involves running malicious code, which aligns with the deployment of 'IPsec Helper' for command execution. However, this is the next step in the sequence, not the one before it.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing or acquiring tools. This is typically done before gaining initial access and is not the immediate step before deploying custom malware.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the target environment, which aligns with exploiting public-facing applications and uploading webshells. This is the first step in the sequence, not the one before deploying custom malware.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After gaining initial access and before deploying custom malware, the attacker would likely establish command and control to manage the compromised system and prepare for further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access, the attacker would establish command and control before deploying custom malware for command execution.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
