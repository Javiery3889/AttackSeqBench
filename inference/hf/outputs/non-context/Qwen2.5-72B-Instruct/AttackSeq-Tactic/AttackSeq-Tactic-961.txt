### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker initially gains access by masquerading as a member of Cambridge University and delivering malicious documents via LinkedIn.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the TONEDEAF malware communicated with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access by masquerading as a member of Cambridge University and delivering malicious documents via LinkedIn.
   - **Communication with C2 Server:** The TONEDEAF malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains access to the target system. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the communication with the C2 server, which is a step after initial access.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the attacker stealing data from the target system and sending it to an external location. This is typically a later stage in the attack and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. While this could be relevant, it is not the most immediate step before communication with the C2 server.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code on the target system. After gaining initial access, the attacker would need to execute the malware to establish communication with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker gains initial access, then executes the malware, and finally communicates with the C2 server.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the TONEDEAF malware communicated with the C2 server is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
