### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker has already employed defense evasion techniques, specifically self-deletion based on a hardcoded date.
   - The next step in the sequence involves gathering detailed information such as IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**:
     - The Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they are operating in. This includes gathering information about the system, network, and user details.
     - Gathering IP addresses, platform details, and directory listings aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**:
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While self-deletion is a defense evasion technique, the question is asking about the next step, which is gathering information.
   - **C: Persistence**:
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems over extended periods. Gathering detailed information is not a primary goal of persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**:
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future operations. While it is related to gathering information, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and not after defense evasion techniques have been employed.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context, is that after employing defense evasion techniques, the next step is to gather detailed information about the environment, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
