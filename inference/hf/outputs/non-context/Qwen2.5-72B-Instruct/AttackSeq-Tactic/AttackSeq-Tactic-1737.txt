### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Turla utilized a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor on the compromised Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - The key elements are:
     - Turla (a known threat actor)
     - PowerShell script
     - Installation of the LightNeuron backdoor
     - Compromised Microsoft Exchange servers

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that threat actors use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.
     - While Initial Access is a crucial first step, it typically occurs before the attacker has established a presence on the network and is not directly related to the installation of a backdoor.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that threat actors use to gain information about the network, systems, and users. This could include network scanning, system information discovery, and user enumeration.
     - Discovery is often a step that occurs after Initial Access but before the attacker is ready to install a backdoor. However, it is not the most immediate precursor to the installation of a backdoor.

   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that threat actors use to move through a network from one system to another. This could include using legitimate credentials, exploiting trust relationships, or using remote services.
     - Lateral Movement is a step that occurs after the attacker has gained initial access and has discovered the network. It is often a precursor to installing a backdoor on a specific target, such as a Microsoft Exchange server.

   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that threat actors use to run malicious code on a system. This could include using command-line interfaces, scripts, or other methods to execute payloads.
     - Execution is a critical step in the attack chain, and it is directly related to the installation of a backdoor. The use of a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor is an example of Execution.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sequence of events, the most plausible tactic that occurred before Turla utilized a PowerShell script to install the LightNeuron backdoor is **Execution**. The PowerShell script itself is a method of executing the backdoor installation.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
