### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where TG1021 initially gains access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - The next step in the sequence is achieving persistence by utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework operating in-memory.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and achieving persistence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. While this is a crucial step, it typically follows initial access and is often part of the process of achieving persistence. However, it is not the most likely step immediately after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain higher levels of access. While this can occur after initial access, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for achieving persistence.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. Reconnaissance can occur before initial access, but it is not typically a step that occurs immediately after gaining initial access and before achieving persistence.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic is already described in the question as the first step, so it cannot be the answer.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access → (Unknown Tactic) → Persistence.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker needs to execute their payload to establish a foothold and then achieve persistence.
   - The most logical step between gaining initial access and achieving persistence is **Execution**. This is because the attacker needs to run the web shells and custom malware framework to maintain control over the compromised system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Execution
