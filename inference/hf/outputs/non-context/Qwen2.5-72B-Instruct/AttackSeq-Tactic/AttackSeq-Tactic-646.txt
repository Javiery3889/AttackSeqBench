### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence mentioned is: delivering Gh0st RAT via email and then employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Delivering Gh0st RAT via email is a technique under the "Initial Access" tactic.
   - **Execution:** Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL is a technique under the "Execution" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic is already covered by the first step (delivering Gh0st RAT via email).
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not a likely candidate for the step between initial access and execution.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. DLL side-loading is a technique under the "Execution" tactic, so this is a strong candidate for the step between initial access and the final execution.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It typically occurs after initial access and execution, so it is not a likely candidate for the step between initial access and execution.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Delivering Gh0st RAT via email.
     2. **Execution:** Employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.
   - The step between these two is the actual execution of the malware, which is covered by the "Execution" tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
