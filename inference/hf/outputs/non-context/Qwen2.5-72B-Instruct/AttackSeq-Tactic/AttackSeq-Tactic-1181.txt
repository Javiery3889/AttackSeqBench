### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where APT28 identifies vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server after performing IP range scans.
   - The key actions are:
     - IP range scans
     - Reporting scanning results to a centralized server
     - Identifying vulnerable systems

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from a target system, which is typically done after gaining access to the system. This does not align with the initial scanning and identification of vulnerable systems.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is usually a step taken after identifying potential targets, not before.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to a target network or system. This is a step that would follow the identification of vulnerable systems, not precede it.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network, such as IP ranges, system configurations, and vulnerabilities. This aligns well with the described actions of performing IP range scans and identifying vulnerable systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that APT28 performed Discovery before identifying vulnerable systems by reporting scanning results to a centralized server.

**Final Answer: D: Discovery**
