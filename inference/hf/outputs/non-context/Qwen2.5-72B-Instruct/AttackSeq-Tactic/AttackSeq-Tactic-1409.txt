### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a supply chain attack where a trojanized version of 3CX software was distributed.
   - This trojanized software allowed the Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial infiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The trojanized 3CX software is distributed, which is the initial point of entry for the malware.
   - **Infiltration:** The Smooth Operator malware is now on the macOS systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker trying to understand the environment they have infiltrated, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. While this is a common next step, it is not the most immediate action after initial infiltration.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves the attacker attempting to obtain credentials to gain further access to systems and accounts. This is also a common next step but not the most immediate.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves the attacker running the malware on the target system. Given that the trojanized software has already been distributed and the malware is now on the system, the next logical step is to execute the malware.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic refers to the initial point of entry, which has already occurred with the distribution of the trojanized 3CX software.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most immediate and logical next step after the trojanized software has been distributed and the malware is on the system is to execute the malware.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Execution
