### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the execution of the lightSpy modular backdoor on an iOS device.
   - The attackers then silently patched Safari and exploited CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Execution of the lightSpy modular backdoor.
   - **Subsequent Actions:** Silent patching of Safari and exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 to maintain control and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While this might be a part of the overall attack, it does not align with the described actions of maintaining control and evading detection.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code. The initial execution of the lightSpy backdoor falls under this category, but the question is asking about the subsequent actions.
   - **C: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and maintain control over the compromised system. Silent patching and exploiting a vulnerability to maintain control are classic examples of defense evasion.
   - **D: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. The question does not mention any actions related to stealing or using credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial execution of the lightSpy backdoor is an example of the **Execution** tactic.
   - The subsequent actions of silently patching Safari and exploiting CVE-2019-8605 are aimed at maintaining control and evading detection, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the initial execution, which is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
