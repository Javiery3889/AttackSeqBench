### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the Fox Kitten Campaign has already engaged in lateral movement using tools like 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE'.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that would follow this lateral movement.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - Command and Control is typically established early in the attack lifecycle to maintain communication between the attacker and the compromised systems. While it is crucial, it is usually set up before or during the initial compromise and not typically a direct follow-up to lateral movement.
   - **B: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to access additional systems. This is often a precursor to lateral movement but can also occur after lateral movement to gain access to more systems or to maintain persistence.
   - **C: Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltration is the process of stealing data from the compromised systems and transferring it to the attacker's control. This is a common goal after gaining access to multiple systems through lateral movement.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system. This is often necessary before or during lateral movement to access more systems, but it can also occur after lateral movement to gain more control over the compromised systems.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that lateral movement has already occurred, the next logical step would be to either exfiltrate data or escalate privileges to gain more control. However, exfiltration is a more direct and common goal after gaining access to multiple systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after lateral movement is exfiltration.

### Final Answer: C: Exfiltration
