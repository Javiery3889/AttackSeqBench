### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack.
   - The sequence mentioned is:
     1. Employing AES128-CBC and RC4 encryption to evade defenses.
     2. Monitoring MsBuild.exe processes to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build.

2. **Identify the TTPs:**
   - **Employing AES128-CBC and RC4 encryption to evade defenses:** This is a technique under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Monitoring MsBuild.exe processes to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build:** This is a technique under the **Discovery** tactic, as the attacker is trying to understand the environment and identify specific processes or files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration (A):** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data out of the network. It typically occurs after the attacker has already gained access, discovered valuable data, and is ready to remove it. This does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Discovery (B):** This tactic involves the attacker gaining information about the environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and running processes. Monitoring MsBuild.exe processes to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build fits this tactic.
   - **Collection (C):** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker, such as documents, emails, or other files. While this could be a subsequent step, it does not fit the specific action of monitoring processes.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. The use of encryption to evade defenses fits this tactic, but the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this step.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described is:
     1. **Defense Evasion** (using encryption to evade defenses).
     2. **Discovery** (monitoring MsBuild.exe processes to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build).
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two steps is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
