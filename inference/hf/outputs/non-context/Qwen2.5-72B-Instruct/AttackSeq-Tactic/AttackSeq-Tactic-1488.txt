### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Iranian threat actors established fake personas and a fictitious news organization to support their reconnaissance activities on social media.
   - The key elements here are the use of fake personas and a fictitious news organization, which are part of the reconnaissance phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial phase described is **Reconnaissance**.
   - The question asks what ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the reconnaissance activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the target system or network. While this could occur after reconnaissance, it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **B: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating tools. This could be a plausible next step after reconnaissance.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This is the initial phase already described in the question, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by the target's defenses. This is typically a later phase in the attack lifecycle, not immediately after reconnaissance.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The most plausible next step after establishing fake personas and a fictitious news organization for reconnaissance is to develop the necessary resources to support the attack. This aligns with the **Resource Development** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Resource Development
