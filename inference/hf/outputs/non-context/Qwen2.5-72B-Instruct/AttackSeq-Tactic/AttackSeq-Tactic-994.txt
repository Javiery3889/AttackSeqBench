### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events starting with a spear-phishing attack that exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) in Adobe Flash.
   - The goal is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing attack is the initial point of entry.
   - **Exploitation of Vulnerability:** The attack exploits the Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119).
   - **Delivery of Secondary Payload:** The exploit delivers a secondary payload.
   - **Execution of ActionScript Classes:** The ActionScript classes are executed to install the payload.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as creating malicious documents or setting up infrastructure. It typically occurs before the initial access but is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. It is usually a post-compromise activity and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code on the victim's system. The execution of the ActionScript classes to install the payload is part of this tactic, but the question asks what happens before this execution.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining entry into the victim's system. The spear-phishing attack is the initial access method, and it is the first step in the sequence described.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of events is: Initial Access (spear-phishing) → Exploitation of Vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) → Delivery of Secondary Payload → Execution of ActionScript Classes.
   - The tactic that most likely occurred before the execution of the ActionScript classes is the initial access via the spear-phishing attack.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
