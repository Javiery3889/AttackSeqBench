### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the FAKEM RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
   - The sequence includes:
     - Gaining persistence by copying itself to the %System% folder.
     - Adding a registry entry for execution at startup.
     - Disguising its network traffic to resemble protocols like Windows Messenger.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not directly related to the described actions.
   - **B: Discovery** - This tactic involves gathering information about the system and network, which is also not directly related to the described actions.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial entry into the system, which has already occurred before the described actions.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Disguising network traffic to resemble legitimate protocols is a common defense evasion technique.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The action of disguising network traffic to resemble legitimate protocols like Windows Messenger is a clear example of **Defense Evasion**. This is because it helps the malware avoid detection by security systems that might otherwise flag the traffic as suspicious.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
