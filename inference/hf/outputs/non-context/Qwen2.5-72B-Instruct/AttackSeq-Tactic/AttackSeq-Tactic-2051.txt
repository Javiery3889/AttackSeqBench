### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has already collected information from an iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves sending this data out via HTTP and receiving commands from the attacker.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Data Collection:** The attacker has already collected sensitive information from the device.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The collected data is being sent out via HTTP.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The attacker is receiving commands from a remote server to control the compromised device.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is not relevant to the scenario where data is being exfiltrated and commands are being received.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised device and receiving commands from a remote server. This aligns with the scenario where data is being exfiltrated and commands are being received.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. It is not relevant to the scenario where data is being exfiltrated and commands are being received.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network and system to find valuable information. It is not relevant to the scenario where data is being exfiltrated and commands are being received.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
