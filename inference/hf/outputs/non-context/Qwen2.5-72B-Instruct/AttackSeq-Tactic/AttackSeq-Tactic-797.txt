### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver the XtremeRat backdoor trojan to Israeli and Palestinian targets.
   - The focus is on the initial step of the attack sequence, which involves delivering the malicious payload.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target's network. It is not relevant to the initial delivery of the payload.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it is not the step described in the question.
   - **C: Initial Access** - This tactic involves the methods used to gain a foothold in the target's network. Spear phishing with malicious attachments is a common technique under Initial Access.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves the actual execution of the malicious payload on the target's system. While this is part of the attack sequence, it is not the initial step described in the question.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the delivery of spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, which falls under the **Initial Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
