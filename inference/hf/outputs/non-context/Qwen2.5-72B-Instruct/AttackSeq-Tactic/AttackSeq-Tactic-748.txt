### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Obfuscation and registry modifications to deactivate security mechanisms related to macros.
     - Backdoors automatically listing interesting files for future exfiltration.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation and Registry Modifications to Deactivate Security Mechanisms:**
     - This is a clear example of **Defense Evasion**. The attackers are trying to avoid detection and prevent security mechanisms from functioning.
   - **Backdoors Automatically Listing Interesting Files:**
     - This step involves identifying and cataloging files of interest, which is a form of **Discovery**. The attackers are gathering information about the system to determine what files are valuable for exfiltration.

3. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - This fits the step where the backdoors list interesting files. However, this is not the first step in the sequence.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the described sequence.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This fits the step where the attackers deactivate security mechanisms. This is the first step in the sequence.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. It does not fit the described sequence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Step: Defense Evasion**
   - The attackers use obfuscation and registry modifications to deactivate security mechanisms related to macros. This is a clear example of **Defense Evasion**.
2. **Subsequent Step: Discovery**
   - After deactivating security mechanisms, the backdoors list interesting files for future exfiltration. This is a form of **Discovery**.

### Final Answer:
The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that **Defense Evasion** occurred before the backdoors listed interesting files for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
