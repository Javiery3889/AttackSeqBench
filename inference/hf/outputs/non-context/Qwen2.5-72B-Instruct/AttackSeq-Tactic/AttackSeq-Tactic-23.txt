### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor UNC1945.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Conducting internal reconnaissance using network scanners and other tools.
     - Using ProxyChains and stolen credentials.
     - Downloading PUPYRAT (a remote access trojan).
     - Moving via RDP to a Windows server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary's efforts to gain information about the network, systems, and users. This aligns with the initial step of conducting internal reconnaissance using network scanners and other tools.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves the adversary's efforts to move through the network to access additional systems. This aligns with the use of ProxyChains, stolen credentials, and RDP to move to a Windows server.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves the adversary's efforts to establish resources for use in later stages of the attack. This does not align well with the described sequence, which focuses on reconnaissance and movement.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the adversary's efforts to steal data from the network. This does not align with the described sequence, which focuses on reconnaissance and movement.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with internal reconnaissance, which is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
   - After gaining information, the threat actor uses ProxyChains and stolen credentials to move laterally through the network, which is a clear example of the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - The use of PUPYRAT and RDP to move to a Windows server further confirms the Lateral Movement tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic was followed by the Lateral Movement tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
