### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the MoonBounce implant has already established persistence by residing on the SPI flash.
   - The next step in the sequence is that the attackers ensured the malware operated in-memory only with a stealthy small footprint.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** The implant has already established persistence by residing on the SPI flash.
   - **Next Step:** The malware operates in-memory only with a stealthy small footprint.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic is already covered in the first part of the sequence where the implant resides on the SPI flash.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, which is not relevant to the in-memory operation of the malware.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Operating in-memory only with a small footprint is a common technique to evade detection by security tools and analysts.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the malware is designed to operate in a way that avoids detection, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
