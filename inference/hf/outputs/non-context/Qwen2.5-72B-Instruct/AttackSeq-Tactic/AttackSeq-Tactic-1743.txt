### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the attackers have already conducted Command and Control (C&C) by hiding C&C data using steganography in PDF or JPG files.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable the attackers to transfer the stolen data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not related to transferring stolen data.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is relevant to the use of steganography to hide C&C data, it does not directly address the transfer of stolen data.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques to steal and transfer data from the victim's network to the attacker's control. This is the most relevant tactic for the transfer of stolen data.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. While it is relevant to the initial C&C communication, it does not directly address the transfer of stolen data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of transferring stolen data after establishing C&C, is Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
