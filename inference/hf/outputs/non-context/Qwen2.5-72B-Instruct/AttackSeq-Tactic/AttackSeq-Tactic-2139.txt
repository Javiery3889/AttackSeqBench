### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT15.
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - APT15 then exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Final Action:** Exported data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.
   - **Intermediate Tactic:** We need to identify what logically fits between these two actions.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials. However, the question states that APT15 has already gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, so this tactic has already been completed.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target. While reconnaissance can occur at various stages, it is typically done before gaining credentials to understand the target environment. It is less likely to be the immediate next step after gaining credentials.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection. While defense evasion can occur at various stages, it is not the most logical next step after gaining credentials and before data exfiltration.
   - **D: Collection**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data of interest to their goal. After gaining domain administrator credentials, the next logical step would be to collect the data they are interested in, such as exporting data from Microsoft Active Directory and SQL databases.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 would then collect the data they are interested in before exporting it.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
