### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by APT28.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Installing key components to the disk using a second stage dropper.
     2. Using a tool for exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability to execute files with elevated permissions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first action is the installation of key components.
   - The second action is exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system.
     - It aligns with the second action described in the question, where APT28 uses a tool to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice B: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over an extended period.
     - While persistence is a common tactic, it is not necessarily the next logical step after installing key components and before exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
     - While defense evasion is important, it is not the most immediate next step after installing key components and before exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target.
     - Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial compromise and installation of components, not after.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. Install key components to the disk.
     2. Exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability to gain higher-level permissions.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two actions is **Privilege Escalation**.

### Final Answer: A: Privilege Escalation
