### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where an attacker exploits CVE-2017-11882 to achieve silent code execution upon opening a crafted Excel document.
   - After gaining code execution, the attacker proceeds to dump credentials from various registry keys using techniques like T1003 (OS Credential Dumping) and T1214 (Targeted Credential Dumping).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access to the system by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through a crafted Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The exploit leads to silent code execution.
   - **Credential Access:** The attacker then dumps credentials from various registry keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence where the attacker gains initial access to the system. However, the question is asking about the tactic that occurred before credential dumping, which is not the initial access.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing or acquiring tools. It is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from the system, which aligns with the described action of dumping credentials from registry keys using T1003 and T1214.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it might be relevant in the broader context of the attack, it does not directly describe the action of credential dumping.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence starts with the initial access via the CVE-2017-11882 exploit.
   - After gaining code execution, the next logical step is to perform credential access to obtain credentials from the system.
   - The techniques T1003 and T1214 are specifically used for credential access, making this the most relevant tactic in the sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
