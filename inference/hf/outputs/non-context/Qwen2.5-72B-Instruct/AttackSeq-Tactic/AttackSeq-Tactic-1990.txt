### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that starts with reconnaissance through spear-phishing emails.
   - The attackers then use macros in malicious Word documents to execute ThreatNeedle malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather information about the target (defense industry departments) and craft spear-phishing emails with personal information.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers use the spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to the target's systems via macros in malicious Word documents.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker exploring the network to understand the environment. It typically occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This is the initial phase where the attacker gathers information about the target. The question already states that reconnaissance has been conducted.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. It typically occurs after initial access and discovery.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This is the phase where the attacker gains the first foothold in the target's environment. The question describes the use of spear-phishing emails with macros to execute malware, which is a common method for initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Reconnaissance → Initial Access → Execution of ThreatNeedle malware.
   - The most logical step before executing the malware via macros in malicious Word documents is gaining initial access to the target's systems.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
