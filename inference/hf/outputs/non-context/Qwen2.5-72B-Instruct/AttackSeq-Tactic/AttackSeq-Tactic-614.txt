### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the WinDealer malware.
   - Key actions include:
     - Discovering network configurations.
     - Staging stolen data encrypted with AES under the %TEMP% directory.
     - Processing and classifying the gathered information into ".a" files.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system. This could include stealing files, scraping data from memory, or exfiltrating information.
     - The question mentions "staging stolen data," which aligns with the Collection tactic.
   - **B: Execution**
     - The Execution tactic involves running malicious code on the system. This could include launching a payload, running scripts, or executing commands.
     - The question does not specifically mention running new code or commands, so this is less likely.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves gathering information about the system and network. This could include network scanning, system information discovery, or identifying running processes.
     - The question mentions "discovering network configurations," which aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **D: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves manipulating or destroying data to achieve the attacker's goals. This could include data destruction, denial of service, or data corruption.
     - The question does not mention any destructive actions, so this is less likely.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions "processing and classifying the gathered information into '.a' files." This step involves organizing and preparing the data for exfiltration, which is a key part of the Collection tactic.
   - While Discovery is also mentioned, the final step of processing and classifying the data is more closely aligned with Collection.

### Final Answer: A: Collection
