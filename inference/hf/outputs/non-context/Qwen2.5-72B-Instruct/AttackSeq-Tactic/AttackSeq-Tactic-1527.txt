### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the RIG Exploit Kit (EK) and the use of malvertising or compromised websites to execute exploits.
   - It also mentions the use of proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The RIG EK redirects users through malvertising or compromised websites.
   - **Unknown Tactic:** The tactic we need to identify.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. It typically occurs after initial access and execution, but before or during defense evasion. However, it is not the most immediate next step after initial access.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already described in the question as the initial redirection through malvertising or compromised websites. It cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. It logically follows initial access and precedes defense evasion, as the exploit kit needs to execute the payload before attempting to avoid detection.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to spread the attack. It typically occurs after initial access, execution, and sometimes privilege escalation, but it is not the immediate next step after initial access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** RIG EK redirects users through malvertising or compromised websites.
     2. **Execution:** The exploit kit executes the malicious payload.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** The attacker uses proxy servers and antivirus testing to avoid detection.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
