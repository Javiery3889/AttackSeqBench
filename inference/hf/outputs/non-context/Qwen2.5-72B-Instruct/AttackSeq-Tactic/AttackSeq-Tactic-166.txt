### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has already installed backdoors on financial institution systems and is about to connect to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to avoid detection during this phase.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Installing backdoors.
     2. Avoiding detection.
     3. Connecting to C2 servers.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion tactics are used to avoid detection and analysis. This includes techniques like obfuscating code, using encrypted channels, and modifying system configurations to hide the presence of malware.
     - This aligns well with the need to avoid detection before connecting to C2 servers.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution tactics involve running malicious code on a target system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs earlier in the sequence, such as when the backdoor is initially installed.
     - This does not fit the context of avoiding detection before connecting to C2 servers.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement tactics are used to move through a network to access additional systems. This is typically done after gaining initial access and is not directly related to avoiding detection before connecting to C2 servers.
     - This does not fit the context of the question.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection tactics involve gathering data from the target system. This is typically done after gaining access and establishing a foothold, and is not directly related to avoiding detection before connecting to C2 servers.
     - This does not fit the context of the question.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs involves the attacker using Defense Evasion tactics to avoid detection before connecting to C2 servers.

### Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
