### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial access method used by APT28: spear-phishing campaigns containing malicious URLs or exploit documents.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that follows this initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it typically occurs before initial access, not after.
   - **Defense Evasion (B):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. After gaining initial access, an attacker would likely want to evade defenses to maintain persistence and continue their operations.
   - **Impact (C):** This tactic involves techniques that disrupt or destroy systems and data. Impact is usually a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after the attacker has achieved their objectives and is ready to cause damage.
   - **Execution (D):** This tactic involves running malicious code. While execution is a critical step, it often occurs during the initial access phase, not necessarily after.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial access was achieved through spear-phishing, the next logical step would be to evade defenses to ensure the attacker can maintain access and continue their operations without being detected.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after gaining initial access is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
