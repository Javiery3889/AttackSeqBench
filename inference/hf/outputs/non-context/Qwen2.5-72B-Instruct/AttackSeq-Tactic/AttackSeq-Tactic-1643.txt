### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before SideCopy gained initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs.
   - The key elements are:
     - Initial access through malicious LNK files.
     - Infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement is typically used after gaining initial access to move through the network. It is not a prerequisite for initial access.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to gain or maintain access. While it can be part of the initial access process, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for using malicious LNK files.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and tools for an attack. This can include creating malicious files, setting up command and control servers, and other preparatory activities. This is a logical step before gaining initial access.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This is often the first step in the attack lifecycle, as it helps the attacker understand the target's environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the sequence described, the most logical step before gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain would be to gather information about the target. This aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic.
   - Reconnaissance helps the attacker understand the target's environment, which is crucial for creating and deploying effective malicious LNK files and other components of the infection chain.

### Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
