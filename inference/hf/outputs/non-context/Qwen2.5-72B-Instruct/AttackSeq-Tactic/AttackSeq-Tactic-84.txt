### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question mentions that DYMALLOY and ALLANITE conducted surveys and took screenshots via malware and system tools during the Collection phase.
   - The key activities are: conducting surveys and taking screenshots.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The activities described (conducting surveys and taking screenshots) are part of the Collection phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred as a result of these activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This is the phase where the activities (conducting surveys and taking screenshots) are taking place. However, the question asks for the result of these activities, not the phase they are in.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. Conducting surveys and taking screenshots do not directly lead to persistence.
   - **C: Impact** - This tactic involves degrading or disrupting the availability of systems or data. Conducting surveys and taking screenshots do not directly lead to impact.
   - **D: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for future operations. The information collected (surveys and screenshots) can be used to gather more detailed information about the target, which aligns with the goal of reconnaissance.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the activities described is that the information collected (surveys and screenshots) would be used for further reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
