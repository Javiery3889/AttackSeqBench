### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat actor FIN8.
   - The sequence includes ensuring persistence using the WMI event subscription mechanism and then executing credential dumping via a script named `mimi.ps1`.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence via WMI Event Subscription:** This is a technique used to maintain access to a system by creating a WMI event subscription that triggers a specific action, such as running a malicious script or executable.
   - **Credential Dumping via `mimi.ps1`:** This is a technique used to extract credentials from the system, often using tools like Mimikatz.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to a system. It typically occurs before persistence and credential dumping. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the tactic that occurred between persistence and credential dumping.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion can occur at various stages of an attack, it is not the most likely tactic to occur specifically between persistence and credential dumping.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from a system. Credential dumping is a direct example of this tactic. Since the question mentions executing credential dumping via `mimi.ps1`, this is the most likely tactic to occur after ensuring persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to support planning future attacks. Reconnaissance typically occurs before gaining initial access and is not likely to occur between persistence and credential dumping.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that FIN8 ensured persistence using the WMI event subscription mechanism, then performed credential access by executing the `mimi.ps1` script to dump credentials.

### Final Answer: C: Credential Access
