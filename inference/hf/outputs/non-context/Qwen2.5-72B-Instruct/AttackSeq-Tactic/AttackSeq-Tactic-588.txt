### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the context of Operation Aurora.
   - The sequence involves exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute a malicious payload.
   - After the execution, the attackers evaded detection by masquerading their backdoor connections as SSL connections.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
   - **Execution:** Executing the malicious payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Masquerading backdoor connections as SSL connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This typically occurs after the attackers have established a presence and have data to steal. It does not fit well between the execution of the payload and the evasion of detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attackers gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is a common step after gaining initial access and before executing further actions. However, it does not fit well between the execution of the payload and the evasion of detection.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack chain, where the attackers gain entry into the network. This has already occurred in the sequence described (exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer).
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious payload. This fits well between the initial access and the evasion of detection. After gaining access and executing the payload, the attackers would then need to evade detection to maintain their presence and continue their operations.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers executed the malicious payload after gaining initial access and before evading detection.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
