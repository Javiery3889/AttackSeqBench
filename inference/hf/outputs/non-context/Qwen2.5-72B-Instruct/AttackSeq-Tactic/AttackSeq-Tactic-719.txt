### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker acquires system details using various methods (WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls) and then overwrites data on hard drives using a specific plugin ('dstr.dll').
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Stage:** Acquiring system details using 'bs.dll' plugin, WMI client application, CPUID, and win32 API calls.
   - **Final Stage:** Overwriting data on hard drives using 'dstr.dll' plugin.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurs between acquiring system details and overwriting data. Execution is more likely to be part of the initial stage.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the system and network. The initial stage of acquiring system details using WMI, CPUID, and win32 API calls is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this is a common tactic, it is not the primary focus between acquiring system details and overwriting data.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems. The question does not mention any network traversal or accessing other systems, so this is not the most likely tactic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial stage of acquiring system details using WMI, CPUID, and win32 API calls is clearly a Discovery tactic.
   - The final stage of overwriting data on hard drives is a form of Impact, but the question asks about the tactic that occurs between these two stages.
   - Since the question does not mention any execution, defense evasion, or lateral movement between these stages, the most plausible tactic is Discovery.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
