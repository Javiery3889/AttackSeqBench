### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the Regin malware.
   - Key points:
     - Regin executed multi-faceted modules (loaders and orchestrators).
     - These modules performed tasks while actively avoiding detection.
     - The final step involves cleaning traces of its presence and blending in with the system’s memory pools.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves communicating with the attacker’s infrastructure to receive commands or exfiltrate data.
     - It does not align with the described action of cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools.
   - **B: Execution:**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim’s system.
     - While Regin does execute modules, the question is specifically about the final step of cleaning traces and blending in.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis.
     - Cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools are typical defense evasion techniques.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to spread to other systems.
     - It does not align with the described action of cleaning traces and blending in with the system’s memory pools.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Regin executes modules to perform tasks while avoiding detection.
   - The final step involves cleaning traces of its presence and blending in with the system’s memory pools.
   - This final step is a clear example of defense evasion, as it aims to avoid detection and maintain a low profile on the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is the one that aligns with defense evasion.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
