### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker uses impersonated login pages to collect credentials from targeted personnel.
   - After collecting the credentials, the attacker redirects the victim to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Impersonated login pages are used to collect credentials.
   - **Subsequent Step:** The victim is redirected to a YouTube clip via a suspicious link.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - Command and Control involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to control it.
     - This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, after initial access and possibly after establishing a foothold.
     - It is unlikely to occur immediately after credential collection and before the redirection to a YouTube clip.

   - **B: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle, often occurring before the attacker attempts to collect credentials.
     - It is not likely to occur after the credentials have been collected and before the redirection to a YouTube clip.

   - **C: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves the attacker attempting to collect credentials from the target.
     - This aligns with the initial step described in the question, where the attacker uses impersonated login pages to collect credentials.
     - This is the most plausible tactic to occur before the redirection to a YouTube clip.

   - **D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves the attacker attempting to map the network, identify system configurations, and gather information about the environment.
     - This is typically a stage that occurs after initial access and credential collection, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to move laterally.
     - It is less likely to occur immediately after credential collection and before the redirection to a YouTube clip.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
