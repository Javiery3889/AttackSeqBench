### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell command is used to download and run additional malware components.
   - The next step in the sequence is the establishment of communication with a C&C server using encoded Asruex malware.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the C&C communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **PowerShell Command Execution:** This is part of the **Execution** tactic, where the attacker runs a script or command to execute the malware.
   - **Download and Run Additional Malware Components:** This is part of the **Execution** tactic as well, where the malware is downloaded and executed.
   - **C&C Communication:** This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic, where the malware establishes communication with the C&C server.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. It is not typically a prerequisite for establishing C&C communication.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the victim's system. While it is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the execution of the PowerShell command.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. The PowerShell command to download and run additional malware components falls under this tactic.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not a prerequisite for establishing C&C communication.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the execution of a PowerShell command to download and run additional malware components, which is part of the **Execution** tactic.
   - After the execution, the malware establishes communication with the C&C server, which is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred before the C&C communication is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
