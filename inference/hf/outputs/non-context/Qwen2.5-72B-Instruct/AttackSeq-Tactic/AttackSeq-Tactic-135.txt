### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FamousSparrow engaged in **Resource Development** by exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities to acquire infrastructure such as domains and servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this Resource Development phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development** is a pre-attack phase where the adversary acquires the necessary resources to conduct an attack, such as domains, servers, and other infrastructure.
   - After acquiring the infrastructure, the next logical step in the attack lifecycle is to use this infrastructure to gain **Initial Access** to the target network or system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Impact**: This tactic involves the adversary's actions to achieve their goal, such as data theft or system disruption. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the adversary's methods to gain entry into the target network or system. This is the most logical next step after Resource Development.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While important, it is typically a pre-attack phase and not the immediate next step after Resource Development.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Initial Access
