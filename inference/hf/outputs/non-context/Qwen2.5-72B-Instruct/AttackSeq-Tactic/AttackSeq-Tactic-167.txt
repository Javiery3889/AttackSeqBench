### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the use of encrypted backdoors in memory and configuring loader DLLs to evade detection.
   - The next step in the sequence involves Lazarus backdoors connecting to specific servers for task management.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Steps:**
     - Using encrypted backdoors in memory.
     - Configuring loader DLLs to evade detection.
   - **Next Step:**
     - Connecting to specific servers for task management.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the target network. This typically includes techniques like spear-phishing, drive-by compromises, and exploiting vulnerabilities. The question already implies that the backdoors are in place, so this is not the next step.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is usually a pre-attack phase, and the question indicates that the backdoors are already in place and configured, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question mentions using encrypted backdoors and configuring loader DLLs to evade detection, which are part of this tactic. However, the next step is described as connecting to specific servers for task management, which is more aligned with another tactic.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. The question states that the backdoors are connecting to specific servers for task management, which is a clear indication of C2 activities.

### Final Reasoning:
- The sequence described in the question involves using encrypted backdoors and configuring loader DLLs to evade detection, which are part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
- The next step, connecting to specific servers for task management, is a clear indication of Command and Control activities.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
