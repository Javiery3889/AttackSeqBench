### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the SombRAT backdoor in the CostaRicto Campaign.
   - The backdoor established communication with C2 (Command and Control) servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to transfer the collected data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up C2 servers. However, this is not related to the transfer of collected data.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While establishing communication with C2 servers is part of this tactic, it does not specifically address the transfer of collected data.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to the attacker's control. This is the most relevant tactic for the transfer of collected data.
   - **D: Lateral Movement** - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access and control. It is not directly related to the transfer of collected data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the transfer of collected data, which aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
