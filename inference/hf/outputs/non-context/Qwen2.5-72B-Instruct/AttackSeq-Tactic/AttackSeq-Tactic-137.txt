### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing SparrowDoor on compromised systems using cmd.exe and vulnerabilities.
     - Attempting to evade detection by injecting the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary trying to understand the environment they have compromised. This could include network scanning, system information discovery, and other reconnaissance activities.
     - While discovery is a common early stage in an attack, it is not necessarily the most likely tactic to occur immediately after executing a payload and before attempting to evade detection.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves the adversary taking steps to maintain their access to the compromised system. This could include creating new accounts, modifying existing accounts, or setting up scheduled tasks.
     - Persistence is a logical next step after gaining initial access and executing a payload, as the adversary would want to ensure they can maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves the adversary preparing the infrastructure they will use to conduct the attack, such as setting up command and control (C2) servers or acquiring necessary tools.
     - This tactic is typically performed before the initial compromise and is not likely to occur between executing a payload and attempting to evade detection.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves the adversary running malicious code on the target system. This is the initial action of running the payload, which has already been described in the question.
     - Since the execution of SparrowDoor has already occurred, this is not the correct choice for the tactic that occurs next.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after executing SparrowDoor and before attempting to evade detection is **Persistence**. The adversary would likely want to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system before taking steps to evade detection.

**Final Answer: B: Persistence**
