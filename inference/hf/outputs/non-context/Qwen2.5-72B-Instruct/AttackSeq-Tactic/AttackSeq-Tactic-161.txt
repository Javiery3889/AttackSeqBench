### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Jupyter infostealer.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Avoiding triggering alerts by copying stolen information to another directory.
     - Using obfuscation patterns to evade detection.
     - Targeting and collecting data from Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browsers.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from various sources on the victim's system. This is a plausible step, but it is mentioned as occurring after the infostealer has already avoided alerts and used obfuscation.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending the collected data to an external location. This is typically a final step in the attack sequence, occurring after the data has been collected.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question mentions that the infostealer used obfuscation and copied stolen information to another directory to avoid triggering alerts, which are both defense evasion techniques.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is not mentioned in the question and does not fit the described sequence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves the infostealer using defense evasion techniques (obfuscation and copying stolen information) before targeting and collecting data from browsers.
   - The most plausible tactic that fits between these steps is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion
