### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions involving the SUNSPOT malware.
   - The key actions are:
     - Monitoring running processes for MsBuild.exe.
     - Detecting the targeted build.
     - Modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or service disruption. This does not align with the described sequence of monitoring and modifying source code.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While this might be a part of a broader attack, it does not directly precede the described actions of monitoring and modifying source code.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and running processes. Monitoring running processes for MsBuild.exe and detecting the targeted build aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - The Lateral Movement tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand access. While lateral movement might occur in the broader attack, it does not directly precede the described actions of monitoring and modifying source code.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is that the attacker first performed Discovery to monitor running processes and detect the targeted build before modifying the Orion source code.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
