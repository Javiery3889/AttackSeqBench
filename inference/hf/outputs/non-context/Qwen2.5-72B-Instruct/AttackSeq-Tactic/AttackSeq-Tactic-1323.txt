### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the threat actor Earth Wendigo.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Executing malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies.
     - Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Manipulating session keys and browser cookies could be part of defense evasion, but it is not the primary focus here.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. This is typically the first step in an attack and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in a network. Manipulating session keys and browser cookies could be a form of persistence, but it is not the primary focus here.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from a target. Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials is a clear example of data collection.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described involves:
     - **Step 1:** Executing malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and browser cookies.
     - **Step 2:** Intercepting HTTPS POST requests to steal webmail login credentials.
   - The manipulation of session keys and browser cookies is likely a preparatory step to facilitate the interception of HTTPS POST requests. This preparatory step is more aligned with **Collection** because it is part of the process of gathering the necessary data to steal webmail login credentials.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Collection
