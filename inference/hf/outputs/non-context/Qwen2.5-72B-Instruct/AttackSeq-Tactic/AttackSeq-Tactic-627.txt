### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that the attacker has already established command and control (C2) channels to maintain communication with the compromised network.
   - The next step in the attack sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to occur to complete the mission successfully.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**:
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data from the compromised network to an external location.
     - This is a common final step in many attack sequences, especially after the attacker has collected the desired data.
   - **B: Command and Control**:
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic used to establish and maintain control over the compromised network.
     - The question already states that C2 has been established, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Collection**:
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised network.
     - This step typically occurs after gaining access and establishing C2, but before exfiltration.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**:
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security systems.
     - This tactic is often used throughout the attack to maintain access and avoid detection, but it is not typically the final step.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attacker has already established C2, the next logical step to complete the mission successfully would be to exfiltrate the collected data.
   - Collection (C) is a necessary step but is typically followed by exfiltration.
   - Defense Evasion (D) is ongoing but not the final step.
   - Command and Control (B) has already been established.

### Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
