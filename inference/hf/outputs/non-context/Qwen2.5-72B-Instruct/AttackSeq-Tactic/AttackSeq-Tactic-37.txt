### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a PowerShell script avoids detection by operating in memory and leverages the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Avoiding detection by operating in memory:** This is a technique to evade detection mechanisms.
     - **Leveraging the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk:** This is a method to execute files in a stealthy manner.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from a target. The question does not mention any activities related to credential harvesting or access.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question explicitly mentions avoiding detection by operating in memory, which is a defense evasion technique.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves techniques to run malicious code. While the question does mention executing downloaded files, the focus is on the method of execution (in memory and using DCOM) to avoid detection, which is more aligned with defense evasion.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with and control the compromised system. The question does not mention any communication or control activities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**. The PowerShell script's actions to avoid detection and execute files in memory align with this tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
