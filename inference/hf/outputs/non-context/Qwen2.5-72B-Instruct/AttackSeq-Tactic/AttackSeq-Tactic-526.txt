### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers used images in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and included hidden tracking images to monitor if targets opened the emails.
   - The key elements are:
     - Bypassing security systems using images in phishing emails.
     - Using hidden tracking images to monitor email opens.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. While phishing is a common method for credential access, the question does not specifically mention obtaining credentials, but rather bypassing security and tracking email opens.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to gain higher-level permissions on a system. The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to avoid detection and analysis. Using images in phishing emails to bypass security systems and including hidden tracking images to monitor email opens are both methods of evading defenses.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves techniques that attackers use to move through a network to access additional systems. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**. The use of images in phishing emails to bypass security systems and the inclusion of hidden tracking images to monitor email opens are both techniques that fall under the Defense Evasion tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
