### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access is gained by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker uses POWERSHOWER to collect system information from infected machines.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and collecting system information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to gain access to the system.
   - **Collection:** Using POWERSHOWER to collect system information.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, but the question asks about the step that occurs after initial access.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment. This is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before collecting specific system information.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for the attack, such as developing or acquiring tools. This typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this can occur at various stages, it is not the most likely step immediately after gaining initial access and before collecting system information.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after gaining initial access, the attacker would perform Discovery to understand the system and network environment before collecting specific system information using POWERSHOWER.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
