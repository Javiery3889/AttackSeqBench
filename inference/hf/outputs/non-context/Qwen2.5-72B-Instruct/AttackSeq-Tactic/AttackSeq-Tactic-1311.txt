### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of Microsoft Word vulnerabilities in RTF documents.
   - The sequence includes dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder for persistence.
   - The next step in the sequence is downloading and decrypting the next stage of the infection chain from a server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** Exploiting Microsoft Word vulnerabilities in RTF documents.
   - **Persistence:** Dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder.
   - **Next Stage Download:** Downloading and decrypting the next stage of the infection chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While this is part of the initial exploit, it does not fit the sequence after persistence and before the next stage download.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it could be relevant, it does not specifically fit the sequence described.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system. The question explicitly mentions dropping 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder for persistence, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the sequence after persistence and before the next stage download.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Exploit:**
   - The attack starts with exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Word RTF documents. This is part of the **Execution** tactic.

2. **Persistence:**
   - The next step is to drop 'intel.wll' into the Word startup folder to ensure the malware persists across system reboots. This is a clear example of the **Persistence** tactic.

3. **Next Stage Download:**
   - After establishing persistence, the malware downloads and decrypts the next stage of the infection chain from a server. This step involves **Command and Control** and **Execution** tactics.

### Conclusion

The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that **Persistence** occurred after the initial exploit and before the next stage download.

**Final Answer: C: Persistence**
