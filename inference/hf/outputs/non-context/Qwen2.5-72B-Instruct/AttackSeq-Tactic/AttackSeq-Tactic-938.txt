### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where Tropic Trooper exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
   - The exploitation allowed the execution of commands and the installation of an MSI package on the system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial step where the attacker gains entry into the system. In this case, the initial access was achieved through the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **Execution:** After gaining access, the attacker executed commands and installed an MSI package. This is the next logical step in the attack sequence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the initial step where the attacker gains entry into the system. However, the question is asking about what happened **after** the initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This is the most logical next step after gaining initial access. The attacker executed commands and installed an MSI package, which aligns with the "Execution" tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions the execution of commands and installation of an MSI package, which is more aligned with the "Execution" tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is typically a pre-attack activity and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
