### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where BlueBravo's malware has already gathered system information such as username, computer name, network connections, and running processes.
   - The next step in the sequence involves enabling HTTPS communication encrypted with RC4 and Base64 encoding.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:** Gathering system information (Discovery).
   - **Next TTP:** Enabling HTTPS communication (Command and Control).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the sequence of enabling HTTPS communication after gathering system information.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system, which has already been described in the question. It does not fit the next step in the sequence.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While it is a crucial step, it does not specifically describe enabling HTTPS communication.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Enabling HTTPS communication for encrypted data transfer is a key aspect of C2 to avoid detection and ensure secure communication with the attacker's server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after gathering system information, the malware enables HTTPS communication for Command and Control.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
