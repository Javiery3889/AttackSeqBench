### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater exploited CVE-2017-0199 or used macros in files to gain access to victim systems through decoy documents.
   - The key point is that the initial access has already been achieved.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the victim's system. In this case, MuddyWater used CVE-2017-0199 or macros in files to achieve initial access.
   - The question asks what tactic most likely occurred **after** the initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this can occur after initial access, it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, such as setting up infrastructure. This typically occurs before initial access, not after.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This is the step that has already been completed, so it cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** After gaining initial access, the next logical step is to establish command and control to maintain persistence and control over the compromised system.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial access has been achieved, the most logical next step is to establish command and control to maintain control over the compromised system and to execute further actions.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
