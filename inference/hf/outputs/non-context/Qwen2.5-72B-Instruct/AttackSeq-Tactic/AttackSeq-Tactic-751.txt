### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exfiltration of harvested documents to the C&C server.
     - Use of both HTTP and HTTPS for communication with the C&C infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Command and Control (C2):** The malware uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with the C&C server.
     2. **Exfiltration:** The harvested documents are exfiltrated to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - This is the final step in the sequence, where the harvested documents are sent to the C&C server.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves moving through the network to expand access. It is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server or the exfiltration of data.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is the step where the malware communicates with the C&C server using HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the system. It is not directly related to the communication with the C&C server or the exfiltration of data.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Command and Control (C2):** The malware establishes communication with the C&C server using HTTP and HTTPS.
     2. **Exfiltration:** The harvested documents are exfiltrated to the C&C server.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the exfiltration and after the communication with the C&C server is **Command and Control (C2)**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
