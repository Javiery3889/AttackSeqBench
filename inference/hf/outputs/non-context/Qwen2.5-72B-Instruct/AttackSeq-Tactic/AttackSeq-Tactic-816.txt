### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the BlackEnergy malware.
   - It mentions that before employing techniques to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and defeat signed driver requirements, BlackEnergy gained entry to state organizations and businesses in Ukraine and Poland.
   - The entry method involved spear-phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.
     2. Bypassing UAC and defeating signed driver requirements (Defense Evasion).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**:
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis, such as bypassing UAC and defeating signed driver requirements. However, this is a subsequent step after gaining initial access.
   - **B: Command and Control**:
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It is not the initial step in gaining access.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**:
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not the initial step in gaining access.
   - **D: Initial Access**:
     - This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in a network, which aligns with the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that BlackEnergy first used Initial Access techniques to gain entry through spear-phishing emails with malicious MS Office documents.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
