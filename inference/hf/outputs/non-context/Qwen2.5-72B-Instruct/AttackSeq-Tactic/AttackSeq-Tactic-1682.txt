### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the adversary:
     - Executed PowerShell one-liner commands to install Cobalt Strike in memory using scheduled tasks.
     - Escalated privileges through password spraying and domain admin credential acquisition.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems and resources. This typically occurs after initial access and often after some form of persistence or privilege escalation.
   - **B: Persistence:**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the adversary maintains access to the system over time. This can be achieved through various methods, including scheduled tasks, which aligns with the use of PowerShell one-liner commands to install Cobalt Strike in memory.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. The question explicitly states that privilege escalation occurred through password spraying and domain admin credential acquisition, so this is the next step in the sequence.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access involves the adversary's first entry into the network. This typically occurs before any other TTPs, including persistence and privilege escalation.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question suggests that the adversary first gained initial access, then used PowerShell one-liner commands to install Cobalt Strike in memory using scheduled tasks, which is a form of persistence.
   - After establishing persistence, the adversary then escalated privileges through password spraying and domain admin credential acquisition.
   - Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before privilege escalation is persistence.

### Final Answer: B: Persistence
