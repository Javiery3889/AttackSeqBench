### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the adversary tricked users into executing malware using malicious DLLs via DLL Hijacking.
   - The key TTP mentioned is "DLL Hijacking," which is a technique used to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate program.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is typically done after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold. It is not a prerequisite for DLL Hijacking.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. DLL Hijacking is a method of execution, so it is logical that the adversary would need to execute the malicious DLL. However, the question is asking about what happened before the DLL Hijacking.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While persistence techniques can be used after DLL Hijacking, they are not a necessary precursor.
   - **D: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. DLL Hijacking itself is a form of defense evasion, but the question is asking about what happened before the DLL Hijacking. Defense evasion techniques like obfuscation or living off the land might be used to prepare for DLL Hijacking.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversary first needed to execute the initial payload or gain a foothold on the system before they could use DLL Hijacking to execute malicious code.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before DLL Hijacking is "Execution."

### Final Answer: B: Execution
