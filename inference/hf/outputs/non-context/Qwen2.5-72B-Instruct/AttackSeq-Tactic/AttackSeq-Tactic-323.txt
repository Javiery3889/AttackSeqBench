### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where a dropper is used to extract and save a malicious driver in the Windows Temp directory for persistence.
   - The next step in the sequence is that the driver employs tricks to hide from security products during startup.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Dropper extracts and saves the malicious driver in the Windows Temp directory.
   - **Subsequent Action:** The driver uses techniques to hide from security products during startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Hiding from security products during startup is a classic example of defense evasion.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques for stealing data from a network. The question does not mention any data exfiltration.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques for gathering information about the system and network. The question does not mention any discovery activities.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems. While the initial action of saving the driver in the Temp directory is a form of persistence, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is hiding from security products.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the driver is saved for persistence, it employs techniques to hide from security products, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

### Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
