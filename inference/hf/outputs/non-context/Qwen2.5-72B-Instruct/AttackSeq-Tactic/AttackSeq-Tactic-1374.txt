### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor FIN13.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Process memory dumping of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).
     - Targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting.
     - Using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with systems they control within a target network. It typically occurs after initial access and is used to maintain control and execute further actions. However, the question does not mention any communication or control activities, so this is less likely.
   - **Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to gather information about the target network and host configurations. The use of native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations aligns well with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future operations. While reconnaissance can involve gathering information, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and is more about understanding the target environment rather than using malware to gather information.
   - **Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials from the target. The question mentions process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials, which are techniques under the Credential Access tactic. However, the question asks what occurred **before** the use of native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information, which suggests a different tactic.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. **Credential Access:** Process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials.
     2. **Discovery:** Using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - The question asks what tactic occurred before the Discovery phase, which is the Credential Access phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Credential Access
