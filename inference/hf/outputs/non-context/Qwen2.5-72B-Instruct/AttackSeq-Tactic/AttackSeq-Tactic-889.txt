### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where proprietary data from Visma was compressed using WinRAR and then exfiltrated to Dropbox via cURL for Windows.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Compression of Data:** The data was compressed using WinRAR.
   - **Exfiltration:** The compressed data was exfiltrated to Dropbox using cURL for Windows.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or service disruption. This is typically a final step in an attack and does not logically precede data compression and exfiltration.
   - **B: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from the target system. This is a logical step that would occur before compressing and exfiltrating the data. The attacker needs to collect the data before they can compress and exfiltrate it.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - The Command and Control (C2) tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for the attack, it is not directly related to the specific actions of compressing and exfiltrating data.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - The Defense Evasion tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While this is important for the overall attack, it is not a direct precursor to the specific actions of compressing and exfiltrating data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most logical sequence is that the attacker first collects the data (Collection), then compresses it, and finally exfiltrates it. Therefore, the Collection tactic is the most likely to have occurred before the data was compressed and exfiltrated.

### Final Answer: B: Collection
