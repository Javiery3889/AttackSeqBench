### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving Taidoor malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses in GET and POST requests for HTTP communication.**
     - **Uploading files to the C&C server to exfiltrate victim data.**
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the context of the sequence described, which is more about communication and data exfiltration.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While obfuscating MAC addresses could be a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the network traffic and before the data exfiltration.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The use of identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses in GET and POST requests suggests that the malware is establishing or maintaining C2 communication. This is a logical step before exfiltrating data.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. While persistence is important, it is typically established earlier in the attack lifecycle, not necessarily between network communication and data exfiltration.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that the Command and Control (C2) tactic occurred after the identifiable network traffic with obfuscated MAC addresses and before the malware uploaded files to the C&C server to exfiltrate victim data.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
