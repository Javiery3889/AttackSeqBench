### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already employed defense evasion techniques.
   - The specific tool mentioned is 'bird.exe', which is used to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attacker has already used techniques to avoid detection, such as verifying Google reachability and implementing modular design in the malware.
   - **Use of 'bird.exe':** The tool 'bird.exe' is used to gather detailed information about the victim's system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not align with the use of 'bird.exe' to gather information.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. While it is a crucial part of the attack, it does not directly relate to gathering detailed information about the victim's system.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the victim's system, such as network configuration, system details, and user information. The use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information aligns well with this tactic.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While defense evasion is mentioned earlier in the sequence, the use of 'bird.exe' is specifically for gathering information, not for evading defenses.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the use of 'bird.exe' to gather detailed information about the victim's system, aligns with the **Discovery** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
