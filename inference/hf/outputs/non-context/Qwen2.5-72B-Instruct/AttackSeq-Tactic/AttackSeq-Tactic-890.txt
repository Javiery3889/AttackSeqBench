### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions: compressing proprietary data using WinRAR, uploading files to a Dropbox account using cURL, and using custom malware for data exfiltration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the data exfiltration using custom malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Data Compression:** Using WinRAR to compress proprietary data.
   - **Data Upload:** Uploading the compressed files to a Dropbox account using cURL.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** Using custom malware to transfer the data out of the environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure (e.g., Dropbox account) and tools (e.g., custom malware). However, this typically happens before the actual attack sequence begins.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While important, it is not directly related to the sequence of actions described in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for executing the attack, it is not the immediate precursor to data exfiltration.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing and transferring data out of the target environment. The question already mentions the use of custom malware for exfiltration, so this is the final step in the sequence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the question (compressing data, uploading to Dropbox, and using custom malware for exfiltration) suggests that the data exfiltration is the final step.
   - The step that most likely occurred before the exfiltration using custom malware is the **Command and Control (C2)**, as it is necessary to maintain control over the compromised system to execute the exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
