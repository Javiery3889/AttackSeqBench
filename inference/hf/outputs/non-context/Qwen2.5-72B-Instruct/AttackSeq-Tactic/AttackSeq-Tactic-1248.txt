### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Mustang Panda used a double extension trick to deliver PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.
   - The double extension trick is a technique used to trick users into opening malicious files by disguising the file extension (e.g., `file.txt.exe`).
   - PlugX and Cobalt Strike are well-known malware and post-exploitation tools used for maintaining access and furthering the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The double extension trick is used to gain initial access to the target system by tricking the user into opening the malicious file.
   - **Execution:** Once the file is opened, the malware (PlugX and Cobalt Strike) is executed.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike is often associated with techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control channels to communicate with the compromised system. While this is a crucial step, it typically follows the initial access and execution phases.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system over time. While persistence is important, it is usually established after initial access and execution.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the system. The double extension trick is a method of initial access, but the question asks what happens after this.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike is often associated with defense evasion, as these tools are designed to bypass security defenses.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question asks what tactic most likely occurred after the double extension trick and the delivery of PlugX and Cobalt Strike, the most plausible answer is **Defense Evasion**. This is because the primary purpose of using these tools is to evade detection and maintain a low profile on the compromised system.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
