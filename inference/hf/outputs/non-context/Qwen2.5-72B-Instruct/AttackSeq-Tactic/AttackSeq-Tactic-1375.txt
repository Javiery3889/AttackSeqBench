### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where FIN13 has already performed internal reconnaissance and gathered information on network configurations and services.
   - The next step involves using WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:** This is part of the "Discovery" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Using WMI and Custom Web Shells:** This is part of the "Lateral Movement" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure and tools. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not directly related to the internal reconnaissance and information gathering described in the question.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the target network, systems, and users. This aligns with the internal reconnaissance and information gathering mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access and control. Using WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations is a clear example of lateral movement.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial techniques used to gain a foothold in the target network. It typically occurs before the discovery phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question states that FIN13 has already performed internal reconnaissance and gathered information on network configurations and services. This is a clear indication of the "Discovery" tactic.
   - After gathering this information, the next logical step is to use the gathered information to move laterally within the network, which is the "Lateral Movement" tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that "Discovery" occurred before "Lateral Movement."

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
