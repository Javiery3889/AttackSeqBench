### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was achieved through emails with malicious documents.
   - The next step in the sequence is Dridex malware communicating with its command and control (C2) servers via encrypted POST requests.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the initial access and the C2 communication.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Achieved through emails with malicious documents.
   - **C2 Communication:** Dridex malware communicates with C2 servers via encrypted POST requests.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access. This is typically a later stage in an attack, after the initial foothold has been established and the attacker has some level of control.
     - It is less likely to occur immediately after initial access and before C2 communication.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This is usually a later stage in an attack, after the attacker has gained access and identified valuable data.
     - It is unlikely to occur before C2 communication.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running the malicious code on the victim's system. This is a critical step after initial access, where the malicious document is opened and the malware is executed.
     - This is a logical step before the malware can communicate with C2 servers.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While this can occur at various stages of an attack, it is often a concurrent or subsequent step to execution.
     - It is less likely to be the immediate next step after initial access and before C2 communication.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the initial access through emails with malicious documents, the next step is the execution of the malware. This execution is necessary for the malware to establish communication with its C2 servers.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
