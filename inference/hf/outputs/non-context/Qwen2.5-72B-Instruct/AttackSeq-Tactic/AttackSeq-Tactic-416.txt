### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs:
     - **Credential Dumping:** Using Mimikatz to extract credentials.
     - **Reconnaissance:** Executing commands to discover remote systems, user accounts, and network topology.
     - **Leveraging Collected Credentials:** Using the extracted credentials to execute commands on other systems via webshells.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network to expand access and control. This aligns with the use of collected credentials to execute commands on other systems.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target network and systems. This was already performed in the initial phase of the attack.
   - **C: Credential Access:**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials. This was also performed in the initial phase with Mimikatz.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. This was also part of the initial phase of the attack.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred when the actors used the collected credentials to execute commands on other systems. This is a clear indication of **Lateral Movement**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Lateral Movement
