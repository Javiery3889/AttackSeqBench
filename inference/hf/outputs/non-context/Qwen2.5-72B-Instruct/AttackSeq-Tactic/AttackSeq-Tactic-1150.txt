### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an initial payload delivery via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial payload delivery.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The RTF file is used to deliver the initial payload, which is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Exploitation:** The RTF file exploits CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 to gain access to the system.
   - **Delivery of Initial Payload:** The payload is delivered to the system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system. While this can occur after initial access, it is not the immediate next step after delivering the initial payload.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running the delivered payload on the system. After the initial payload is delivered, the next logical step is to execute it.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While this is a common next step, it typically follows execution of the initial payload.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic has already occurred with the delivery of the initial payload via the RTF file.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical next step after delivering the initial payload is to execute it. Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that involves running the payload on the system.

### Final Answer: B: Execution
