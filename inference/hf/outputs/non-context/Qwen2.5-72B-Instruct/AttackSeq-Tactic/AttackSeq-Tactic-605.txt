### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where FIN4 has already stolen credentials and campaign codes.
   - These stolen credentials and codes are then transmitted to infrastructure using specific servers (e.g., junomaat81[.]us and lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com).

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - **Credential Access**: FIN4 has already stolen credentials and campaign codes.
     - **Exfiltration**: The stolen credentials and codes are transmitted to the attacker's infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data from a compromised system to an external location controlled by the attacker. Given that the stolen credentials and codes are being transmitted to the attacker's infrastructure, this aligns perfectly with the Exfiltration tactic.
   - **B: Command and Control**: This tactic involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial part of the attack lifecycle, it does not specifically describe the act of transmitting stolen data.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This tactic involves the methods used to obtain credentials. The question already states that the credentials have been stolen, so this tactic has already occurred.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While reconnaissance is important, it does not describe the act of transmitting stolen data.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
