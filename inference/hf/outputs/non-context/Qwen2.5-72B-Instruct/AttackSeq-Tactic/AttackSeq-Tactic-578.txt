### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through spear-phishing using malicious LNK files.
   - The attacker then ensured persistence by adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through spear-phishing with malicious LNK files.
   - **Persistence:** Ensured by adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Persistence**
     - This is the tactic that the question explicitly mentions as occurring after gaining initial access. The attacker added 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not mentioned in the question as occurring before the persistence step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is often a preliminary step, the question does not mention it occurring between initial access and persistence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While execution is a necessary step to gain initial access, the question already states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing. The next step mentioned is persistence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access:**
   - The attacker gains initial access by distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
2. **Next Step:**
   - The question states that the attacker then ensured persistence by adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
3. **Tactic Before Persistence:**
   - The most logical step between gaining initial access and ensuring persistence is the execution of the malicious LNK file to gain a foothold in the system.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Execution
