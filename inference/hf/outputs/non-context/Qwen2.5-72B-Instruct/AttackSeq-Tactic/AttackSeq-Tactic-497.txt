### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by Russian-speaking cybercriminals.
   - They used remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.
   - They then explored the financial systems of the targeted organizations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attackers gain entry into the network, which they did using remote administration tools.
   - **Credential Access:** This is where they obtained the system administrators' credentials.
   - **Discovery:** This is the step where they explored the financial systems of the targeted organizations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This is the first step in the attack sequence, but the question asks what happened **after** gaining system administrators' credentials and exploring financial systems.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - This aligns with the exploration of the financial systems, which is a logical next step after gaining access and credentials.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - This typically involves running malicious code or commands, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - This is the final stage where the attackers cause damage or achieve their objectives, which is not mentioned in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers performed **Discovery** after gaining system administrators' credentials and exploring financial systems.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
