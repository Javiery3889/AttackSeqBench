### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by an attacker.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Deleting the original malicious file to evade defenses.
     - Using hidden directories as part of a defense evasion strategy.
     - Targeting registry keys for stored passwords.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - The Collection tactic involves gathering data from the system, which could include files, documents, and other information. However, targeting registry keys for stored passwords is more specific to obtaining credentials rather than general data collection.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - The Defense Evasion tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While deleting the original malicious file and using hidden directories are part of defense evasion, targeting registry keys for stored passwords is not typically categorized under this tactic.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - The Credential Access tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. Targeting registry keys for stored passwords is a direct example of credential access.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - The Privilege Escalation tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. While obtaining stored passwords can be a step towards privilege escalation, the primary focus here is on accessing the credentials themselves.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of targeting registry keys for stored passwords, aligns with the **Credential Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Credential Access**
