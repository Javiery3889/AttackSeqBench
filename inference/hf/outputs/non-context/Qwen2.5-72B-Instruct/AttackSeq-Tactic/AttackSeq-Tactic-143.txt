### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the malware **SparrowDoor** used by the threat actor **FamousSparrow**.
   - The sequence includes establishing an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C (Command and Control) server and data exfiltration over the same channel.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the target network.
   - **Establishing an encrypted HTTPS connection with the C&C server:** This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - **Data exfiltration over the same channel:** This is part of the **Exfiltration** tactic.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic occurs at the very beginning of the attack, before any C&C communication is established. Therefore, it cannot be the tactic that occurs after the C&C connection is established.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. It is a plausible step that could occur after the C&C connection is established and before data exfiltration.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already states that the C&C connection is established, so this cannot be the tactic that occurs after the C&C connection is established.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access** (not mentioned in the question but assumed to have occurred).
     2. **Command and Control** (establishing the C&C connection).
     3. **Collection** (gathering data to exfiltrate).
     4. **Exfiltration** (sending the collected data over the C&C channel).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Collection
