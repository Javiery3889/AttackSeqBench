### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the execution of PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access to the system through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros.
   - **Execution:** The attacker uses PowerShell scripts to decode and run embedded backdoor components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This choice aligns with the step where PowerShell scripts are executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components.
   - **Answer Choice B: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial access to gather information about the target. It does not fit the sequence described in the question.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - This choice describes the first step in the sequence, where the attacker gains access through the malicious document. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This step typically occurs after gaining initial access and executing initial payloads, so it does not fit the sequence described in the question.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Execution
