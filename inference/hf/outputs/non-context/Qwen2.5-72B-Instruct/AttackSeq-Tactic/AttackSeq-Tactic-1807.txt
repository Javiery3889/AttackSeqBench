### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers modified the Windows registry to ensure persistence and then collected credentials using legitimate applications and saved them to text files.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence**: Modifying the Windows registry to ensure persistence.
   - **Credential Access**: Collecting credentials using legitimate applications and saving them to text files.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. It typically occurs before the initial access and is not likely to occur between persistence and credential access.
   - **B: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial entry into the target network. It usually happens before persistence and credential access, not between them.
   - **C: Credential Access**: This is the tactic that involves collecting credentials, which is explicitly mentioned as occurring after the persistence step. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It is plausible that attackers might perform defense evasion techniques after ensuring persistence to maintain their foothold and before collecting credentials to avoid detection.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred between modifying the Windows registry for persistence and collecting credentials is **Defense Evasion**. This is because attackers often take steps to avoid detection and maintain their presence in the network before proceeding to more sensitive actions like credential collection.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
