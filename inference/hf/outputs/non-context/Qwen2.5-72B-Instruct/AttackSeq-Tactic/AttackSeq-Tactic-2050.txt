### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The XAgent app is running in the background on iOS 7 devices or exhibiting diminished functionality on iOS 8. The app collects data such as geo-location and text messages.
- **Key Action**: The data is sent out via HTTP POST requests to the C2 (Command and Control) server.
- **Tactic to Identify**: The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the data was sent out.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
  - **Description**: Discovery involves the adversary attempting to map the network and understand the environment.
  - **Relevance**: While discovery is important for understanding the environment, it is not directly related to the collection and exfiltration of data.

- **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
  - **Description**: Credential Access involves the adversary attempting to obtain credentials to access systems.
  - **Relevance**: This tactic is more about gaining access to systems, which is not directly related to the collection and exfiltration of data.

- **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
  - **Description**: Privilege Escalation involves the adversary attempting to gain higher-level permissions.
  - **Relevance**: This tactic is about gaining more access within the system, which is not directly related to the collection and exfiltration of data.

- **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
  - **Description**: Command and Control involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system.
  - **Relevance**: This tactic is directly related to the communication between the compromised device and the C2 server. The data collected by the app is sent out via HTTP POST requests to the C2 server, which is a clear indication of Command and Control.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
1. **Data Collection**: The XAgent app collects data such as geo-location and text messages.
2. **Data Exfiltration**: The collected data is sent out via HTTP POST requests to the C2 server.
3. **Tactic Analysis**:
   - **Discovery**: Not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **Credential Access**: Not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control**: Directly related to the communication and exfiltration of data to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
