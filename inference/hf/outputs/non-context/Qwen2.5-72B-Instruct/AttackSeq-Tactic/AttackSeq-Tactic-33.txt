### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the adversary gained initial access to target systems via phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros.
   - The key point here is the sequence of events leading up to the initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**:
     - Defense Evasion tactics are used to avoid detection and analysis after gaining access to a system. This is not a pre-access tactic.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**:
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This is a pre-access tactic and is often the first step in a cyber attack.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**:
     - Lateral Movement is used to move through a network after gaining initial access. This is a post-access tactic.
   - **D: Initial Access**:
     - Initial Access is the tactic used to gain entry into the target system. The question already states that the adversary gained initial access via phishing emails, so this is not a pre-access tactic.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the adversary first conducted **Reconnaissance** to gather information about the target, which would then be used to craft the phishing emails and gain initial access.

### Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
