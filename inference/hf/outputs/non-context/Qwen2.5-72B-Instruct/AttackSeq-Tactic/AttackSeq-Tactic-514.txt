### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in Operation Sharpshooter.
   - The sequence includes reconnaissance activities, followed by an unknown step, and then the execution of shellcode within Word macros to deliver the Rising Sun implant payload.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers identified English-speaking targets.
   - **Unknown Step:** This is the step we need to determine.
   - **Execution:** The shellcode within Word macros executed the Rising Sun implant payload.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This is the final step in the sequence, where the shellcode is executed. It cannot be the step that occurs after reconnaissance but before the execution.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to the target system. It is a logical step after reconnaissance and before the execution of the payload. The attackers would need to gain initial access to the system to deliver the Word document with the macro.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target system. It typically occurs after the implant is executed and the attackers have established a foothold. It does not fit the sequence described.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It typically occurs after the implant is executed and the attackers have established a foothold. It does not fit the sequence described.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is: Reconnaissance → Initial Access → Execution.
   - Therefore, the step that most likely occurred after reconnaissance but before the execution of the shellcode is Initial Access.

### Final Answer: B: Initial Access
