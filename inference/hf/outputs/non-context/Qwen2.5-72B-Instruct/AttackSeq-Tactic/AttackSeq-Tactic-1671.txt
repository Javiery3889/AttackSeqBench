### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where DNSpionage used spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents to gain initial access.
   - Before this initial access, the attackers needed to understand the victims' network infrastructure and identify valuable targets such as .gov domains and a private airline.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Understanding the victims' network infrastructure.
     2. Identifying valuable targets.
     3. Gaining initial access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating accounts, and developing malware. It does not specifically involve understanding the victim's network or identifying targets.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target, including network infrastructure and identifying valuable targets. This aligns perfectly with the described activities of understanding the victims' network and identifying .gov domains and a private airline.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves increasing the attacker's level of access within the target's network. It occurs after initial access has been gained and does not fit the pre-access activities described.
   - **D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the final stages of an attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It does not fit the pre-access activities described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Understanding the Victims' Network Infrastructure:**
   - This activity is part of the reconnaissance phase, where attackers gather information about the target's network to plan their attack.
2. **Identifying Valuable Targets:**
   - This is also a part of the reconnaissance phase, where attackers identify specific targets within the network that are of high value, such as .gov domains and a private airline.
3. **Gaining Initial Access:**
   - This is the next step after reconnaissance, where the attackers use the gathered information to execute their attack, in this case, through spear-phishing with malicious Microsoft Office documents.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance
