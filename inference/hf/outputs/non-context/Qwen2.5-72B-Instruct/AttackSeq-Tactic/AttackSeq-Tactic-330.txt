### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the Bankshot implant.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Downloading and running a DLL implant from a malicious domain.
     - Evading detection by wiping files and content from the targeted system.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. This could be a step in the attack sequence, but it is not necessarily the most immediate step after downloading and running the DLL implant.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves obtaining credentials to access systems or accounts. This is a common step in many attacks but is not typically the immediate next step after downloading and running a DLL.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a system. The question already states that the DLL implant was downloaded and run, so this step has already occurred.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. This is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before evading detection.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. Download and run the DLL implant (Execution).
     2. Ensure the implant remains on the system (Persistence).
     3. Evade detection by wiping files and content.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between the execution of the DLL and the evasion of detection is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: D: Persistence
