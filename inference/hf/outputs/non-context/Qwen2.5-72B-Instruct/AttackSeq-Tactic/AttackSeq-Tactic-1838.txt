### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where CTU analysts sinkholed the 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging connections and gathering statistics.
   - The key action here is the redirection of infected traffic to servers for logging and gathering statistics.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sinkholing of domains and redirection of traffic is a defensive action taken to disrupt the attacker's command and control (C2) infrastructure.
   - After the traffic is redirected, the next logical step is to analyze the traffic to understand the attacker's activities and gather intelligence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. It is not relevant to the scenario of logging and gathering statistics.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. It is not relevant to the scenario of logging and gathering statistics.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves the attacker's ability to communicate with and control the compromised systems. The redirection of traffic to logging servers is a direct disruption of the C2 channel, making this the most relevant choice.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves the attacker's efforts to gather information about the victim's environment. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it is not the most relevant to the scenario of logging and gathering statistics after sinkholing.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after the sinkholing and redirection of infected traffic is the disruption of the Command and Control (C2) channel.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
