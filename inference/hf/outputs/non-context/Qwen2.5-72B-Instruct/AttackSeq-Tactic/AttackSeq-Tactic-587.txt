### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the attackers exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
   - The context is Operation Aurora, a well-known cyber attack that involved the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to execute malicious activities.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in Operation Aurora can be broken down as follows:
     1. **Initial Access:** The attackers need to gain initial access to the target system.
     2. **Exploitation of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Once initial access is gained, the attackers exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer.
     3. **Execution:** The attackers execute their malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It is typically used after gaining initial access and executing the initial payload.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. It is a step that occurs after gaining initial access and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the target system. It is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves stealing credentials to gain access to the target system. It can be used before or after initial access, but it is not the primary method for gaining initial access in this context.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that the attackers first gained **Initial Access** to the target system, then exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, and finally executed their malicious activities.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred before the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
