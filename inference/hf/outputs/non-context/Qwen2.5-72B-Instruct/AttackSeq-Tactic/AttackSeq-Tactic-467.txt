### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat actor Gallmaker.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting the DDE protocol for remote code execution without leaving artifacts on disk.
     - Establishing three primary IP addresses for their C&C (Command and Control) infrastructure.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code. The question already states that the DDE protocol was exploited for remote code execution, which falls under the Execution tactic. Therefore, this is not the tactic that occurred after the initial execution.
   - **B: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The question states that the C&C infrastructure was established after the initial execution. Therefore, this is the final step in the sequence, not the intermediate step.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the compromised system. While this is a common step in many attack sequences, the question does not provide any specific indication that privilege escalation occurred between the initial execution and the establishment of C&C infrastructure.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. The question mentions that the initial execution was done without leaving artifacts on disk, which is a form of defense evasion. However, defense evasion can also occur after initial execution to maintain persistence and avoid detection while setting up C&C infrastructure.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the initial execution was done without leaving artifacts on disk, it is likely that the threat actor continued to use defense evasion techniques to avoid detection while setting up the C&C infrastructure.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between the initial execution and the establishment of C&C infrastructure is **Defense Evasion**.

### Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
