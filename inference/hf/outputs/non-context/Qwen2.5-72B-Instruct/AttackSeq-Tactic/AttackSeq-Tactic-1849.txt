### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where BlueDelta collected emails by creating a filter in the Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward emails to an attacker-controlled address.
   - The key action here is the collection and forwarding of emails.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The attacker has already gained access to the Roundcube email system.
   - The attacker has created a filter to forward emails to an external address.
   - The next logical step would be to send the collected emails to the attacker's control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining command and control over the compromised system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs before the collection and exfiltration of data.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the network, system, and environment. This is usually done to understand the target better and plan further actions. It is not the most likely next step after collecting emails.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the attacker stealing and transferring data from the compromised system to an external location. Given that the emails are being forwarded to an attacker-controlled address, this is the most logical next step.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the attacker disrupting or destroying the target's operations. While this can be a goal, it is not the immediate next step after collecting emails.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the scenario, is that the attacker is exfiltrating the collected emails to an external address.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
