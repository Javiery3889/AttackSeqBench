### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT10, specifically the use of dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP) for interconnected command and control infrastructure.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS domains:** This is typically used for maintaining command and control (C2) infrastructure.
   - **Robocopy and PSCP:** These tools are often used for file transfer and secure copy, which can be part of the exfiltration or lateral movement phases.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - The use of dynamic-DNS domains is a clear indicator of C2. However, the question asks what happened **after** these actions.
   - **B: Credential Access:**
     - Credential access involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. This is typically an earlier phase in the attack lifecycle, not something that follows the establishment of C2 infrastructure.
   - **C: Collection:**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the compromised system. This could occur after establishing C2, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network and systems to plan further actions. This is a logical next step after establishing C2, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to move laterally or collect data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after establishing the C2 infrastructure using dynamic-DNS domains and tools like Robocopy and PSCP, the next logical step would be to perform discovery to understand the network and systems.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
