### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the threat group "Before Dropping Elephant."
   - The group initially targeted diplomatic and economic entities with a focus on gathering information.
   - They gained initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence starts with gathering information about the targets.
   - This is followed by gaining initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in a target's network. While this is a crucial step, it is not the first step in the sequence described.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves actions taken to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not fit the initial information-gathering phase.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to map the network and understand the environment. While this is a common step after gaining initial access, it does not align with the initial focus on gathering information about the targets.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the target before the actual attack. This aligns perfectly with the described focus on gathering information about diplomatic and economic entities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs starts with **Reconnaissance** as the group gathers information about the targets before moving on to Initial Access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
