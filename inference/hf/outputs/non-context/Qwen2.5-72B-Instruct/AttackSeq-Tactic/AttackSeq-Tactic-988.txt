### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where attackers first exploited CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers used the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain persistence on the victim systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2021-26855 in MS Exchange.
   - **Persistence:** Using the Windows Task Scheduler to maintain access.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this could be part of the attack, it is typically associated with the initial stages of the attack, not necessarily between gaining initial access and setting up persistence.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to effectively maintain access.
   - **C: Persistence:** This is the tactic that the attackers used after the described sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is typically performed before gaining initial access, not between gaining initial access and setting up persistence.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and setting up persistence is **Discovery**. The attackers would need to understand the victim's environment to effectively use the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
