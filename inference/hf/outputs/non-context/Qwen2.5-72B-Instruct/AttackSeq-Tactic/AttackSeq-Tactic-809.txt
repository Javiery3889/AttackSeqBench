### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where LYCEUM used obfuscated VBA macros within Excel files to drop the DanBot malware.
   - The next step in the sequence is that they performed discovery operations by targeting HR and IT personnel for further account compromise.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the discovery operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery** - This is the tactic that is explicitly mentioned in the question as occurring after the initial compromise. Therefore, it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Credential Access** - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is a logical step before performing discovery operations, especially when targeting HR and IT personnel.
   - **C: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to the system. While it is a common next step, it is not as immediate as obtaining credentials before performing discovery.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is typically a step that follows initial access and credential access.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial compromise was achieved using obfuscated VBA macros to drop DanBot malware.
   - Before performing discovery operations, the attackers would need to ensure they have the necessary credentials to access and move laterally within the network.
   - Targeting HR and IT personnel for further account compromise suggests that the attackers are trying to obtain additional credentials.
   - Therefore, the most logical step before discovery is to gain credential access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Credential Access
