### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where a threat actor gains entry via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents.
   - These documents then download base64-encoded CAB files through embedded scripts.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor gains entry via spear phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malicious documents contain embedded scripts that download and execute the base64-encoded CAB files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that occurs after the threat actor has already gained control and is causing damage, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the sequence described, which is focused on gaining and executing initial access.
   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - Execution is the tactic where the threat actor runs malicious code. This aligns well with the description of the embedded scripts downloading and executing the base64-encoded CAB files.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the tactic where the threat actor steals data and sends it out of the network. This does not align with the sequence described, which is focused on gaining and executing initial access.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the tactic where the threat actor gains entry into the network. This is the first step in the sequence described, but the question asks what happens after gaining entry.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is that after gaining entry via spear phishing, the next step is the execution of the malicious code.

**Final Answer: B: Execution**
