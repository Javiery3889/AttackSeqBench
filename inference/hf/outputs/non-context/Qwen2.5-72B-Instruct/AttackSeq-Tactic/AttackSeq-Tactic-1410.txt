### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through the injection of malicious code into a dynamic library of 3CX software.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker ensured continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Injection of malicious code into a dynamic library of 3CX software.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs immediately after gaining initial access and is part of the initial access process itself.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the victim's environment. While discovery can occur after initial access, it is not directly related to ensuring continued functionality.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the victim's system over time. Ensuring continued functionality by abusing a legitimate 3CX software component is a clear example of persistence.
   - **D: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack. This typically occurs before initial access and is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves gaining initial access and then ensuring continued functionality. The step of ensuring continued functionality is a clear example of the **Persistence** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Persistence
