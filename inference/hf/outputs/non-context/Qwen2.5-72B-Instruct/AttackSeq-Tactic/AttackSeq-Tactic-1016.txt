### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where initial access was gained through phishing pages and malicious macros.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers used obfuscation techniques and loaders to hide and execute their code.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing pages and malicious macros.
   - **Obfuscation and Loaders:** Use of aaencode algorithm and loaders like Buer and Smoke.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attackers gain entry into the system. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred **after** initial access.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running the attacker's code on the victim's system. After gaining initial access, the attackers would need to execute their code, which aligns with the use of obfuscation techniques and loaders.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. While this is a common next step, the question specifically mentions the use of obfuscation and loaders, which are more aligned with the execution phase.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to the system. While persistence is a crucial step, it typically follows execution and discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers first gain initial access using phishing pages and malicious macros.
   - After gaining access, they need to execute their code to achieve their objectives.
   - To avoid detection, they use obfuscation techniques and loaders, which are part of the execution phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Execution
