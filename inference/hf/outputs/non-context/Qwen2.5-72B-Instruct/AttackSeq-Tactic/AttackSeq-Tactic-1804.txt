### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence that begins with an email containing a PDF attachment.
   - The PDF attachment is actually a disguised executable file.
   - The attack sequence is initiated when Susan opens the executable file.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The initial step is the delivery of the email with the PDF attachment.
   - The next step is the execution of the disguised executable file when Susan opens it.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access** - This tactic involves gaining initial entry into a system. Sending an email with a malicious attachment is a common method of initial access, but the attack sequence is not fully initiated until the attachment is opened.
   - **B: Persistence** - This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It is not relevant to the initial opening of the executable file.
   - **C: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. It is not relevant to the initial opening of the executable file.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a system. When Susan opens the disguised executable file, the malicious code is executed, initiating the attack sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the execution of the malicious code occurs after the email is opened and the attachment is executed.

**Final Answer: D: Execution**
