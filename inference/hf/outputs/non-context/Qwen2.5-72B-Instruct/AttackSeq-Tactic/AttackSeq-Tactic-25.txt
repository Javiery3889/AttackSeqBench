### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an actor uses social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file, which then displays a decoy document and ultimately executes malware on the victim's machine.
   - The key actions are: social engineering, opening a .src file, displaying a decoy document, and executing malware.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. This typically happens after the initial compromise and execution of the malware. It is not the immediate next step after the target opens the file and the malware is executed.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to gain initial access to a system. The social engineering and opening of the .src file are part of the initial access phase, but the question is asking about what happens after the malware is executed.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves the execution of the malware on the victim's machine. The question states that the malware is executed after the target opens the .src file and the decoy document is displayed. Therefore, the execution of the malware is the immediate next step.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker's efforts to understand the environment they have compromised. This typically happens after the malware is executed and the attacker has gained a foothold in the system.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of actions described, the most plausible next step after the target opens the .src file, displays the decoy document, and the malware is executed is the **Execution** of the malware.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
