### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the adversary initially gains access through compromised VPN accounts.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the adversary engaging in discovery activities using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary gains access through compromised VPN accounts.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is typically a step that occurs before initial access. Since the question states that the adversary already has initial access through compromised VPN accounts, this is not the most likely next step.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target system and network. Using tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs is a clear example of discovery. This aligns well with the sequence described in the question.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. Since the adversary already has initial access, reconnaissance is not the next logical step.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the sequence described in the question.

### Final Reasoning
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access through compromised VPN accounts, the adversary would engage in discovery activities to gather more information about the target system and network.
- The use of tools like PsLogList to analyze Security Event logs is a clear example of the discovery tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Discovery
