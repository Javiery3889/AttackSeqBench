### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the VERMIN malware gained access through an SFX (Self-Extracting) executable.
   - The SFX executable displayed a decoy document and executed its payload.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial access.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The SFX executable is used to gain initial access to the system.
   - **Execution:** The payload is executed after the SFX executable is run.
   - **Decoy Document:** The SFX executable displays a decoy document to deceive the user.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution is the process of running the malicious payload. Since the SFX executable has already been run and the payload is executed, this is a plausible next step.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack chain, which has already occurred through the SFX executable. Therefore, this cannot be the next step.
   - **Answer Choice C: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within a network. This is a subsequent step that might occur after gaining initial access and executing the payload, but it is not the immediate next step.
   - **Answer Choice D: Impact**
     - Impact is the final stage where the attacker achieves their goal, such as data exfiltration or system destruction. This is not the immediate next step after gaining initial access and executing the payload.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after gaining initial access through the SFX executable and displaying the decoy document, the next step is the execution of the payload.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: A: Execution
