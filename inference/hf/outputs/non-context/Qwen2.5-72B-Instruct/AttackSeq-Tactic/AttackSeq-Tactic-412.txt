### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where threat actors:
     - Exploited CVE-2019-0604 in SharePoint to gain initial access.
     - Used webshells to maintain access.
     - Evaded detection by using a .NET loader with a custom Mimikatz variant.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2019-0604 in SharePoint.
   - **Persistence:** Using webshells to maintain access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using a .NET loader with a custom Mimikatz variant to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code, which is a common step after gaining initial access and before evading detection. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred **after** gaining initial access and **before** evading detection.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the sequence, where the threat actors exploit CVE-2019-0604. This does not fit the criteria of occurring after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as developing malware or creating accounts. This typically occurs before the initial access and does not fit the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a logical step after gaining initial access and before evading detection, as the threat actors would need to communicate with the compromised system to execute further actions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the threat actors established Command and Control after gaining initial access and before evading detection.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
