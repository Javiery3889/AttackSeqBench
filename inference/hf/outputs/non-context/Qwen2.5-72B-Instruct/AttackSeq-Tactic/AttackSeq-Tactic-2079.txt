### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Nemesis evades detection by executing components before the Windows OS fully loads and storing the malicious components in a custom virtual file system.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - Executing components before the Windows OS fully loads.
     - Storing malicious components in a custom virtual file system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Executing components before the Windows OS fully loads and storing them in a custom virtual file system are both methods to evade detection by security mechanisms.
   - **B: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. While storing components in a custom virtual file system could be a form of persistence, the primary focus here is on evading detection.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information from the system. The described TTPs do not directly relate to collecting information.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations. This is not directly related to the described TTPs.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Defense Evasion**. The techniques of executing components before the Windows OS fully loads and storing malicious components in a custom virtual file system are primarily aimed at evading detection.

**Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion**
