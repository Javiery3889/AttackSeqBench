### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where BBSRAT (a malware) has already communicated with a C2 (Command and Control) server using HTTP or HTTPS requests and has sent data about the victim’s machine via POST requests.
   - We need to determine the next logical ATT&CK tactic that would follow this communication.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. This typically happens before or during the initial communication with the C2 server, not after.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the attacker stealing and sending data from the victim’s machine to an external location. Since the question states that BBSRAT has already sent data about the victim’s machine via POST requests, this suggests that exfiltration has already occurred.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves the attacker maintaining control over the compromised system. The question already mentions that BBSRAT has communicated with the C2 server, so this tactic has already been established.
   - **D: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves the attacker trying to avoid detection and analysis. This can occur at various stages of the attack, but it is not the most logical next step after the initial communication and data exfiltration.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that BBSRAT has already communicated with the C2 server and sent data about the victim’s machine, the most logical next step would be for the attacker to continue the attack by exfiltrating more data or performing further actions. However, since the data exfiltration has already been mentioned, the next logical step would be for the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
