### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions performed by the Rising Sun implant.
   - The initial action is reconnaissance to gather system and network information.
   - The next action involves establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The initial gathering of system and network information.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing communication with control servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This choice aligns with the action of establishing communication with control servers using encrypted HTTP POST requests. The Command and Control tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
   - **Answer Choice B: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. However, it does not directly relate to the communication established after reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques used to gain information about the target network and systems. While the initial reconnaissance fits this category, the question specifically asks about the next step, which is establishing communication.
   - **Answer Choice D: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves techniques used to gain higher-level permissions on a system. It does not fit the context of establishing communication with control servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after reconnaissance, the next step is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
