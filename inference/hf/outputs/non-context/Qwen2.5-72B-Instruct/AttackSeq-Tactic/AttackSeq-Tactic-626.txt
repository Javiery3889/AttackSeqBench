### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have already established persistence within the target network and are preparing to exfiltrate collected data.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely enabled the attackers to maintain communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Established Persistence:** The attackers have already gained a foothold in the network and are maintaining their presence.
   - **Preceding Exfiltration:** The attackers are preparing to exfiltrate data.
   - **Maintain Communication and Control:** The attackers need to keep a channel open to control the compromised infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is not relevant to maintaining communication and control after persistence has been established.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network. While it is part of the attack sequence, it does not enable communication and control.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the methods and channels used by attackers to communicate with and control the compromised systems. It is directly relevant to maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the effects of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It is not relevant to maintaining communication and control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of maintaining communication and control over the compromised infrastructure, is **Command and Control (C2)**.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
