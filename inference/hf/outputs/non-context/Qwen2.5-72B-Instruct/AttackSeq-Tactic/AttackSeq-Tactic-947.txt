### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker uses obfuscation methods for macro scripts to deliver a backdoor payload.
   - The next step in the sequence is the backdoor communicating with a command and control (C2) server at `hxxp://outl00k[.]net` to send and receive further commands.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While obfuscation of macro scripts is a form of defense evasion, the question is asking about the communication with the C2 server, which is a different stage in the attack.
   - **B: Command and Control** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The communication with `hxxp://outl00k[.]net` to send and receive commands is a clear example of command and control.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges, so this is not relevant.
   - **D: Initial Access** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into a network. The initial access has already occurred with the delivery of the backdoor payload, so this is not the correct answer.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of events described in the question involves the backdoor payload being delivered and then communicating with a C2 server.
   - The communication with the C2 server to send and receive commands is a clear example of the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the backdoor began communicating with the C2 server as part of the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
