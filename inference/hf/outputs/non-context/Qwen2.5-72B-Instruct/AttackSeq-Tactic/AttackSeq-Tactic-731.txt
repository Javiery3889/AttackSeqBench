### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the deployment of a JavaScript backdoor to execute the CARBANAK RAT on the victim's machine.
   - The key elements are the deployment of a JavaScript backdoor and the execution of the CARBANAK RAT.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords. While this is a common early stage in many attacks, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for deploying a backdoor.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on a target system. This is a critical step in deploying a backdoor and executing the CARBANAK RAT.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing, drive-by downloads, or other methods to initially compromise a system. This is often a prerequisite for deploying a backdoor.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target before launching an attack. While important, it is not a direct prerequisite for deploying a backdoor.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The deployment of a JavaScript backdoor and the execution of the CARBANAK RAT are part of the Execution phase. However, before the backdoor can be deployed, the adversary must gain initial access to the system.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the Initial Access tactic occurred before the deployment of the backdoor and the execution of the CARBANAK RAT.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
