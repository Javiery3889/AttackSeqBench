### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor Machete.
   - Machete used standard FTP and HTTP ports to communicate with its command and control (C2) servers.
   - Machete also implemented fallback channels for document exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Communication with C2 servers using standard FTP and HTTP ports.
   - **Subsequent TTP:** Implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as account names and passwords. This does not align with the described sequence of using standard ports for C2 communication and implementing fallback channels for exfiltration.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. The question mentions the implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration, which directly aligns with the Exfiltration tactic.
   - **Answer Choice C: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. While using standard ports and fallback channels can be a form of defense evasion, the primary focus of the question is on the exfiltration of documents.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. The initial TTP described (using standard FTP and HTTP ports) is related to C2, but the question specifically asks about the next step after this initial communication.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical next step after establishing C2 communication and setting up fallback channels is the exfiltration of documents. The question explicitly mentions the implementation of fallback channels for document exfiltration, which is a clear indication of the Exfiltration tactic.

### Final Answer: B: Exfiltration
