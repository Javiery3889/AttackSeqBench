### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence starting with a PDF attachment used to gain initial access.
   - After gaining initial access, scripts and batch files were executed to prepare the attack environment.
   - Finally, persistence was ensured through registry modifications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a PDF attachment, which is a common method for gaining initial access.
   - **Execution:** Scripts and batch files are executed to prepare the attack environment.
   - **Persistence:** Registry modifications are made to ensure the attacker can maintain access over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - Impact is a tactic that involves actions taken to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This does not align with the sequence described, which focuses on gaining access, executing scripts, and ensuring persistence.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the sequence, but the question is asking about the tactic involved after gaining initial access.
   - **Answer Choice C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code, which aligns with the execution of scripts and batch files to prepare the attack environment.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to a system over time, which is the final step in the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described is:
     - Initial Access (PDF attachment)
     - Execution (scripts and batch files)
     - Persistence (registry modifications)

Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that involves the execution of scripts and batch files to prepare the attack environment.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
