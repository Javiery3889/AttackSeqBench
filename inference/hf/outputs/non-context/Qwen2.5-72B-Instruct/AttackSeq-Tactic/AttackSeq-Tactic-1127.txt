### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT42.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Using custom malware to log keystrokes and steal logins for privilege escalation.
     - Conducting internal reconnaissance by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Step:** Custom malware is used to log keystrokes and steal logins for privilege escalation.
   - **Final Step:** Internal reconnaissance is conducted by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves sending data out of the network. This is typically a later stage in the attack lifecycle, often after reconnaissance and data collection.
     - This does not fit well between privilege escalation and internal reconnaissance.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense evasion involves techniques to avoid detection. While this can occur at various stages, it is not specifically tied to the sequence described.
     - This is less likely to be the correct answer.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial access involves gaining entry into the network. This is typically the first step in an attack, not something that occurs after privilege escalation.
     - This does not fit the sequence.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential access involves techniques to obtain credentials, which can be used for privilege escalation and further movement within the network.
     - This fits well between the use of custom malware to steal logins and the subsequent internal reconnaissance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     - Custom malware is used to log keystrokes and steal logins (privilege escalation).
     - Credential access is performed to obtain additional credentials.
     - Internal reconnaissance is conducted using the obtained credentials.

### Final Answer: D: Credential Access
