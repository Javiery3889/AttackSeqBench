### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where attackers establish communication with C2 servers using hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files to control KernelBot implants.
   - The next step is that these bots are directed to target Next Media websites, resulting in a 'total failure' of their network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing communication with C2 servers using hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files.
   - **Subsequent TTPs:**
     - **Impact:** The bots are directed to target Next Media websites, leading to a 'total failure' of their network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to systems over extended periods. While persistence is important, it does not directly describe the 'total failure' of the network.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves manipulating, interrupting, or destroying systems and data to achieve the attacker's goals. The 'total failure' of the network aligns with the impact tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While defense evasion is crucial, it does not directly describe the 'total failure' of the network.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with systems under the attacker's control. While it is part of the initial setup, it does not describe the 'total failure' of the network.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Communication:**
   - The attackers establish communication with C2 servers using hardcoded and XOR-encoded configuration files. This is a clear example of the **Command and Control** tactic.

2. **Targeting and Impact:**
   - The bots are then directed to target Next Media websites, resulting in a 'total failure' of their network. This indicates a significant disruption or destruction of the network, which aligns with the **Impact** tactic.

### Final Answer

Final Answer: B: Impact
