### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT28 uses the Komplex Binder to deliver a dropper.
   - The dropper is saved on the system.
   - A decoy PDF file is opened to initiate the attack.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the attacker gains entry into the system. In this case, the Komplex Binder is used to deliver the dropper, which is a method of initial access.
   - **Execution:** After the dropper is saved on the system, the next logical step is to execute the dropper. Opening the decoy PDF file to initiate the attack is a form of execution.
   - **Collection:** This involves gathering data from the system, which typically happens after the attacker has established a foothold and executed their payload.
   - **Lateral Movement:** This involves moving from one system to another within the network, which is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access (A):** This is the initial step where the dropper is delivered, but the question is asking what happens after this step.
   - **Execution (B):** This is the next logical step after the dropper is saved on the system. Opening the decoy PDF file to initiate the attack is a clear example of execution.
   - **Collection (C):** This would occur after the dropper has been executed and the attacker has established a foothold, which is not the immediate next step.
   - **Lateral Movement (D):** This would occur after the attacker has already executed the dropper and possibly collected some initial data, which is not the immediate next step.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
