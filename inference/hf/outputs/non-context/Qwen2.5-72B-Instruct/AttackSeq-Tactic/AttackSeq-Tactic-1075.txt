### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers used the SLUB backdoor to perform discovery tasks, such as downloading GitHub snippets for command parsing and retrieving the username and computer name.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely followed next in the attack sequence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTPs:**
     - **Backdoor Utilization:** The attackers used the SLUB backdoor.
     - **Discovery:** Downloading GitHub snippets for command parsing and retrieving the username and computer name.
   - **Next Tactic:**
     - The question asks for the next tactic in the sequence.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate next step after discovery.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is a plausible next step after discovery, but it is not the most immediate or necessary next step.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. After performing discovery tasks, establishing a more robust C2 channel is a logical next step to maintain control and issue further commands.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the target network. While this is a common next step, it typically follows after establishing a more robust C2 channel.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After performing discovery tasks, the most logical next step is to establish a more robust Command and Control (C2) channel. This allows the attackers to maintain control and issue further commands, which is essential for any subsequent actions like lateral movement or data collection.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Command and Control
