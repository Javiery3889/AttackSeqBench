### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 were sent to officials at Indian embassies.
   - These documents led to the dropping of the svchost.exe downloader.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with the weaponized RTF documents being sent to the officials. This is a common method for gaining initial access to a target system.
   - **Exploitation:** The RTF documents exploit CVE-2012-0158, which is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
   - **Execution:** The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the execution of the svchost.exe downloader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is the most plausible next step after the initial access and exploitation. The svchost.exe downloader is executed to further the attack.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral movement typically occurs after the attacker has gained a foothold in the network and is looking to spread to other systems. This is not the immediate next step after the initial access and exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial access has already occurred with the sending of the weaponized RTF documents. This is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **Answer Choice D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is typically a pre-attack phase where the attacker gathers information about the target. This is not the next step after the initial access and exploitation.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Execution
