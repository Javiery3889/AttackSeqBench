### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor "Earth Wendigo."
   - The actions include establishing a WebSocket connection to control a JavaScript backdoor and reading emails from the webmail server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Establishing a WebSocket connection to control a JavaScript backdoor:** This is part of the **Command and Control (C2)** tactic, where the attacker maintains communication with the compromised system.
   - **Reading emails from the webmail server:** This action involves accessing and potentially collecting sensitive information, which is a precursor to exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control:** This is already part of the initial sequence where the WebSocket connection is established.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not relevant to the sequence described.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to access additional systems. The question does not mention any movement to other systems.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing and transferring data out of the compromised network. Reading emails from the webmail server is a step that typically precedes exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves establishing control (Command and Control) and then accessing sensitive information (reading emails). The next logical step in the attack sequence would be to exfiltrate the data.

### Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
