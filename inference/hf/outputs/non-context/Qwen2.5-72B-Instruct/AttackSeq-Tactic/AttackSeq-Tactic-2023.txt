### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where an attacker has achieved defense evasion by running the SOCKSBOT implant entirely in memory via the `svchost.exe` process.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attacker has already achieved this by running the implant in memory.
   - **Next Step:** The question asks about the next tactic that enables interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it is a common next step after initial access, it does not directly relate to the interaction with attackers through HTTP status codes and socket communications.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic has already been achieved in the described sequence, so it is not the next step.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications is a key aspect of C2, as it allows the attacker to send commands and receive data from the compromised system.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the attack. While it is a later stage in the attack lifecycle, it does not directly relate to the communication methods described.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step in the attack sequence, given the interaction with attackers through specific HTTP status codes and socket communications, is **Command and Control (C2)**.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
