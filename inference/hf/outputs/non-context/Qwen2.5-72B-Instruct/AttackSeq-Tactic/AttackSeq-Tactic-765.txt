### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes the Darkhotel APT group's attack sequence.
   - The sequence starts with gaining initial access by deploying malware disguised as legitimate software updates for hotel guests.
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay, before the initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure, creating malware, and gathering tools. It does not specifically involve gathering information about victims' whereabouts.
   - **B: Reconnaissance**: This tactic involves gathering information about the target, including their locations, names, and other relevant details. This is the most likely candidate for obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts.
   - **C: Initial Access**: This tactic involves the actual methods used to gain access to the target's systems, such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using malware. It occurs after the reconnaissance phase.
   - **D: Command and Control**: This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems. It occurs after initial access has been gained.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The Darkhotel APT group needed to know where their targets were staying (e.g., in which hotels) and who they were (e.g., their names) before they could deploy malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - The process of gathering this information about the victims' whereabouts and identities is a clear example of the **Reconnaissance** tactic.
   - The other answer choices do not fit as well because they either occur after the initial access (Command and Control, Initial Access) or are not specifically about gathering information about the victims (Resource Development).

**Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance**
