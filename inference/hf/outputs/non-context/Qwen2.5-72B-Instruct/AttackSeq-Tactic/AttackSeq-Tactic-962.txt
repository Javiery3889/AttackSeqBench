### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving a malicious file named `System.doc` that executed as `TONEDEAF` to establish communication with a C2 (Command and Control) server.
   - The sequence then mentions that FireEye's ExploitGuard detected and prevented an anomaly caused by Microsoft Excel.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Execution of the malicious file `System.doc`.
   - **Tactic:** `TONEDEAF` (a technique for establishing C2 communication).
   - **Detection:** FireEye's ExploitGuard detected and prevented an anomaly caused by Microsoft Excel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. While persistence is a common goal, it typically occurs after initial access and C2 communication are established. It doesn't fit well with the immediate detection and prevention of an anomaly.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. It usually occurs before the initial compromise and is not directly related to the detection of an anomaly.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. While impact can occur after C2 communication, it is not typically the immediate next step after establishing C2 and before detection.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Given that the question mentions the detection and prevention of an anomaly, it is likely that the attacker was attempting to evade defenses, which led to the detection.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Execution and C2 Communication:**
   - The malicious file `System.doc` executed and used `TONEDEAF` to establish communication with the C2 server. This is the initial compromise and C2 establishment phase.

2. **Detection and Prevention:**
   - FireEye's ExploitGuard detected and prevented an anomaly caused by Microsoft Excel. This suggests that the attacker was attempting to perform actions that were detected and blocked by the security software.

3. **Most Likely Tactic Before Detection:**
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred before the detection and prevention of the anomaly is **Defense Evasion**. The attacker was likely using techniques to avoid detection, which led to the anomaly being noticed and blocked by ExploitGuard.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion
