### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence involving ShadowPad, a malware known for its sophisticated techniques.
   - The initial deployment involves DLL sideloading in a legitimate executable.
   - The execution includes custom decryption algorithms and payload injection.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic ensures the malware remains active even after system restarts or interruptions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection** - This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which is not related to ensuring the malware remains active after system restarts.
   - **B: Impact** - This tactic involves degrading or disrupting system availability, which is not related to maintaining the malware's presence.
   - **C: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code, which is part of the initial deployment but does not ensure persistence.
   - **D: Persistence** - This tactic involves techniques that ensure the malware remains active even after system restarts or interruptions. This is the most relevant tactic for the question.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial deployment and execution of ShadowPad involve techniques like DLL sideloading and payload injection.
   - To ensure the malware remains active after system restarts or interruptions, the attacker would need to use persistence techniques.
   - Persistence techniques can include creating registry keys, scheduled tasks, or modifying system files to ensure the malware is re-executed upon system startup.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
