### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT, the downloading of a malware configuration file, and the exfiltration of data using the SmartFTP Client.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT and the exfiltration of data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The deployment of the CARBANAK RAT.
   - **Malware Configuration File Download:** The downloading of "anunak_config."
   - **Exfiltration:** The use of the SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Exfiltration:** This is the final step in the sequence, so it cannot be the tactic that occurred between the deployment of the RAT and the exfiltration.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the tactic that occurred between the deployment of the RAT and the exfiltration.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. It is a logical step after gaining initial access and before exfiltration, as the attacker needs to know what data to exfiltrate.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It is also a logical step after gaining initial access and before exfiltration, as the attacker needs to control the system to download the configuration file and prepare for exfiltration.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - **Initial Access (B):** Deployment of the CARBANAK RAT.
   - **Command and Control (D):** Downloading the malware configuration file "anunak_config" to establish control.
   - **Exfiltration (A):** Using the SmartFTP Client to exfiltrate data.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
