### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts, such as cookie stealers and webmail session key manipulators, leading to the injection of persistent JavaScript through XSS vulnerabilities.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of these scripts.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target system. This typically happens after gaining access and executing initial scripts.
     - This is less likely to be the tactic that occurred before the execution of malicious scripts.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. This is the step where the malicious scripts are actually run.
     - This is the step described in the question, not the one that occurred before it.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining entry to the target system. This is a prerequisite for executing any malicious scripts.
     - This is a strong candidate because the attacker must gain initial access before they can execute scripts.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This typically happens after gaining initial access and executing scripts.
     - This is less likely to be the tactic that occurred before the execution of malicious scripts.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gained Initial Access to the system before executing the malicious scripts.

**Final Answer: C: Initial Access**
