### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have been persistently collecting credentials and preparing them for transmission every hour.
   - The next step in the sequence is the establishment of a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection:** The attackers are collecting credentials.
   - **Preparation for Transmission:** The credentials are being prepared for transmission.
   - **Upload to External FTP Server:** The credentials are being uploaded to an external FTP server.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. While this might be relevant earlier in the attack lifecycle, it does not fit the context of uploading stolen credentials.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system. While the attackers are collecting credentials, this choice does not describe the act of uploading the credentials.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is not relevant to the act of uploading stolen credentials.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the compromised system to control it and exfiltrate data. Establishing a mechanism to upload stolen credentials to an external FTP server is a form of data exfiltration, which is a key aspect of the C2 tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the establishment of a mechanism to upload stolen credentials to an external FTP server, which aligns with the **Command and Control** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
