### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs involving the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
   - The sequence includes:
     - Establishing persistence through service and run key installations.
     - Communicating with C2 servers using domains such as pressmil[.]com.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This typically occurs after initial access and persistence have been established, but it is not necessarily a required step before C2 communication.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. This can occur at various stages of the attack, including before and after persistence and C2 communication.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence is already mentioned in the question as part of the initial steps (service and run key installations). Therefore, this cannot be the answer as it is not a subsequent step.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. This is a logical next step after persistence has been established, as the attacker needs to communicate with the compromised system to issue commands and receive data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attacker established persistence and then communicated with C2 servers. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after persistence and before C2 communication is not a separate step but rather the C2 communication itself.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
