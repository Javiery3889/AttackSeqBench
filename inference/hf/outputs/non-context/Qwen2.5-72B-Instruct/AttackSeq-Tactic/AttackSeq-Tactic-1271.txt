### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the threat group TG1021.
   - The sequence is: 
     1. Interfering with logging mechanisms to evade detection.
     2. Using publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Tactic 1: Evasion** (Interfering with logging mechanisms to evade detection)
   - **Tactic 2: Discovery** (Using SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance)

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over compromised systems. It typically occurs after initial access and is used to communicate with the compromised system. However, it does not fit well between evading detection and performing reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems or accounts. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it does not logically fit between evading detection and performing reconnaissance.
   - **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user accounts. Using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Persistence**
     - This tactic involves maintaining long-term access to a system. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically occurs after the initial reconnaissance and exploitation phases.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred after TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection and before using SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
