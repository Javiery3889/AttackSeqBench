### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts.
   - The key elements are:
     - Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and other hacktools.
     - The infection of internal hosts.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on a victim's system. This is a step that typically occurs after gaining initial access to the system.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves communicating with the compromised system to control it. This is a step that typically occurs after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold on the victim's network. This is the first step in the attack chain and is necessary before any other actions can be taken.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the victim's network and systems. This is a step that typically occurs after gaining initial access to understand the environment better.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of the Nidiran back door and other hacktools to infect internal hosts suggests that the attackers already have a foothold in the network.
   - Before using these tools, the attackers must have gained initial access to the network.
   - Therefore, the most logical sequence is that the attackers first gained initial access, then used the back door and other tools to infect internal hosts.

### Final Answer: C: Initial Access
