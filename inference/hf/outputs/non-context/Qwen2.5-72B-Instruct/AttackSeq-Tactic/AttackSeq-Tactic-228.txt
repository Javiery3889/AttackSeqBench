### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through exploiting the CVE-2017-0262 vulnerability in malicious attachments.
   - After gaining initial access, the malware established communication at five-second intervals with a compromised server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with gaining initial access through the CVE-2017-0262 vulnerability.
   - **Establishing Communication:** The malware then establishes communication with a compromised server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, but it does not describe the communication established after gaining access.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system, which is not mentioned in the question.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the malware establishing communication with a server to receive commands and exfiltrate data, which aligns with the described behavior of the malware.
   - **D: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware on the victim's system, which is part of the initial access phase but does not describe the communication established afterward.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
