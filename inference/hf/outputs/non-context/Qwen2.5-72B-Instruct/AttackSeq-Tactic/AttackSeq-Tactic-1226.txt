### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by APT10.
   - The sequence starts with Initial Access via DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe.
   - The sequence ends with establishing persistence using service installation and Run registry key.
   - We need to determine the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 gains access using DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 establishes persistence using service installation and Run registry key.
   - The question asks what likely happened in between these two steps.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves data destruction, manipulation, or denial of service, which typically occurs later in the attack lifecycle, not immediately after gaining initial access.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which is a logical next step after gaining initial access. It is necessary to execute additional payloads or tools to further the attack.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. While it can occur early in the attack, it is not typically the immediate next step after gaining initial access.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker would likely need to execute additional code to further the attack and prepare for establishing persistence.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that occurred between gaining initial access and establishing persistence is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
