### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the initial access was gained through spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits.
   - The next step in the sequence involves the deployment of modules for lateral movement, which includes scanning for vulnerable hosts or using admin credentials.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits.
   - **Next Step:** Deployment of modules for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the most likely immediate next step after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves techniques to move through a network to expand the attacker's control. Given that the question specifically mentions deploying modules for lateral movement, this is a strong candidate.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques to steal data from the network. It is typically a later step in the attack sequence, not immediately after gaining initial access and before lateral movement.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques to gain higher-level permissions. While it is often necessary before lateral movement, the question does not explicitly mention privilege escalation as a step between initial access and lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was gained through spear phishing with customized documents containing exploits.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence is to prepare for and execute lateral movement.
   - Lateral movement involves techniques to move through the network, which aligns with the deployment of modules for scanning vulnerable hosts or using admin credentials.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
