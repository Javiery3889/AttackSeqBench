### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first evade security measures using `ZwWriteVirtualMemory` and `ZwCreateSection` to manipulate memory and processes.
   - After evading security, the adversaries establish command and control (C2) by transmitting data over HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the victim's system. This could happen after gaining initial access and evading security measures, but it is not necessarily a required step before establishing C2.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves adversaries gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment. This is a common step after gaining access and evading security measures, and before establishing C2 to ensure they know how to communicate back to their command server.
   - **C: Command and Control**
     - This is the tactic that occurs after the adversaries have established communication with their command server. It cannot be the answer because the question states that C2 is established after the evasion and before the tactic we are looking for.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the victim's system. This typically happens early in the attack, often as part of the initial access or as a follow-up to gaining access. It is not a logical step to occur after evasion and before C2.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurs after evading security measures and before establishing C2 is **Discovery**. This is because adversaries need to understand the environment to effectively establish C2.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
