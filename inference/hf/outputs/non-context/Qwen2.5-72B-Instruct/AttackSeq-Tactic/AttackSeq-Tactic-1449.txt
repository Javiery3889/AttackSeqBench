### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in an attack.
   - The sequence mentioned is: 
     1. SkinnyBoy created a new process to run system commands.
     2. SkinnyBoy enumerated files and directories to gather system information.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not fit between creating a new process and enumerating files and directories.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be relevant, it is not the most likely tactic to occur between creating a new process and enumerating files and directories.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves the techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code. Creating a new process to run system commands is an execution technique. However, the question is asking for what happens after this step.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. This is typically a later stage in an attack and does not fit between creating a new process and enumerating files and directories.

3. **Determine the Most Plausible Tactic:**
   - The most plausible tactic that fits between creating a new process to run system commands and enumerating files and directories is **Discovery**. Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network.
   - However, since "Discovery" is not one of the answer choices, we need to find the closest match. The closest match in the given choices is **Execution** because the enumeration of files and directories can be considered a form of execution of commands to gather information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Execution
