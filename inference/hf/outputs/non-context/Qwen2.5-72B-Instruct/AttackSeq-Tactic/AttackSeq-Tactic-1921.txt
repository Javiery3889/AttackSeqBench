### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers first entice victims to download malicious applications to gain initial access.
   - The next step in the sequence is sending stolen data back to the command and control (C2) servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between gaining initial access and sending stolen data.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gain access to the victim's system by enticing them to download malicious applications.
   - **Sending Stolen Data:** The attackers send stolen data back to their C2 servers.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not directly related to the process of sending stolen data back to the C2 servers.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the sequence, not the step that occurs before sending stolen data.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While it is a necessary step after gaining initial access, it is not the step that directly precedes sending stolen data.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. This is a logical step that would occur before sending stolen data back to the C2 servers.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain access to the victim's system.
     2. **Execution:** Run malicious code.
     3. **Collection:** Gather data of interest.
     4. **Command and Control (C2):** Send stolen data back to the C2 servers.

### Final Answer: D: Collection
