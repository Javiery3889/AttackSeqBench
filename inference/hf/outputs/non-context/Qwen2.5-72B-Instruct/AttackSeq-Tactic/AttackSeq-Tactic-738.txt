### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attacker has already exfiltrated data using the SmartFTP Client connected to an attacker-controlled IP address.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** the exfiltration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question includes:
     - Exfiltration (using SmartFTP Client to an attacker-controlled IP address).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access is typically an earlier stage in the attack lifecycle, where the attacker attempts to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. This is unlikely to occur after exfiltration.
   - **B: Impact**
     - Impact involves actions that disrupt the availability or integrity of systems and data. This could occur after exfiltration, as the attacker might want to cover their tracks or cause further damage.
   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of stealing and transferring data out of the target network. Since the question states that exfiltration has already occurred, this cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before the attack. This is typically an early stage and would not occur after exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the exfiltration has already occurred, the most plausible next step would be to cause further damage or cover tracks, which aligns with the **Impact** tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Impact
