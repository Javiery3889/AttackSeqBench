### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the TeamTNT threat group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Downloading and executing a coin miner payload.
     2. Tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Downloading and executing a coin miner payload.
     - This falls under the **Execution** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org.
     - This involves monitoring and maintaining access to the infected hosts, which is typically associated with **Command and Control** (C2) activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is the initial action of downloading and executing the coin miner payload, but it does not fit the sequence after the initial execution.
   - **Answer Choice B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network, which is not directly related to tracking infected hosts.
   - **Answer Choice C: Command and Control**
     - This fits the sequence after the initial execution of the coin miner payload. Tracking infected hosts using iplogger.org is a form of maintaining command and control over the compromised systems.
   - **Answer Choice D: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the theft of data from the compromised system, which is not mentioned in the sequence described.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the coin miner payload is executed, the next step is to maintain command and control over the infected hosts.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
