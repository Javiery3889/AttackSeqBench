### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where the 'Energetic Bear' group compromised a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack in a watering hole campaign.
   - The next step involves harvesting credentials via a modified image URL that redirects to a file protocol.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise of the website through a supply chain attack in a watering hole campaign.
   - **Next Step:** Harvesting credentials via a modified image URL redirecting to a file protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not directly related to harvesting credentials from a modified image URL.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already covered by the initial compromise through the supply chain attack in the watering hole campaign.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which aligns with the described action of harvesting credentials via a modified image URL.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves techniques to steal data, which is not the immediate next step after harvesting credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved through a supply chain attack in a watering hole campaign.
   - The next logical step in the attack sequence is to harvest credentials, which is a common follow-up action to gain further access or to use the harvested credentials for other purposes.
   - The modified image URL redirecting to a file protocol is a technique used to trick users into revealing their credentials, which falls under the **Credential Access** tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
