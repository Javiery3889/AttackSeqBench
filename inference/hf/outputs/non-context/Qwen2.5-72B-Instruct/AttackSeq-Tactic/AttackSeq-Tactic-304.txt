### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries first gather information through social engineering techniques (phishing and supply chain targeting).
   - After gathering information, they exploit vulnerabilities in MongoDB databases and Citrix systems to gain access.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Stage:** Gathering information through social engineering (phishing and supply chain targeting).
   - **Final Stage:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in MongoDB databases and Citrix systems to gain access.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target. This is the initial stage described in the question, so it does not fit between the two stages.
   - **B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining a foothold in the target's environment. This is the final stage described in the question, so it does not fit between the two stages.
   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources to support the attack, such as developing or acquiring tools, establishing infrastructure, and creating accounts. This fits well between gathering information and gaining access, as it is a logical step to prepare for the exploitation phase.
   - **D: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to the target's environment. This typically occurs after gaining initial access, so it does not fit between the two stages.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Reconnaissance** (gathering information through social engineering).
     2. **Resource Development** (preparing the necessary resources).
     3. **Initial Access** (exploiting vulnerabilities in MongoDB databases and Citrix systems).

### Final Answer: C: Resource Development
