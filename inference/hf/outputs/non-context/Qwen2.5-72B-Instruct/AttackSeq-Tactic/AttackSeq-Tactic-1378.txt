### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
   - The sequence includes: using web services and JSP tools to steal targeted data, using proxies, and encoding data for command and control.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before these actions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Stealing targeted data using web services and JSP tools:** This is part of the **Exfiltration** tactic.
   - **Using proxies:** This is part of the **Command and Control** tactic.
   - **Encoding data for command and control:** This is also part of the **Command and Control** tactic.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves gathering and preparing resources needed for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating malware. It typically occurs before the actual attack begins.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with compromised systems to control them. It is a critical part of the attack but not necessarily the first step.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the target. It is a later step in the attack sequence, after the attacker has gained access and established command and control.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. It is typically one of the first steps in the attack sequence.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves exfiltration and command and control, which are later stages of the attack.
   - Before these actions, the attacker would need to gather information about the target and set up the necessary resources.
   - **Reconnaissance** is the most logical first step, as it provides the necessary information to plan and execute the attack.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
