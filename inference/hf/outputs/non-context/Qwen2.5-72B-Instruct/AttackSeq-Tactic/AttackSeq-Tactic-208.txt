### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions in a Bandook campaign.
   - The actions include executing PowerShell scripts to decode malware components and assembling the final payload.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the injection of the malicious payload using Process Hollowing.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Execution of PowerShell scripts:** This is part of the **Execution** tactic, where the attacker runs scripts to decode and assemble the payload.
   - **Assembling the final payload:** This is also part of the **Execution** tactic, as it involves preparing the malware to run.
   - **Process Hollowing:** This is a technique used for **Defense Evasion** to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic includes techniques like Process Hollowing, which is mentioned in the question. However, the question asks what happened before Process Hollowing.
   - **B: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It is not directly related to the execution of scripts or payload assembly.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code, which aligns with the execution of PowerShell scripts and assembling the payload. This is the step that occurs before the Defense Evasion technique of Process Hollowing.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the target system, which is not relevant to the sequence described in the question.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the **Execution** of PowerShell scripts and payload assembly occurred before the **Defense Evasion** technique of Process Hollowing.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
