### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attacker first exploits Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
   - The next step involves the Remote shell module communicating with a C&C (Command and Control) server for additional actions.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be a part of the attack, it doesn't directly describe the communication with a C&C server.
   - **B: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from a network. The question does not mention data exfiltration, so this is not the most likely next step.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions. The question already mentions that Privilege Escalation has been completed, so this is not the next step.
   - **D: Command and Control** - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The question specifically mentions the Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The attack sequence starts with Privilege Escalation to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
   - After gaining these capabilities, the next logical step is to establish communication with a C&C server to receive further instructions or commands.
   - The Remote shell module communicating with a C&C server is a clear indication of the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
