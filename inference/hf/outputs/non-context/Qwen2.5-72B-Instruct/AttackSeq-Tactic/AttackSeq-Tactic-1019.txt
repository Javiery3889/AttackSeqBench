### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where the SBDH malware contacts a remote server to download additional components (backdoor and data stealer) for remote control and data exfiltration.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic likely occurred before this step.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The malware has already been deployed and is now contacting a remote server.
   - This indicates that the malware has already gained initial access to the system and is now in the process of establishing command and control.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:**
     - Execution is the tactic where the adversary runs the malware on the victim's system. This typically happens after initial access.
     - However, the question implies that the malware is already running and is now contacting a remote server, so this is not the most likely previous step.
   - **B: Command and Control:**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic where the adversary communicates with the compromised system to control it.
     - The malware contacting a remote server to download additional components is a clear indication of C2, but this is the current step, not the previous one.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement is the tactic where the adversary moves through the network to access other systems.
     - This is not relevant to the initial deployment and communication with a remote server.
   - **D: Initial Access:**
     - Initial Access is the tactic where the adversary gains the initial foothold on the victim's system.
     - Before the malware can contact a remote server, it must first gain access to the system. This is the most logical previous step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the malware gained initial access to the system before it contacted the remote server to download additional components.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
