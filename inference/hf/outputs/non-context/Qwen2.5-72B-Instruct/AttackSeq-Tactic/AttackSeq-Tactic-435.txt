### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving an obfuscated VBScript (VBS) named 'PlayList.vbs' that is executed using 'wscript.exe'.
   - The script is deleted before communicating with the C2 server to evade detection.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Execution of the obfuscated VBS script using 'wscript.exe'.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Deletion of the VBS script to evade detection.
   - **Final Action:** Communication with the C2 server (not part of the question but mentioned as a future step).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to a system over time. It is not relevant to the deletion of a script to evade detection.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security tools and processes. Deleting a script to prevent it from being discovered aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not relevant to the deletion of a script to evade detection.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials. It is not relevant to the deletion of a script to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The question specifically mentions the deletion of the VBS script to evade detection.
   - Deleting a script to prevent it from being discovered is a common technique used in defense evasion.
   - The other answer choices (Persistence, Lateral Movement, and Credential Access) do not align with the described action of deleting a script to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
