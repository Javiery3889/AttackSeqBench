### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) binary objects were used to target high-ranking diplomats and academic researchers.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Spear Phishing:** A targeted phishing attack.
     - **Infected Document Files with OLE Objects:** Malicious documents that can execute code when opened.
     - **High-Ranking Diplomats and Academic Researchers:** The targets of the attack.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate next step after the initial spear phishing.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information to plan future actions. Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial access, not after.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. Given that the spear phishing emails contain infected documents with OLE objects, the next logical step after the target opens the document is the execution of the malicious code.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. The spear phishing emails are part of the initial access phase, so this is not the next step after the initial access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the spear phishing emails are opened, the next step is the execution of the malicious code contained in the infected document files with OLE objects.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
