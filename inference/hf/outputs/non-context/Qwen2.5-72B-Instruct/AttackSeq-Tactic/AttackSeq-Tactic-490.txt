### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by the Pierogi backdoor.
   - The backdoor first collected system information during the Discovery phase.
   - After the Discovery phase, the backdoor utilized its capabilities to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The backdoor collected system information.
   - **Next Phase:** The backdoor took screenshots and executed arbitrary commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the adversary's ability to communicate with the compromised system. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it does not directly describe the actions of taking screenshots or executing commands.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to understand the environment. The question already states that the Discovery phase has been completed, so this is not the next phase.
   - **C: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This is not relevant to the actions of taking screenshots or executing commands.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves the adversary's efforts to gather data from the compromised system. Taking screenshots and executing commands to collect information aligns well with the Collection tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after the Discovery phase, the backdoor moved to the Collection phase to take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands.

**Final Answer: D: Collection**
