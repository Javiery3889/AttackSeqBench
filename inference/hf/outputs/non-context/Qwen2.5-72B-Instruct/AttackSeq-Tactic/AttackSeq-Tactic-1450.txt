### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where data is collected by base64 encoding outputs.
   - It then mentions that SkinnyBoy used `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` to retrieve file directories and user-specific details.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Base64 Encoding Outputs:** This is part of the **Collection** tactic, where data is prepared for exfiltration.
   - **FindFirstFileW and GetUserNameA:** These are used to discover file directories and user-specific details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they are operating in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user details. Using `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` to retrieve file directories and user-specific details aligns with the Discovery tactic.
   - **B: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the adversary. While base64 encoding outputs is part of Collection, the use of `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` is more aligned with Discovery.
   - **C: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to identify and capture credentials. The use of `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` does not directly align with credential access.
   - **D: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The use of `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` does not align with Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred before the Collection tactic. The use of `FindFirstFileW` and `GetUserNameA` to retrieve file directories and user-specific details is a clear indicator of the Discovery tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
