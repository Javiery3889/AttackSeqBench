### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Deep Panda's Milestone backdoor has already established communication with its C2 (Command and Control) server and has sent information about current sessions on the system.
   - We need to determine the next logical step in the attack sequence.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves the adversary establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. However, the question states that the backdoor has already established communication with the C2 server, so this step has already occurred.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the adversary gathering information about the system and network to understand the environment better. After establishing communication with the C2 server and sending information about current sessions, the next logical step would be to discover more about the system and network to plan further actions.
   - **C: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves the adversary moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network. While this is a common next step, it typically follows a period of discovery to identify potential targets.
   - **D: Exfiltration**
     - This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the compromised system and sending it to an external location. While this is a common goal, it usually follows a period of discovery and possibly lateral movement to gather the necessary data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible next step after establishing communication with the C2 server and sending information about current sessions is to perform discovery to gather more information about the system and network.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
