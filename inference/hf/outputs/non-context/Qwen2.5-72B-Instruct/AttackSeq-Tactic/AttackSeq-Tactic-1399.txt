### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where TA413 delivered a phishing email.
   - The phishing email led to a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' landing page.
   - The landing page was used to profile the user's system.
   - The profiling was done to determine the delivery of the FriarFox browser extension.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The phishing email is the initial method used to gain access to the user's system.
   - **Discovery:** Profiling the user's system to determine the delivery of the FriarFox browser extension involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the Discovery tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic is already part of the sequence (phishing email), but it is the first step, not what happens after the landing page.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system, which aligns with the profiling described in the question.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which is not mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the Discovery tactic occurred after the initial access via the phishing email and the landing page.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
