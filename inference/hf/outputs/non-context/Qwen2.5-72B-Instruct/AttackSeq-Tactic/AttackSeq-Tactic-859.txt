### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where TA505 uses nefarious macros in malicious MS Office documents to download payloads.
   - After this, they achieve persistence by adding a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows Registry Run key.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the initial entry point where the attacker uses nefarious macros in malicious MS Office documents to gain access to the system.
   - **Execution:** This is the next step where the macros execute and download payloads.
   - **Persistence:** This is the final step where the attacker adds a 'Microtik' string value to the Windows Registry Run key to ensure the malware runs every time the system starts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Execution**
     - This is the most likely tactic that occurred after the initial access and before persistence. The macros are used to execute the download of payloads, which is a clear example of the Execution tactic.
   - **Answer Choice B: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the system, which is not mentioned in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice C: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sequence described.
   - **Answer Choice D: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is already covered by the use of nefarious macros in malicious MS Office documents, so it cannot be the answer for the step between execution and persistence.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A: Execution
