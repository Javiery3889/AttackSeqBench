### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- **Question Context**: The Hellsing APT group used spear-phishing documents with CVE-2012-0158 exploits to gain initial access to the target systems.
- **Key Event**: After gaining access, the backdoor connected to a server (philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com) to perform actions like uploading and downloading files.

### Step 2: Compare and Evaluate
- **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
  - **Reasoning**: Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This includes spear-phishing, which was used to gain the initial access. However, the question is asking about the next step after gaining access, which is not Initial Access.

- **Answer Choice B: Command and Control (C2)**
  - **Reasoning**: Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The backdoor connecting to a server to upload and download files is a clear example of C2 activity. This is the most likely tactic given the context.

- **Answer Choice C: Discovery**
  - **Reasoning**: Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While this is a crucial step in an attack, the question specifically mentions the backdoor connecting to a server to perform file operations, which is more aligned with C2.

- **Answer Choice D: Lateral Movement**
  - **Reasoning**: Lateral Movement involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. While this is a common next step after gaining initial access, the question does not mention any movement to other systems, only the connection to a server for file operations.

### Step 3: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The Hellsing APT group used spear-phishing to gain initial access.
- **Step 2**: After gaining access, the backdoor connected to a server to upload and download files.
- **Step 3**: The connection to a server for file operations is a clear example of Command and Control (C2) activity.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
