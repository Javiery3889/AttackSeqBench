### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by Emissary Panda, a threat actor group.
   - The sequence includes installing webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - The next step involves using tools like Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Persistence:** Installing webshells on SharePoint servers.
   - **Pivoting:** Using tools like Mimikatz to move laterally within the network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that allow an adversary to obtain credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to use for further actions. Mimikatz is a well-known tool for credential dumping, which is a sub-technique under Credential Access.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this is a crucial part of many attacks, it is not the most likely step immediately before pivoting.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information about the target before or during an attack. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs earlier in the attack lifecycle.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery is important for understanding the environment, it is not the most likely step immediately before pivoting with Mimikatz.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The use of Mimikatz to pivot to additional systems within the network is a clear indication of the **Credential Access** tactic. Mimikatz is specifically designed to extract credentials, which are then used to move laterally within the network.

### Final Answer: A: Credential Access
