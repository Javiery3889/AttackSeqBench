### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that enabled attackers to compromise Avast's download servers and embed a malicious binary in software accessed by users.
   - The sequence of events described involves the attackers gaining access to the download servers and then embedding the malicious binary.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. It is not relevant to the initial compromise of the download servers.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves the attacker running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is part of the attack sequence, it does not describe how the attackers initially gained access to the download servers.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves the attacker moving from one system to another within a network. It is not relevant to the initial compromise of the download servers.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the attacker gaining the initial foothold in the network or system. This is the most relevant tactic for the scenario described, as it explains how the attackers initially compromised the download servers.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the initial compromise of the download servers, which falls under the **Initial Access** tactic.

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
