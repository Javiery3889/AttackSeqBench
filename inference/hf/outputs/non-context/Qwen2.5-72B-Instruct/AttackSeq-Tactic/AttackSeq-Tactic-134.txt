### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the threat actor FamousSparrow.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Acquiring domains and servers for infrastructure.
     - Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to gain access to victim systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Acquiring domains and servers for infrastructure:**
     - This action is part of the **Resource Development** tactic. It involves setting up the necessary infrastructure to support the attack, such as purchasing domains and servers.
   - **Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities:**
     - This action is part of the **Initial Access** tactic. It involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's network by exploiting vulnerabilities.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The question asks what tactic occurred **after** acquiring domains and servers for infrastructure and **before** exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.
   - Given the sequence:
     1. **Resource Development** (acquiring domains and servers)
     2. **Initial Access** (exploiting vulnerabilities)
   - The tactic that fits between these two actions is **Initial Access**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Resource Development** is the first step where the threat actor sets up the necessary infrastructure.
2. **Initial Access** is the next logical step where the threat actor uses the infrastructure to gain access to the victim's systems.
3. The other options do not fit the sequence:
   - **Discovery** typically occurs after gaining initial access to understand the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control** is established after gaining access to maintain control over the compromised systems.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Initial Access
