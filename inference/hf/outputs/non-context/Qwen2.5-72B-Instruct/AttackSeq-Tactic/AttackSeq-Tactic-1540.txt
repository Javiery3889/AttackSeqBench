### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where attackers have already used the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and compromise additional endpoints.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the attackers communicating with the compromised systems to check for new commands to execute.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This typically occurs before the initial compromise and is not relevant to the next step after mapping the network and compromising endpoints.
   - **B: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it is not the next logical step after the network has been mapped and endpoints have been compromised.
   - **C: Exfiltration** - This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's network. While this is a common goal of many attacks, it is not the immediate next step after mapping the network and compromising endpoints.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2)** - This tactic involves communicating with the compromised systems to control them and issue new commands. This is the most logical next step after the network has been mapped and endpoints have been compromised, as the attackers need to maintain control and manage the compromised systems.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is **Command and Control**.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
