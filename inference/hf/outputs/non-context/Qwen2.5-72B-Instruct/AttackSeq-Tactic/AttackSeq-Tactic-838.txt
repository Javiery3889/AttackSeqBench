### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where adversaries use spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments to compromise targets.
   - After the initial compromise, the adversaries execute JRat and Bandook malware on the victims' systems.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the initial compromise and the execution of the malware.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** This is the first step where the adversaries use spearphishing emails to gain access to the target systems.
   - **Execution of Malware:** This is the final step where JRat and Bandook malware are executed on the victims' systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - This is the initial step where the adversaries gain access to the target systems. It cannot be the tactic that occurs after the initial compromise.
   - **B: Collection**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the victim's system. While it can occur after initial access, it is not a necessary step before executing malware.
   - **C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. This is the step where the adversaries execute JRat and Bandook malware.
   - **D: Impact**
     - This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. It typically occurs after the execution of malware.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Initial Access** (spearphishing emails)
     2. **Execution** (of JRat and Bandook malware)
   - The tactic that must occur between these two steps is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
