### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the TG-3279 actors.
   - The sequence is: gaining credentials from network and system administrators, and then using key hosts running Conpee or Etso tools to deploy scheduled system tasks.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gaining credentials from network and system administrators.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Using key hosts running Conpee or Etso tools to deploy scheduled system tasks.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the adversary trying to map the network, identify key systems, and gather information about the environment.
     - This is typically done after gaining initial access and before moving laterally or executing further actions.
     - However, the question implies that the actors have already gained credentials, which suggests they have already performed some level of discovery.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network.
     - This is a logical next step after gaining credentials, as the actors would use these credentials to access other systems.
     - The use of key hosts running Conpee or Etso tools to deploy scheduled system tasks suggests that the actors are moving laterally to other systems.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques to obtain credentials from the target environment.
     - The question states that the actors have already gained credentials, so this step has already occurred.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code or commands on a system.
     - While this is a critical step, it is typically done after gaining access and possibly after lateral movement.
     - The use of Conpee or Etso tools to deploy scheduled system tasks is a form of execution, but it is not the immediate next step after gaining credentials.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the actors gained credentials, then used these credentials to move laterally within the network, and finally used key hosts to deploy scheduled system tasks.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after gaining credentials and before using Conpee or Etso tools is Lateral Movement.

### Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement
