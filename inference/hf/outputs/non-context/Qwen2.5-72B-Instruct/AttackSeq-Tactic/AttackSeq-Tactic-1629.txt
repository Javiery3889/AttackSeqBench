### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Grabit's keylogger functionality collects credentials.
   - The next step in the sequence is to enable the malware's 'call home' functionality over obvious channels.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial TTP:** Keylogger collects credentials (Credential Access).
   - **Next TTP:** Enable 'call home' functionality (Command and Control).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control:** This tactic involves the methods and protocols used by adversaries to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Enabling a 'call home' functionality is a clear example of Command and Control.
   - **B: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials such as account names and passwords. This has already been mentioned as the initial step.
   - **C: Impact:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. This is not relevant to enabling a 'call home' functionality.
   - **D: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. While defense evasion might be used to hide the 'call home' functionality, the question specifically asks about enabling the 'call home' functionality, which is more directly related to Command and Control.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that after collecting credentials, the next step is to enable the 'call home' functionality, which falls under the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: A: Command and Control**
