### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving the execution of an obfuscated VBScript using `wscript.exe` and the subsequent communication with a C&C server.
   - We need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Obfuscated VBScript executed using `wscript.exe`.
   - **Final Event:** VBS script communicates with a C&C server.
   - **Intermediate Event:** We need to determine what likely happened between these two events.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
     - This is less likely to occur immediately after the script execution and before C&C communication, as persistence is typically a longer-term goal.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise.
     - This is a plausible intermediate step, as the script might need to evade defenses to successfully communicate with the C&C server.
   - **C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information they can use to plan future operations.
     - This is less likely to occur between the script execution and C&C communication, as the script is already executing and the next logical step would be to establish communication.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.
     - This is the initial event described in the question, not an intermediate step.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible intermediate step between the execution of the obfuscated VBScript and the communication with the C&C server is **Defense Evasion**. The script would likely need to evade defenses to ensure it can successfully communicate with the C&C server.

### Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion
