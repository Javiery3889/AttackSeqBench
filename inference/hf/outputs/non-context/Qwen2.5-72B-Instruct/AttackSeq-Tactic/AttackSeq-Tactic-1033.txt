### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with the delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
   - The sequence ends with an automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted at servers.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application.
   - **Final Event:** Automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted at servers.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and before or during the execution of further attacks.
     - This could be a plausible step, but it is not the most immediate next step after delivering malware.
   - **B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves techniques that adversaries use to steal data from the target system. This typically occurs after the adversary has already gained access and executed their payload.
     - This is not a likely step immediately after delivering malware and before an automated attack.
   - **C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain entry into the network. This typically occurs before the delivery of malware.
     - Since the malware has already been delivered, this is not a plausible step.
   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that adversaries use to run their malicious code on the target system. This typically occurs after the malware has been delivered and before further attacks are launched.
     - This is the most logical step between the delivery of malware and the automated attack using the SMB protocol.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware was delivered, then executed, and then the automated attack using the SMB protocol was launched.

### Final Answer: D: Execution
