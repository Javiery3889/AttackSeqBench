### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events involving pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.
   - The sequence starts with the activists receiving a phishing email containing a malicious RAT (Remote Access Trojan) archive.
   - The sequence ends with the attackers creating two separate infection chains using executables within the archive.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Event:** Phishing email with a malicious RAR archive.
   - **Final Event:** Creation of two separate infection chains using executables within the archive.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This would typically occur before sending a phishing email.
   - **B: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to systems. This would typically occur after gaining initial access to the system.
   - **C: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code on the target system. This would occur after the initial access is gained, such as when the executables within the RAR archive are run.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold on the target system. This would occur when the phishing email is opened and the malicious RAR archive is executed.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question starts with the phishing email, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a system.
   - After the initial access is gained, the attackers would then execute the malicious executables within the RAR archive to create the infection chains.
   - Therefore, the most plausible TTP that occurred after the phishing email and before the creation of the infection chains is **Initial Access**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Initial Access
