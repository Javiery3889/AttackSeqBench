### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where attackers have already gained system information such as network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - The next step in the sequence is the execution of the TDrop2 malware using a process hollowing technique.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between these two stages.

2. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that attackers use to gain a foothold in the network. This typically happens before any system information is gathered.
     - Since the question states that system information has already been gathered, Initial Access is not the correct choice.

   - **B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves techniques that allow attackers to move through a network to expand their access. This typically happens after gaining initial access and gathering system information.
     - However, the question does not indicate that the attackers have moved to another system or expanded their access. Therefore, Lateral Movement is not the most plausible choice.

   - **C: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) involves techniques that allow attackers to communicate with systems they control within a target network. This typically happens after gaining initial access and gathering system information.
     - C2 is a necessary step before executing malware, as the attackers need to control the compromised system to execute the malware.
     - This choice aligns well with the sequence described in the question.

   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves techniques that attackers use to gather information about the target before or during an attack.
     - The question already states that system information has been gathered, which is a form of reconnaissance. However, the next step is the execution of malware, not further reconnaissance.
     - Therefore, Reconnaissance is not the most plausible choice.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described in the question, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gathering system information and before executing the TDrop2 malware is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
