### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where Taidoor attackers have established communication with C&C servers using RC4-encrypted HTTP requests.
   - The next step in the sequence involves using this connection to upload files from infected machines.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Establish Communication with C&C Servers:** This is part of the "Command and Control" tactic.
   - **Upload Files from Infected Machines:** This action involves sending data from the compromised system to an external location, which is a characteristic of the "Exfiltration" tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it might be a part of the attack, it does not directly relate to the described action of uploading files.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves communicating with the C&C server, which has already been established in the question. It does not describe the action of uploading files.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on a system. The question implies that this has already occurred and the focus is on the subsequent actions.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the process of stealing and sending data from the compromised system to an external location, which aligns perfectly with the described action of uploading files.

### Final Reasoning
- The sequence described in the question involves the attackers using the established C&C communication to upload files from infected machines.
- The action of uploading files is a clear example of data exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Exfiltration
