### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by a malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Evading defenses using a self-extracting wrapper file.
     - Executing the embedded DLL of the Gh0st Trojan.
     - Establishing communication using a custom network protocol through a server hosted at 98.126.67.114.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this could be a subsequent step, the question specifically mentions establishing communication, which is more aligned with a different tactic.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. The use of a self-extracting wrapper file to conceal the payload is a form of defense evasion, but the question is asking about the next step after the payload is executed.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Establishing communication with a server using a custom network protocol is a clear indication of C2 activity.
   - **D: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up servers or domains. This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of the question, which is about the actions taken after the payload is executed.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves:
     1. Evading defenses using a self-extracting wrapper file.
     2. Executing the embedded DLL of the Gh0st Trojan.
     3. Establishing communication with a server using a custom network protocol.
   - The establishment of communication with a server is a clear indication of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
