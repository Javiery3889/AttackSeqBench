### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an initial access was gained through a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document.
   - After gaining initial access, the group conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two stages.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - **Discovery:** Conducted detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. While this is a common next step after initial access, it is not necessarily the immediate next step before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. While this can occur after initial access, it is not typically the immediate next step before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic is already mentioned as the first step in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This is the next logical step after gaining initial access and before conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
     1. **Initial Access** (gaining access through a zero-day exploit in a Word document)
     2. **Discovery** (conducting detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations)
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after gaining initial access and before detailed system fingerprinting and discovery operations is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer: D: Discovery
