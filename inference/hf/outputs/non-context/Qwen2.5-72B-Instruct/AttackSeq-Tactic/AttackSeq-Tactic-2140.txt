### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where threat actors used AtomBombing to inject malicious code and execute it with the goal of bypassing security solutions.
   - The key elements are:
     - **AtomBombing**: A technique used to inject code into a process.
     - **Bypassing security solutions**: The goal of the code injection.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**: This tactic involves gathering data from the system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial code injection and execution.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis by security solutions. AtomBombing is a method of code injection that is specifically designed to evade security solutions, making this a strong candidate.
   - **C: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code. While the question mentions execution, it is part of the initial step of code injection, not a subsequent step.
   - **D: Discovery**: This tactic involves gathering information about the system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not directly related to the initial code injection and execution.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the threat actors used AtomBombing to inject and execute malicious code with the goal of bypassing security solutions, which aligns with the **Defense Evasion** tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion**
