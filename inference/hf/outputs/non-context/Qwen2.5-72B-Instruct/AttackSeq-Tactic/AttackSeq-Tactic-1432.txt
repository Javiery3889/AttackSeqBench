### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where StellarParticle used AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems.
   - The goal was to prepare for interrogating other infrastructure for additional access pathways.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The use of AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems is a clear indication of reconnaissance and discovery activities.
   - The purpose of these activities is to gain a better understanding of the target environment and identify potential targets for further exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Impact** - This tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not align with the described activities of gathering information.
   - **B: Reconnaissance** - This tactic involves gathering information to support planning for future operations. While this is a plausible choice, the use of AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems is more specifically aligned with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Credential Access** - This tactic involves attempting to identify and capture credentials. While this could be a subsequent step, the described activities are more focused on gathering information about the environment.
   - **D: Discovery** - This tactic involves attempting to identify system and network configurations, as well as the presence of security controls. The use of AdFind and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and systems is a clear example of the Discovery tactic.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Discovery
