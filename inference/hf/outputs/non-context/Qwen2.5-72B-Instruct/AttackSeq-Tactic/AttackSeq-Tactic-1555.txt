### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where threat actors have already gained access to servers through methods like panel login, SSH, or RDP.
   - After gaining access, the threat actors exposed malware controllers on specific ports for data transfer and command administration.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors gained access to the servers using methods like panel login, SSH, or RDP.
   - **Exposure of Malware Controllers:** The threat actors then exposed malware controllers on specific ports for data transfer and command administration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the most immediate action after exposing malware controllers.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with and controlling compromised systems. Exposing malware controllers on specific ports for data transfer and command administration aligns directly with the C2 tactic.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the compromised system. While this could be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate action after exposing malware controllers.
   - **D: Initial Access:** This tactic has already been completed by the threat actors using methods like panel login, SSH, or RDP.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the threat actors performed the **Command and Control** tactic after gaining access and exposing malware controllers.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
