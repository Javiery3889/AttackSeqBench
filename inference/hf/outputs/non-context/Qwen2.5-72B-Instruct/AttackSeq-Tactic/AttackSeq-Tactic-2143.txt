### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where an attacker gains initial access through a trojanized version of the CCleaner application.
   - After gaining initial access, the attacker then gathers system profile information, including the OS version and installed software.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains access through a trojanized version of the CCleaner application.
   - **Gathering System Profile Information:** The attacker collects information about the system, such as the OS version and installed software.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - The Discovery tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. This aligns with the step of gathering system profile information.
   - **Answer Choice B: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the attacker stealing and transferring data out of the network. This does not fit the sequence described, as the question does not mention data exfiltration at this stage.
   - **Answer Choice C: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains entry into the system. This has already occurred through the trojanized CCleaner application.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves the attacker running malicious code on the system. While this is a necessary step, it typically follows Initial Access and precedes Discovery. However, the question specifically asks about the step before gathering system profile information, which is more aligned with Discovery.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining initial access, the attacker would perform Discovery to gather system profile information.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
