### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the malware first gathers system information (IP address, Bitcoin wallet addresses) during the Discovery phase.
   - The next step in the sequence is the malware sending screen recordings and keystroke logs to the C&C server.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** Gathering system information (IP address, Bitcoin wallet addresses).
   - **Next Step:** Sending screen recordings and keystroke logs to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This is the initial phase where the malware gathers information about the system. However, it does not explain the action of sending screen recordings and keystroke logs.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it could be relevant, it does not directly explain the collection and exfiltration of data.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data from the system, which aligns with the action of capturing screen recordings and keystroke logs.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While it is important, it does not directly explain the collection and exfiltration of data.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after the Discovery phase, the malware would move to the Collection phase to gather the screen recordings and keystroke logs.
   - Once the data is collected, it is then exfiltrated to the C&C server.

### Final Answer: C: Collection
