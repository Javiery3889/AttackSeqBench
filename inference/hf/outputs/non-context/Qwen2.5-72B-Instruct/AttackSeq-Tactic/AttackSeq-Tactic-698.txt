### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions by the Sednit group.
   - The sequence includes:
     1. Using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases.
     2. Scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The first action is using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases. This is clearly related to **Credential Access**.
   - The second action is scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions. This is related to **Discovery**.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Discovery**
     - This fits the second action in the sequence, where the group is scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions.
   - **Answer Choice B: Collection**
     - This is more about gathering data, which could be part of the scanning process, but it is not the primary focus of the described action.
   - **Answer Choice C: Credential Access**
     - This fits the first action in the sequence, where the group is using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases.
   - **Answer Choice D: Command and Control**
     - This is about maintaining control over the compromised system, which is not directly mentioned in the sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with **Credential Access** (using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases).
   - The next logical step is **Discovery** (scanning the local system, network shared drives, and removable media for specific file extensions).

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Discovery
