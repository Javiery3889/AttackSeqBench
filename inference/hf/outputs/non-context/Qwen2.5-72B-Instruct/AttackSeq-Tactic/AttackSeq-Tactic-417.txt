### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where threat actors:
     - Moved laterally using credentials obtained via Mimikatz.
     - Executed commands on other systems.
     - Maintained interaction with the compromised server and executed further commands.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The threat actors used credentials obtained via Mimikatz to move laterally to other systems.
   - **Execution:** The threat actors executed commands on the compromised systems.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The threat actors maintained interaction with the compromised server and executed further commands, which suggests ongoing communication and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary means to conduct an attack, such as setting up infrastructure. It does not fit the context of maintaining interaction and executing further commands.
   - **B: Lateral Movement:** While lateral movement is part of the sequence, it does not describe the ongoing interaction and command execution.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining initial access to the network, which has already occurred in the sequence described.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with and controlling the compromised systems, which aligns with the described actions of maintaining interaction and executing further commands.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
