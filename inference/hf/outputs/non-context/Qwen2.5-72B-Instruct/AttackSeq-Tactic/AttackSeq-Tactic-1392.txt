### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT10.
   - The sequence includes:
     - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Mapping out the network using common Windows and open-source pentesting tools.
     - **Staging Data for Exfiltration:** Preparing data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt business processes or deny access to resources. This is typically a final step in an attack, not something that occurs between reconnaissance and data staging.
   - **Answer Choice B: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. This is a logical step after reconnaissance, as the attacker would use the information gathered to move to other systems within the network.
   - **Answer Choice C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration is the process of transferring data out of the network. This is the final step in the sequence, occurring after data has been staged.
   - **Answer Choice D: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the target network, which is what the internal reconnaissance step is. Since the question already mentions reconnaissance, this is not a plausible choice for the step that occurs after reconnaissance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence is:
     1. **Reconnaissance (Discovery)**
     2. **Lateral Movement**
     3. **Staging Data for Exfiltration**
     4. **Exfiltration**

   Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after internal reconnaissance and before staging data for exfiltration is **Lateral Movement**.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
