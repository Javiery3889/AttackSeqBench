### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where WinDealer processes and stages stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.
   - Before this, the malware collects network configuration and details from SNS (Social Networking Service) applications.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications.
   - This is followed by processing and staging the stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**

   - **A: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as passwords, passcodes, and hashes.
     - While this is a common tactic in many attacks, it is not directly related to the collection of network configuration and SNS details.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network.
     - Collecting network configuration and details from SNS applications aligns well with the Discovery tactic, as it involves gathering information about the environment.

   - **C: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves techniques that adversaries use to establish resources they can use to support operations.
     - This is typically a pre-attack phase and does not fit the context of collecting network configuration and SNS details during an active attack.

   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the system.
     - While Collection is a relevant tactic, it is more about gathering the actual data to be exfiltrated, which in this case is the network configuration and SNS details. However, the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred before the data was processed and staged.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the adversary first used Discovery techniques to collect network configuration and details from SNS applications, which then led to the processing and staging of the stolen data in the %TEMP% folder.

### Final Answer: B: Discovery
