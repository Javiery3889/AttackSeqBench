### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Leveraging obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant.
     - Collecting extensive data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between these two steps.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**:
     - This tactic involves gathering data from various sources on the system. However, the question states that data collection happens after the execution of the Korplug variant.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**:
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While obfuscation is a form of defense evasion, the question is asking about what happens after the execution of the Korplug variant but before data collection.
   - **C: Discovery**:
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the system and network. It is a logical step to take after gaining initial access and before collecting data, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to know what data to collect.
   - **D: Resource Development**:
     - This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed for an attack, such as setting up command and control servers. This typically happens before the initial compromise, not between execution and data collection.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. Leveraging obfuscated loaders to execute the Korplug variant (Initial Access and Execution).
     2. **Discovery** (to understand the system and network).
     3. Collecting extensive data from the system, removable media, and network shared drives (Collection).
   - The most logical step between executing the Korplug variant and collecting data is to discover the environment to identify what data to collect.

**Final Answer: C: Discovery**
