### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the ProjectM actors delivered payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - The key activities mentioned are:
     - Delivering payloads via spear-phishing emails.
     - Using watering hole attacks.
     - Exploiting known vulnerabilities.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target before launching an attack. This could include identifying potential targets, understanding their network infrastructure, and finding vulnerabilities.
     - This is a logical first step before delivering payloads via spear-phishing or watering hole attacks, as the attackers need to know who to target and how to exploit them.

   - **Impact (B):**
     - Impact involves the effects of the attack, such as data destruction, denial of service, or data theft.
     - This typically occurs after the initial compromise and is not a prerequisite for delivering payloads.

   - **Resource Development (C):**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as creating malware, setting up command and control (C2) infrastructure, and developing attack tools.
     - While this is important, it is not directly related to the specific activities of spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.

   - **Defense Evasion (D):**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis by security systems.
     - This is typically used during or after the initial compromise to maintain access and avoid detection, not before the delivery of payloads.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the ProjectM actors would have conducted **Reconnaissance** before delivering payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities.

**Final Answer: A: Reconnaissance**
