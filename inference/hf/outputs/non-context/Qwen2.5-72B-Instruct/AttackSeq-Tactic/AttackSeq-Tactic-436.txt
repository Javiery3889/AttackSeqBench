### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the Gamaredon group.
   - The sequence includes the use of obfuscated VBS scripts to evade detection and a failure to acquire additional payloads from an inaccessible C2 server.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Obfuscated VBS Scripts:** This is a technique used to evade detection, which falls under the **Defense Evasion** tactic.
   - **Failure to Acquire Additional Payloads from an Inaccessible C2 Server:** This indicates an issue with the **Command and Control** (C2) communication.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Credential Access:** This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, such as usernames and passwords. It is not directly related to the sequence described, which focuses on evasion and C2 communication.
   - **B: Defense Evasion:** This tactic includes techniques to avoid detection, which aligns with the use of obfuscated VBS scripts. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after the evasion and before the C2 failure.
   - **C: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. The failure to acquire additional payloads from an inaccessible C2 server is a direct indication of issues with C2 communication. This is the most logical next step after evading detection.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information before an attack. It is not relevant to the sequence described, which is focused on post-infection activities.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that after the attacker used obfuscated VBS scripts to evade detection, they attempted to communicate with the C2 server to acquire additional payloads. The failure to do so indicates a problem with the C2 communication.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
