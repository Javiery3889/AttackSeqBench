### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in an attack.
   - The sequence starts with Higaisa distributing malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
   - The sequence then involves the LNK file initiating a multi-stage attack, including copying its content to a temporary directory and using `certutil.exe` to decode a base64 blob.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Higaisa distributed malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** The LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Copying content to a temporary directory and using `certutil.exe` to decode a base64 blob.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Initial Access**
     - This tactic is already mentioned in the question as the initial step where Higaisa distributed the malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
     - This cannot be the answer because it is the starting point of the sequence, not what happens after the initial access.

   - **Answer Choice B: Execution**
     - This tactic involves the adversary running malicious code on a victim's system.
     - The LNK file initiating a multi-stage attack, including copying its content to a temporary directory and using `certutil.exe` to decode a base64 blob, is a clear example of the Execution tactic.
     - This is a strong candidate for the answer.

   - **Answer Choice C: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves the adversary preparing the infrastructure and resources needed for the attack, such as setting up command and control servers or creating malicious files.
     - This is not relevant to the sequence described in the question, which focuses on the actions taken after the initial access and before the execution of the multi-stage attack.

   - **Answer Choice D: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves the adversary attempting to obtain credentials to gain access to additional systems or accounts.
     - The question does not mention any attempts to obtain credentials between the initial access and the execution of the multi-stage attack.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after the initial access (spear-phishing), the next step is the execution of the malicious LNK file, which initiates the multi-stage attack.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is the Execution tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Execution
