### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold in victim networks.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred **after** this initial foothold was established.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Foothold:** Exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Next Step:** The question is asking what the attackers likely did after gaining this initial foothold.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the victim network. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access, as the attackers would want to ensure they can maintain their presence.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. This is typically part of the initial foothold phase, not what happens after the foothold is established.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the victim network. This is a logical next step after gaining initial access, as the attackers would want to understand the network environment to plan further actions.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to obtain credentials to access other systems. This is also a logical next step after gaining initial access, as the attackers would want to move laterally within the network.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - After gaining an initial foothold, the most immediate and common next steps are to ensure persistence and to discover the network environment.
   - **Persistence** is crucial for maintaining access, but **Discovery** is often the first step to understand the network and plan further actions.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Discovery
