### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the attackers have employed anti-analysis features like code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, and process hollowing.
   - The next step in the attack sequence involves the attackers coordinating multiple operations against different targets using specific domains (axroot.com and adobeair.net).

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. The mentioned anti-analysis features (code obfuscation, anti-virtualization, and process hollowing) are indeed part of Defense Evasion. However, the question asks about the next step after these techniques have been employed.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2)**
     - Command and Control involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems under their control within a target network. Using specific domains (axroot.com and adobeair.net) to coordinate multiple operations aligns well with C2 activities.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While this is a crucial step in many attack sequences, the use of specific domains to coordinate operations is more indicative of C2.
   - **D: Credential Access**
     - Credential Access involves techniques that adversaries use to capture credentials from a target. This is not directly related to the coordination of operations using specific domains.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The initial steps of the attack involve Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - The next logical step, given the use of specific domains to coordinate multiple operations, is Command and Control.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after employing anti-analysis features, the attackers moved to Command and Control to coordinate their operations.

**Final Answer: B: Command and Control**
