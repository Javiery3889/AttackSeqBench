### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where KiraV2 periodically communicates with its C&C server to receive attack commands.
   - The next step in the sequence is to determine which ATT&CK tactic is most likely to follow, specifically to disrupt the availability of targeted services through DDoS attacks.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):**
     - This tactic involves the communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure. Since the question already states that KiraV2 is communicating with the C&C server, this is not the next step in the sequence.
   - **B: Impact:**
     - The Impact tactic includes actions that disrupt the availability of systems, such as DDoS attacks. This aligns well with the goal of disrupting the availability of targeted services.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information to plan future attacks. While reconnaissance is important, it typically occurs before the initial compromise and communication with the C&C server.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:**
     - This tactic involves moving through a network to expand the attacker's control. While lateral movement can be part of a broader attack, it is not directly related to disrupting the availability of services through DDoS attacks.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the goal of disrupting the availability of targeted services through DDoS attacks, is the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: B: Impact**
