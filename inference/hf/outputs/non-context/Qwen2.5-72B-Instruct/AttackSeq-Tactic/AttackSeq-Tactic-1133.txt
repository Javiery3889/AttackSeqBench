### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question states that APT42 used application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control communications with compromised systems.
   - The key phrase here is "command and control communications."

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods an adversary uses to gain an initial foothold in a network. While this is a crucial step in an attack, the question specifically mentions command and control communications, which occur after initial access has been established.
   - **B: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the adversary stealing data from the network. While exfiltration is a common goal, the question does not mention data theft, only command and control communications.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the methods an adversary uses to communicate with systems they control within a target network. The question explicitly mentions the use of application layer protocols and encrypted channels for command and control, which aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the adversary's actions to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data. The question does not mention any impact or destructive actions, only command and control communications.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the Command and Control tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Command and Control**
