### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Victims enabling macros.
     - This action triggers the download of a heavily packed, second-stage downloader.
     - Lokibot achieves privilege escalation using a 'fileless' UAC bypass technique.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic occurred between the download of the second-stage downloader and the privilege escalation.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords.
     - It is not directly related to the sequence of events described, as the question does not mention credential theft between the download and privilege escalation.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system.
     - The question explicitly states that privilege escalation occurs after the second-stage downloader is downloaded, so this cannot be the correct answer.
   - **C: Execution**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to run malicious code on a victim's system.
     - After the second-stage downloader is downloaded, it needs to be executed to proceed with the attack. This fits well with the sequence described.
   - **D: Command and Control**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to communicate with systems they control within a victim's network.
     - While this is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs after the initial execution and before or during the privilege escalation. However, the question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred after the download and before the privilege escalation.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after the second-stage downloader was downloaded and before privilege escalation is **Execution**.

**Final Answer: C: Execution**
