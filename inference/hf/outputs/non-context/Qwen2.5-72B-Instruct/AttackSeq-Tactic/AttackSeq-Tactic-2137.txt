### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by APT15.
   - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz for privilege escalation.
   - They then enabled their RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Action:** Gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Subsequent Action:** Enabled RoyalCLI backdoor to bypass command prompt execution policies.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection or analysis. Bypassing policy settings to enable a backdoor (RoyalCLI) to execute commands is a clear example of defense evasion.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions. While gaining domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz is a form of privilege escalation, the question specifically asks about the action that followed this.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. This does not align with the described action of bypassing command prompt execution policies.
   - **D: Collection**
     - Collection involves techniques that adversaries use to gather data from the system. This does not align with the described action of bypassing command prompt execution policies.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that after gaining domain administrator credentials, APT15 used defense evasion techniques to bypass policy settings and enable their RoyalCLI backdoor.

### Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
