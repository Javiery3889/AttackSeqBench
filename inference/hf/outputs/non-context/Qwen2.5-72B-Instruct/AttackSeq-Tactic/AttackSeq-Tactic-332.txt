### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where the Bankshot implant has already evaded detection and persisted on the victim's network.
   - The implants are disguised as ZIP files and are communicating with hardcoded control servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Evasion and Persistence:** The implant has already evaded detection and persisted on the network.
   - **Disguise as ZIP Files:** The implants are disguised as ZIP files, which is a form of defense evasion.
   - **Communication with Control Servers:** The implants are communicating with hardcoded control servers, which is a key aspect of command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through the network to gain access to additional systems. The question does not mention any movement to other systems, so this is not the most likely tactic.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the network and systems. The question does not mention any discovery activities, so this is not the most likely tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While the implants are disguised as ZIP files, which is a form of defense evasion, the question specifically asks about the communication with control servers.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves communicating with the attacker's infrastructure to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The implants communicating with hardcoded control servers is a clear indication of command and control.

### Final Reasoning
- The implants are already on the network and have evaded detection, which aligns with defense evasion.
- However, the specific action of communicating with hardcoded control servers is a clear indication of the command and control tactic.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: D: Command and Control
