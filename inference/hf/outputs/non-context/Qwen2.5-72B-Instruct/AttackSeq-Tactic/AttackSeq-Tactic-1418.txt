### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 via spear-phishing emails.
     - Implanting the PlugX RAT.
     - Implementing persistence mechanisms like Service + Run Key configuration.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred between the exploitation and the implementation of persistence mechanisms.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence**
     - This is the final step mentioned in the sequence, so it cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation**
     - This tactic is often used to gain higher-level access to the system, which might be necessary before implementing persistence mechanisms. However, it is not necessarily a required step between exploitation and persistence.
   - **C: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves the attacker gathering information about the system and network. It is a common step after gaining initial access to understand the environment before taking further actions.
   - **D: Execution**
     - This tactic involves running the malicious payload (in this case, the PlugX RAT). Since the question states that the PlugX RAT has already been implanted, this step has already occurred.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events is:
     1. Exploit CVE-2012-0158 via spear-phishing emails.
     2. Implant the PlugX RAT (Execution).
     3. (Unknown step).
     4. Implement persistence mechanisms.
   - After the initial exploitation and implantation of the RAT, the attacker would likely need to gather information about the system to understand the environment and plan the next steps.
   - Therefore, the most plausible tactic that fits between the implantation of the RAT and the implementation of persistence mechanisms is **Discovery**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Discovery
