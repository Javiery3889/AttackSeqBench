### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by APT42.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Internal reconnaissance by accessing collaborative spaces.
     - Stealing credentials.
     - Performing follow-on operations.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to access additional systems and resources. This typically occurs after gaining initial access and often after discovering the network layout and valuable assets.
     - While lateral movement could occur after internal reconnaissance, it is not the most immediate next step in the sequence described.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves gathering information about the network, systems, and users. This is a critical step after initial reconnaissance to understand the environment and identify potential targets for credential theft and other follow-on operations.
     - Given that the question mentions internal reconnaissance, the next logical step would be to perform further discovery to gather more detailed information.

   - **C: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves stealing data and sending it out of the network. This typically occurs after gaining access to the desired data and is a final step in the attack sequence.
     - Exfiltration is not a logical next step after internal reconnaissance and before stealing credentials.

   - **D: Privilege Escalation**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions to access more resources and perform more actions. This is often a step taken after initial access and discovery to gain the necessary permissions to steal credentials and perform follow-on operations.
     - While privilege escalation is a plausible step, it is not the most immediate next step after internal reconnaissance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that Discovery occurred after internal reconnaissance and before stealing credentials and performing follow-on operations.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
