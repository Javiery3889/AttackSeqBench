### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where threat actors used spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks to compromise victims in the CIS countries.
   - The key TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Spear-Phishing Emails**: This is a technique used to gain initial access to a victim's system.
     - **Spoofed Banking Hyperlinks**: These are used to trick victims into clicking on malicious links, which can lead to the execution of malicious code or the theft of credentials.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this could be a subsequent step after gaining initial access, it is not the most immediate next step in the sequence described.
   - **B: Credential Access**: This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the victim. This could be a plausible next step if the spear-phishing email was designed to steal credentials, but it is not the most immediate next step.
   - **C: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the infrastructure needed to support an attack. This is typically done before the attack, not after gaining initial access.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining initial access to a victim's system. The spear-phishing emails containing spoofed banking hyperlinks are a technique used to achieve initial access.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the threat actor used spear-phishing emails to gain initial access to the victims' systems. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: D: Initial Access**
