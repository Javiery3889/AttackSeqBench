### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker has already captured credentials, enabled remote access, and is now focusing on gathering credit card data.
   - The specific method of gathering credit card data involves monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Compromise:** Capturing credentials from compromised hotel systems.
   - **Establishing Access:** Enabling remote access.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing credit card details.
   - **Specific Data Gathering Method:** Monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery:** This tactic involves the attacker trying to understand the environment, such as network topology, system configurations, and user roles. While this is a crucial step in the attack lifecycle, it does not align with the specific action of monitoring the clipboard and printer documents.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves maintaining access to the system over time. While enabling remote access is a form of persistence, the question is asking about the next step after remote access has been established.
   - **C: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. Monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer is a clear example of data collection.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to gain access to systems. The question states that credentials have already been captured, so this is not the next step.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attacker is performing data collection by monitoring the clipboard and documents sent to the printer.

**Final Answer: C: Collection**
