### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where the threat actor:
     - Gained initial access through spear-phishing emails.
     - Ensured persistence by injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe`.
   - We need to determine what ATT&CK tactic occurred between these two events.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves the threat actor gathering information about the system and network. This is a common next step after gaining initial access to understand the environment and identify potential targets for further actions.
   - **B: Execution**
     - Execution involves running malicious code. This is typically part of the initial access phase, where the threat actor delivers and executes the payload. However, the question already states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing, so this is not the next step.
   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves maintaining access to the system over time. The question states that persistence was achieved by injecting a watchdog thread into `explorer.exe`, which is the final step in the sequence.
   - **D: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves gaining the initial foothold in the system. The question already states that initial access was gained through spear-phishing, so this is not the next step.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence described, the most plausible tactic that occurred after gaining initial access and before ensuring persistence is **Discovery**. The threat actor would likely need to gather information about the system and network to plan further actions, such as establishing persistence.

**Final Answer: A: Discovery**
