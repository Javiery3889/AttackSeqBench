### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where APT41 discovered game production environments by pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.
   - The next step in the sequence is the collection of source code and digital certificates.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the collection phase.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Collection**:
     - This is the final step mentioned in the question, where APT41 collects source code and digital certificates. Therefore, this cannot be the answer.
   - **B: Lateral Movement**:
     - Lateral Movement involves moving through a network to expand access and control. The question mentions pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, which is a clear indication of lateral movement.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation**:
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions to access more resources. While this is a common tactic, the question does not specifically mention gaining higher privileges before collecting the source code and digital certificates.
   - **D: Persistence**:
     - Persistence involves maintaining long-term access to a system. While this is a crucial tactic, the question does not indicate that APT41 was setting up persistence mechanisms before collecting the source code and digital certificates.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that APT41 performed lateral movement before collecting the source code and digital certificates.

**Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement**
