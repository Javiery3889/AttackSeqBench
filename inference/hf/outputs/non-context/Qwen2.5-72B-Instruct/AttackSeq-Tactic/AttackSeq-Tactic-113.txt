### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by Charming Kitten, a known threat actor.
   - The sequence involves developing phishing sites impersonating services like Google Drive and social networks, and then gaining initial access through spear-phishing methods.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Step 1:** Development of phishing sites.
   - **Step 2:** Gaining initial access through spear-phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Resource Development:**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources for an attack, such as setting up phishing sites. This aligns with the first step in the sequence.
   - **B: Reconnaissance:**
     - This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While it is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the development of phishing sites.
   - **C: Collection:**
     - This tactic involves gathering data from the target after gaining access. It is not relevant to the sequence described, as it occurs after initial access.
   - **D: Discovery:**
     - This tactic involves understanding the target's environment after gaining access. It is also not relevant to the sequence described, as it occurs after initial access.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that Charming Kitten first developed the necessary resources (phishing sites) and then used these resources to gain initial access through spear-phishing.
   - Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after developing the phishing sites and before gaining initial access is **Resource Development**.

### Final Answer: A: Resource Development
