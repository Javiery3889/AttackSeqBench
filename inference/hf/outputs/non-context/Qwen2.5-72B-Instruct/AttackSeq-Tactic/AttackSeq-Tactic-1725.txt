### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where MuddyWater initially gains access through spear-phishing attacks.
   - After gaining initial access, MuddyWater uses a web control server and an infiltration tool named muddyc3 for managing their operations.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing attacks are used to gain initial access.
   - **Next Step:** The use of a web control server and an infiltration tool (muddyc3) suggests that the attackers are establishing a command and control (C2) channel to manage their operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection. While it is a common next step after gaining access, the question specifically mentions the use of a web control server and an infiltration tool, which are more indicative of establishing C2.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves techniques to communicate with systems under the attacker's control. The use of a web control server and muddyc3 aligns perfectly with this tactic.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic is already mentioned as the first step (spear-phishing). It cannot be the next step.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques to maintain access to systems over time. While it is a common next step, the question specifically highlights the establishment of a C2 channel, which is more directly related to Command and Control.

### Final Reasoning
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is:
1. **Initial Access** (spear-phishing)
2. **Command and Control** (using a web control server and muddyc3)

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: Command and Control
