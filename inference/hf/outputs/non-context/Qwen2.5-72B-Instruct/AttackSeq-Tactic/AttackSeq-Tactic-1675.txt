### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where an attacker has created a Portable Executable (PE) file and set up a scheduled task to run this file every minute.
   - The goal is to ensure that the malware remains active by running the binary frequently.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Creation of a PE file:** This is part of the initial execution phase.
   - **Setting up a scheduled task:** This is a technique used to ensure that the malware continues to run over time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Resource Development:** This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or gathering information. It does not fit the context of ensuring the malware remains active.
   - **B: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malware. While the creation of the PE file is part of execution, the question is asking about the next step to ensure the malware remains active.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. It does not directly relate to ensuring the malware runs frequently.
   - **D: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the system. Setting up a scheduled task to run the malware every minute is a classic example of a persistence technique.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of ensuring the malware remains active by running the binary every minute, is **Persistence**.

**Final Answer: D: Persistence**
