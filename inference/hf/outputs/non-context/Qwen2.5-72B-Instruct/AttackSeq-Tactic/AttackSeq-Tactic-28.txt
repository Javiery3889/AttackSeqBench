### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the malware evolved to incorporate a dual file structure and began checking for the presence of a previous version file of KONNI on the system.
   - The key points are:
     - The malware evolved to incorporate a dual file structure.
     - The malware began checking for the presence of a previous version file.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to steal credentials such as usernames and passwords. While this is a common early stage in many attacks, it does not directly relate to the evolution of the malware's file structure or version checking.
   - **B: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the system and network. While discovery can occur early in an attack, it does not directly relate to the malware's file structure or version checking.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. The evolution of the malware to incorporate a dual file structure and check for a previous version file are both methods of defense evasion. The dual file structure can make the malware more difficult to detect, and checking for a previous version file can help the malware avoid overwriting itself or conflicting with existing infections.
   - **D: Lateral Movement**
     - This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to move through a network to expand their access. While lateral movement is a common tactic, it does not directly relate to the evolution of the malware's file structure or version checking.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the malware evolved to incorporate a dual file structure and began checking for the presence of a previous version file as part of its defense evasion strategy.

**Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion**
