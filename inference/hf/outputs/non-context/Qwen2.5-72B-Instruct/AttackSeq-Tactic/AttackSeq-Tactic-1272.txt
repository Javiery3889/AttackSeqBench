### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk.
   - The key activities mentioned are "scanning and mapping targets" using SharpHound and PowerSploit.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Scanning and Mapping Targets:** This activity is typically associated with the **Discovery** tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Discovery involves the adversary attempting to understand the environment they are operating in, such as network topology, system configurations, and user information.
   - **SharpHound and PowerSploit:** These tools are often used for network discovery and reconnaissance. SharpHound is specifically designed for mapping Active Directory environments, while PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks, including discovery and exploitation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network. While it is a common step in an attack, it typically follows initial access and discovery.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target environment. Given that SharpHound and PowerSploit are used for scanning and mapping, this aligns perfectly with the Discovery tactic.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a target system. While execution is necessary to run tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit, the question is asking about what happened before these tools were used, not the execution itself.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves obtaining credentials to access systems. While credential access can be a precursor to discovery, the question specifically mentions scanning and mapping, which is more directly related to the Discovery tactic.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the Discovery tactic occurred before TG1021 utilized SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
