### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence where SkinnyBoy collects base64 encoded data from systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories using the CryptBinaryToStringA API.
   - The next step in the sequence is to transfer this data to the C2 (Command and Control) server.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the attacker communicating with the compromised system to control it. While C2 is crucial for maintaining control, it is not the primary action of transferring collected data.
   - **B: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system. The question does not mention any attempts to escalate privileges, so this is not relevant.
   - **C: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves the transfer of data from the compromised system to an external location, such as a C2 server. This aligns perfectly with the described action of transferring collected data.
   - **D: Impact:** This tactic involves the consequences of the attack, such as data destruction or denial of service. The question does not mention any impact actions, so this is not relevant.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is the transfer of collected data to the C2 server, which falls under the Exfiltration tactic.

**Final Answer: C: Exfiltration**
