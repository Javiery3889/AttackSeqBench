### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers used tools like Medusa and Fast SYN Scanner to enumerate services, fingerprint SMTP servers, and authenticate on VNC and RDP ports.
   - These actions are part of the initial stages of an attack, where the attackers are gathering information and attempting to gain access to the target system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining access to the target system. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting, and authenticating) are often part of the initial access phase, but they are more focused on the reconnaissance and discovery stages.
   - **B: Command and Control:** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. The actions described do not align with command and control, as they are more about gaining initial access and gathering information.
   - **C: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. The actions described (enumerating services, fingerprinting SMTP servers) are typical reconnaissance activities.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target system after gaining access. The actions described (authenticating on VNC and RDP ports) can be part of the discovery phase, but the initial enumeration and fingerprinting are more aligned with reconnaissance.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the described actions is that the attackers were performing reconnaissance to gather information about the target system before attempting to gain access.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
