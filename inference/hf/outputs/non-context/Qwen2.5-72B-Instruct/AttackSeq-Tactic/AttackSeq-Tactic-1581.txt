### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker uses Process Hollowing for defense evasion and then performs discovery using the `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` function to identify the `explorer` process.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after these initial steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** Process Hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` function is used to gather information about running processes, which is a discovery technique.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code. While execution is a crucial part of the attack, it typically occurs before or in conjunction with defense evasion and discovery. Given that the question already mentions defense evasion and discovery, it is less likely that execution would be the next step.
   - **B: Discovery:** This tactic involves gathering information about the system. Since the question already mentions the use of `CreateToolhelp32snapshot` for discovery, it is unlikely that another discovery step would be the next logical step.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. After evading defenses and gathering information about the system, the next logical step would be to establish a command and control channel to maintain access and control over the compromised system.
   - **D: Collection:** This tactic involves gathering data of interest to the attacker. While collection is a common next step, it typically follows the establishment of a command and control channel to ensure the attacker can exfiltrate the collected data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible next step after defense evasion and discovery is to establish a command and control channel to maintain access and control over the compromised system.

### Final Answer: C: Command and Control
