### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where FIN4 conducts reconnaissance to target individuals with access to confidential M&A and market-moving information.
   - The next step in the sequence is gaining initial access through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Reconnaissance**: This is the initial step where the attacker gathers information about the target.
   - **Initial Access**: This is the step where the attacker gains entry into the target's system, often through phishing or other means.

3. **Compare and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Reconnaissance**: This is the first step in the sequence, but the question asks what occurred **before** gaining initial access, which is already known to be reconnaissance.
   - **B: Persistence**: This tactic involves maintaining access to the target system over time. It typically occurs after initial access has been gained, not before.
   - **C: Defense Evasion**: This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by the target's defenses. It is usually employed after gaining initial access to avoid being discovered.
   - **D: Resource Development**: This tactic involves preparing the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the attack, such as setting up command and control servers, creating malicious documents, etc. This often occurs before the initial access phase to ensure the attacker has everything needed to execute the attack.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Reconnaissance â†’ Initial Access.
   - The question asks what occurred before gaining initial access, which is the preparation of resources and infrastructure needed for the attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is **Resource Development**.

### Final Answer: D: Resource Development
