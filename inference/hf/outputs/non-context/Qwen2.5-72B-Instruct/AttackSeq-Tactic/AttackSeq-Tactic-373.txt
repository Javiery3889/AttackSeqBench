### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome was exploited to trigger a Use-After-Free condition, which provided arbitrary read/write access.
   - After gaining this access, tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for malware persistence.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Exploit:** The zero-day vulnerability was exploited to gain initial access.
   - **Arbitrary Read/Write Access:** This step involves gaining control over the system to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Persistence:** Tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler to ensure the malware remains active even after system reboots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a victim's system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after gaining initial access and before setting up persistence.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker's tools and access remain on the victim's system. The question explicitly mentions that tasks were installed in the Windows Task Scheduler for persistence, which aligns with this tactic.
   - **C: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is a common step in many attack sequences, it is not the most immediate step after gaining arbitrary read/write access and before setting up persistence.
   - **D: Exfiltration:** This tactic involves stealing data from the victim's system. It is typically a later step in the attack sequence, after the attacker has established a foothold and possibly after persistence is set up.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial exploit of the zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) in Google Chrome to trigger a Use-After-Free condition is the first step.
   - This exploit provides arbitrary read/write access, which is necessary to execute further actions.
   - The next logical step is to set up persistence to ensure the attacker's access remains even after the system is rebooted.
   - Installing tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler is a common method for achieving persistence.
