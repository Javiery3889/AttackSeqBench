### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the initial step in the attack sequence for macOS malware like Alchimist, ChromeLoader, or CrateDepression.
   - The focus is on the tactic used to deliver the initial payloads or gain a foothold on the target systems.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the methods used to gain the initial foothold on a target system. This could include techniques like phishing, drive-by downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves the methods used to communicate with the compromised system after gaining access. It is not the initial step but rather a subsequent step.
   - **C: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques used to maintain access to a system over time. It is typically used after the initial access has been gained.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While important, it is not the step that delivers the initial payload or gains the initial foothold.

3. **Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:**
   - The question specifically asks about the tactic used to deliver the initial payloads or gain a foothold. This aligns with the **Initial Access** tactic.
   - **Initial Access** is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains the initial entry point into the target system.
   - The other tactics (Command and Control, Persistence, and Reconnaissance) are either subsequent steps or preparatory steps, but not the initial step for delivering the payload.

**Final Answer: A: Initial Access**
