### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the OceanLotus threat actors used base64 blobs in malicious Office documents to match the victim's system architecture and execute them.
   - The key elements are:
     - **Base64 blobs in malicious Office documents**
     - **Matching the victim's system architecture**
     - **Executing the malicious code**

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that threat actors use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing, drive-by downloads, or other methods to deliver the initial payload.
     - While Initial Access is a crucial first step, it typically involves getting the initial malicious document or link to the victim. The question implies that the threat actors are already in the process of delivering and executing the payload, which suggests that Initial Access has already occurred.

   - **B: Discovery**
     - Discovery involves techniques that threat actors use to gain information about the victim's environment, such as network topology, system architecture, and user information.
     - Matching the victim's system architecture (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit) is a form of discovery. The threat actors need to know the system architecture to ensure the base64 blobs will execute correctly.

   - **C: Persistence**
     - Persistence involves techniques that threat actors use to maintain their access to the victim's system over time.
     - While persistence is important, it typically occurs after the initial execution of the payload. The question focuses on the steps leading up to the execution of the base64 blobs, not maintaining access.

   - **D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that threat actors use to run malicious code on the victim's system.
     - The question explicitly mentions the execution of the base64 blobs, so this is the final step in the sequence. The question is asking about what happened before this execution.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible sequence is that the threat actors first discovered the victim's system architecture (Discovery) before executing the base64 blobs in the malicious Office documents.

**Final Answer: B: Discovery**
