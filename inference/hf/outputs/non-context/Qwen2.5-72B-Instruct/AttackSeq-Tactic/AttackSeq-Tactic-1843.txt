### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack where BlueDelta redirected victims' future incoming emails to an actor-controlled address by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before this action.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The action described (redirecting future incoming emails) is a form of persistence, as it ensures the attacker can continue to receive information from the victim's account even if the initial access is lost.
   - However, before the attacker can set up this persistence, they need to gain initial access to the victim's system.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Persistence**: This is the action described in the question (redirecting emails), so it cannot be the tactic that occurred before the described action.
   - **B: Execution**: This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While it is a crucial step in many attacks, it typically follows initial access.
   - **C: Exfiltration**: This tactic involves transferring data out of the victim's network. It is not a prerequisite for setting up persistence.
   - **D: Initial Access**: This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold in the victim's system. Exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to gain access is a common method of initial access.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence is that the attacker first gained initial access to the victim's system by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software, and then set up persistence by redirecting future incoming emails.

### Final Answer: D: Initial Access
