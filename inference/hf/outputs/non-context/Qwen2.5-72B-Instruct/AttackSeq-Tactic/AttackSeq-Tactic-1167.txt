### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where an attacker captures periodic screenshots and executes arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C server.
   - The question then asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the attacker blended its communications into legitimate traffic using public services as dead drop resolvers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Collection:** Capturing periodic screenshots.
   - **Execution:** Executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Blending communications into legitimate traffic using public services as dead drop resolvers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection (A):** Capturing periodic screenshots is a clear example of the Collection tactic, where the attacker gathers data from the victim's system.
   - **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. The question does not mention any lateral movement activities.
   - **Privilege Escalation (C):** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. The question does not mention any privilege escalation activities.
   - **Command and Control (D):** Blending communications into legitimate traffic using public services as dead drop resolvers is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic, where the attacker maintains control over the compromised system.

4. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Collection:** Capturing periodic screenshots.
     2. **Execution:** Executing arbitrary PowerShell scripts.
     3. **Command and Control:** Blending communications into legitimate traffic.
   - The question asks which tactic occurred before the blending of communications. Given the sequence, the tactic that occurred before blending communications is the Execution of arbitrary PowerShell scripts, which is part of the Command and Control phase.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs indicates that the Command and Control tactic (D) occurred before the blending of communications.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
