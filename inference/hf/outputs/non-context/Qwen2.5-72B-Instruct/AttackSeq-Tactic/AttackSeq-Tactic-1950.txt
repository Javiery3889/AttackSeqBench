### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events where OceanLotus distributed a backdoor via a zip file containing a disguised Microsoft Word document application bundle.
   - The backdoor was then executed.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The backdoor was distributed via a zip file, which is a common method for gaining initial access to a target system.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor was executed after the user opened the disguised Microsoft Word document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it can occur after initial access and execution, it is not the immediate next step in the sequence described.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on a system. The distribution of the backdoor via a zip file is part of the initial access phase.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running the malicious code on the target system. The question explicitly states that the backdoor was executed after the user opened the document.
   - **D: Credential Access:** This tactic involves attempting to obtain credentials from the target system. While it can occur after initial access and execution, it is not the immediate next step in the sequence described.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is: Initial Access (distribution of the backdoor via a zip file) followed by Execution (running the backdoor after the user opens the document).
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step after the backdoor was distributed and the user opened the document is **Execution**.

### Final Answer: C: Execution
