### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before StellarParticle established persistence.
   - The specific TTPs mentioned are:
     - **Credential Hopping:** This involves using stolen credentials to move laterally within a network.
     - **WMI Persistence:** This involves configuring Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to maintain persistence on a system.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This tactic involves the initial methods an attacker uses to gain a foothold in the network. This could include phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials. However, the question implies that the attacker has already gained access and is now establishing persistence.
   - **B: Persistence:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to maintain their foothold in the network. The question explicitly states that persistence is being established, so this cannot be the answer.
   - **C: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gain information about the network, systems, and users. Discovery often occurs after initial access and before establishing persistence, as the attacker needs to understand the environment to move laterally and set up persistence.
   - **D: Reconnaissance:** This tactic involves techniques that adversaries use to gather information before the attack. Reconnaissance typically occurs before the initial access and is not directly related to the establishment of persistence.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the attacker is already in the process of establishing persistence, the most likely preceding tactic is **Discovery**. The attacker would need to discover the network environment, identify potential targets, and gather information about credentials and systems to effectively use credential hopping and configure WMI persistence.

### Final Answer: C: Discovery
