### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs in the context of Operation Sharpshooter.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity.
     - Gathering information for potential exploitation.
     - Injecting a malicious macro into the memory of Word.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Answer Choice A: Impact**
     - The Impact tactic involves actions that disrupt availability or integrity, such as data destruction or denial of service. This does not fit the sequence described, which is more about gaining access and preparing for exploitation.
   - **Answer Choice B: Initial Access**
     - Initial Access involves techniques that adversaries use to gain a foothold in a network. This could include phishing, drive-by compromises, and other methods to get initial access. However, the question already mentions masquerading as legitimate activity and gathering information, which are more aligned with earlier stages.
   - **Answer Choice C: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to support planning for future operations. The question mentions gathering information for potential exploitation, which aligns well with the Reconnaissance tactic.
   - **Answer Choice D: Execution**
     - Execution involves techniques that result in the adversary running their code on a target system. The question mentions injecting a malicious macro into the memory of Word, which is an execution technique. However, this is described as occurring after the information gathering, so it is not the correct choice for the step in between.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Reconnaissance occurred after the initial masquerading and information gathering, and before the execution of the malicious macro.

**Final Answer: C: Reconnaissance**
