### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions where attackers have already mapped the internal network using Cobalt Strike and compromised additional credentials.
   - The next step in the sequence is the compromise of numerous workstations in search of critical information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Actions:**
     - Mapping the internal network using Cobalt Strike.
     - Compromising additional credentials.
   - **Next Action:**
     - Compromising numerous workstations to search for critical information.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Collection:**
     - Collection involves gathering data from the target network, which is a step that typically occurs after gaining access to the systems. However, the question specifies that the attackers are compromising workstations to search for critical information, which is more aligned with the Collection tactic.
   - **B: Resource Development:**
     - Resource Development involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or acquiring tools. This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not fit the context of the question, which describes actions that have already been taken.
   - **C: Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege Escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While this is a crucial step in many attacks, the question already mentions that additional credentials have been compromised, suggesting that privilege escalation has already occurred.
   - **D: Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral Movement involves moving from one system to another within the network to gain access to additional resources. This fits well with the context of the question, as the attackers are compromising numerous workstations to search for critical information, which is a clear indication of lateral movement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the question is that the attackers performed Lateral Movement after mapping the network and compromising additional credentials, before compromising numerous workstations to search for critical information.

### Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
