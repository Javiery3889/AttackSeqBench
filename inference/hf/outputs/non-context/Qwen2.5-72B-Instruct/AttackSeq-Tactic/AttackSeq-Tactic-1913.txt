### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of techniques used by the NanHaiShu group, including base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation.
   - These techniques are used to hinder detection of a decoy XLS and JScript file.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The techniques mentioned (base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation) are primarily used to evade detection mechanisms.
   - The goal is to make it difficult for security systems to identify and block the malicious files (decoy XLS and JScript file).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before an attack. It typically occurs before the actual attack and is not related to evading detection.
   - **Initial Access (B):** This tactic involves gaining entry into the target network. While it can involve some obfuscation, the primary focus is on gaining access, not evading detection.
   - **Discovery (C):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target network after gaining access. It is not directly related to evading detection.
   - **Defense Evasion (D):** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection by security systems. Base64 encoding and layered URL string obfuscation are classic examples of defense evasion techniques.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the techniques described, is **Defense Evasion**.

**Final Answer: D: Defense Evasion**
