### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs where Emissary Panda gains credential access using tools like Mimikatz and then performs lateral movement by exploiting EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144).
   - We need to determine which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the lateral movement.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Credential Access:** Using tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Exploiting EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) to move to other systems.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Defense Evasion:** This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis. While it is a common tactic, it is not necessarily a prerequisite for lateral movement.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic involves techniques used to gain initial access to a system. This typically happens before credential access and lateral movement, but it is not the immediate step before lateral movement.
   - **C: Lateral Movement:** This is the tactic that is explicitly mentioned in the question as the next step after gaining credentials. It cannot be the answer to what happened before lateral movement.
   - **D: Discovery:** This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the target system and network. Discovery is often performed after gaining initial access and before lateral movement to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain initial access to the system.
     2. **Discovery:** Gather information about the system and network.
     3. **Credential Access:** Use tools like Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
     4. **Lateral Movement:** Exploit vulnerabilities like EternalBlue to move to other systems.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D: Discovery
