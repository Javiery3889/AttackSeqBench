### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a scenario where an attacker has used Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and compromise additional endpoints.
   - The focus is on the TTP that most likely preceded the lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - The sequence involves:
     1. Using Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network.
     2. Compromising additional endpoints.
     3. Lateral movement to compromise numerous workstations.
     4. Searching for critical information.

3. **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Resource Development**
     - This tactic involves preparing the necessary resources for an attack, such as setting up infrastructure or creating accounts. It is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle but does not directly precede lateral movement.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - This tactic involves techniques to avoid detection and analysis. While it is important throughout the attack, it is not the primary focus before lateral movement.
   - **C: Credential Access**
     - This tactic involves techniques to obtain credentials, which are often necessary for lateral movement. Compromising additional endpoints and moving laterally often requires valid credentials.
   - **D: Discovery**
     - This tactic involves techniques to gather information about the network and systems. While it is important for mapping the network, it is not the primary focus before lateral movement.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Discovery**: Using Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network.
     2. **Credential Access**: Obtaining the necessary credentials to compromise additional endpoints.
     3. **Lateral Movement**: Using the obtained credentials to move laterally and compromise numerous workstations.
     4. **Impact**: Searching for critical information.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C: Credential Access
