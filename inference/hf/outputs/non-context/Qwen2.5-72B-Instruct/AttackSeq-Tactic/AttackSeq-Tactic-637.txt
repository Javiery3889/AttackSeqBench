### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs used by the GreyEnergy group.
   - The sequence starts with initial access through spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely informed the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers.
   - Strategic Targeting: ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**
   - **A: Command and Control**
     - Command and Control (C2) is the tactic used to establish and maintain control over compromised systems. It is typically used after initial access has been achieved and is not related to the strategic targeting of specific systems.
   - **B: Resource Development**
     - Resource Development involves building and maintaining the infrastructure and resources needed to conduct an attack. This could include setting up command and control servers, but it is not directly related to the strategic targeting of specific systems.
   - **C: Collection**
     - Collection is the tactic used to gather data from the target environment. While this is a crucial step in an attack, it is typically performed after initial access and is not the primary tactic for strategic targeting.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance is the tactic used to gather information about the target before the attack. This includes identifying potential vulnerabilities, understanding the target's network structure, and determining which systems are critical. This is the most likely tactic that would inform the strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that GreyEnergy used Reconnaissance to gather information about the target environment, which informed their strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

**Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance**
