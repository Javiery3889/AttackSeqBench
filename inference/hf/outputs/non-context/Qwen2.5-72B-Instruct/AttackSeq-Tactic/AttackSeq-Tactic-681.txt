### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where Volatile Cedar gained initial access by taking control of publicly facing web servers through vulnerability exploitation and manual hacking.
   - We need to determine the next logical step in the attack sequence after gaining initial access.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Persistence** - This tactic involves ensuring that the attacker maintains access to the system over time. After gaining initial access, it is common for attackers to establish persistence to maintain their foothold.
   - **B: Initial Access** - This tactic is already described in the question as the initial step where the attacker gains access through vulnerability exploitation and manual hacking.
   - **C: Resource Development** - This tactic involves preparing for an attack by gathering resources, which typically occurs before the initial access.
   - **D: Execution** - This tactic involves running malicious code on the target system. While this can occur after initial access, it is often a step that follows persistence to ensure the attacker can maintain control and execute their objectives.

3. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that the question states that initial access has already been achieved, the next logical step would be to establish persistence to ensure the attacker can maintain their access over time.
   - Therefore, the most plausible next step in the attack sequence is **Persistence**.

### Final Answer: A: Persistence
