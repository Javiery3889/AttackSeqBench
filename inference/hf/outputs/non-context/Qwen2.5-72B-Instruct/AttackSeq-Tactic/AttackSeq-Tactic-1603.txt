### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the attackers used spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access to the victim's system.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers used an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents to gain initial access.
   - **Gathering Information:** The attackers used an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before the attack. While reconnaissance is a crucial step, it typically occurs before the initial access, not after.
   - **Execution (B):** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this could be part of the attack, it is not the most likely step immediately after gaining initial access and before gathering information.
   - **Initial Access (C):** This tactic involves gaining access to the victim's system, which has already been described in the question. Therefore, it cannot be the next step.
   - **Command and Control (D):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the victim's system. While this is a crucial step, it typically occurs after the initial access and before or during the gathering of information.

4. **Determine the Most Plausible Sequence:**
   - The most logical sequence is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Gain access using spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents.
     2. **Execution:** Run the malicious code to establish a foothold.
     3. **Gathering Information:** Use an undocumented Word feature to gather information about the software installed on the victim's computer.

   - Given the sequence, the most likely tactic that occurred before the attackers used the undocumented Word feature to gather information is **Execution**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: Execution
