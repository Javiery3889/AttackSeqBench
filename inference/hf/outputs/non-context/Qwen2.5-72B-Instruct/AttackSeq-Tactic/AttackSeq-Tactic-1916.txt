### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of actions taken by the NanHaiShu malware.
   - The sequence includes:
     - Communication with C&C servers using HTTP POST to upload system information.
     - Communication with C&C servers using HTTP GET to download JScript and VBScript code.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next to transfer sensitive data.

2. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Exfiltration**
     - Exfiltration involves the transfer of data from a compromised system to an external location.
     - Given that the question asks about the transfer of sensitive data, this is a strong candidate.
   - **B: Defense Evasion**
     - Defense Evasion involves techniques to avoid detection or analysis.
     - While this is a common tactic, it does not directly relate to the transfer of sensitive data.
   - **C: Command and Control (C2)**
     - C2 involves establishing and maintaining control over a compromised system.
     - The initial communication with C&C servers is already described, so this is less likely to be the next step.
   - **D: Reconnaissance**
     - Reconnaissance involves gathering information to plan future attacks.
     - This is typically an early stage in the attack lifecycle and does not align with the transfer of sensitive data.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs, given the context of transferring sensitive data, is Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Exfiltration**
