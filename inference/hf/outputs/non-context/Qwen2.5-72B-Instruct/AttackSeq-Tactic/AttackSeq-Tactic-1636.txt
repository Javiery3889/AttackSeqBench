### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes an attack sequence where the actor uses spear-phishing emails with URLs linking to RAR files or malicious Microsoft Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to deliver NetTraveler.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after this initial step.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** The spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links are used to gain initial access to the target system.
   - **Exploitation:** The malicious Microsoft Word attachments exploit CVE-2012-0158 to execute code on the target system.
   - **Delivery of NetTraveler:** NetTraveler, a malware, is delivered to the target system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Initial Access:** This is the first step in the attack sequence, where the actor gains initial access to the target system. However, the question asks what happens after this step.
   - **B: Command and Control (C2):** After gaining initial access and delivering the malware, the next logical step is for the attacker to establish command and control over the compromised system. This allows the attacker to communicate with and control the malware.
   - **C: Persistence:** While persistence is a common next step, it typically follows the establishment of command and control. The attacker needs to ensure they can maintain access over time, but this is usually done after gaining control.
   - **D: Discovery:** Discovery involves the attacker exploring the network and gathering information about the compromised system and its environment. This is also a common next step, but it typically follows the establishment of command and control.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The most logical sequence is that after gaining initial access and delivering the malware, the attacker would establish command and control to communicate with and control the malware.

### Final Answer: B: Command and Control
