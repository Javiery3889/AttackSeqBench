### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in a cyber attack.
   - The sequence starts with social engineering to prompt targets to open malicious .src files.
   - The next step involves leveraging mechanisms such as shortcuts or fake binaries for persistence.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to execute arbitrary code on the infected hosts between these two steps.

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Initial Access:** Social engineering to prompt targets to open malicious .src files.
   - **Persistence:** Leveraging mechanisms such as shortcuts or fake binaries.
   - **Missing Tactic:** The tactic that executes arbitrary code on the infected hosts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Lateral Movement:** This tactic involves moving through a network to expand access. It is not relevant to the execution of arbitrary code on a single host.
   - **B: Initial Access:** This tactic is already covered by the social engineering step.
   - **C: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on a host, which fits the requirement of executing arbitrary code.
   - **D: Privilege Escalation:** This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on a system. While it might be a subsequent step, it is not the immediate step after initial access and before persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence starts with social engineering to gain initial access.
   - The next logical step is to execute the malicious code contained in the .src files.
   - After execution, the attacker might then set up persistence mechanisms.
   - Therefore, the missing tactic is **Execution**.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: C: Execution
