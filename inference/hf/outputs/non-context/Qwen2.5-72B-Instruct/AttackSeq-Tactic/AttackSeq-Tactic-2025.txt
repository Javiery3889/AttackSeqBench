### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question describes a sequence of events in a Cobalt Strike attack.
   - The sequence includes configuring Listeners in Cobalt Strike and the C2 server responding with a "beacon.dll".

2. **Identify the Sequence of TTPs:**
   - **Configuring Listeners:** This is a step where the attacker sets up the communication channels between the infected hosts and the C2 server.
   - **C2 Server Responding with "beacon.dll":** This is the step where the C2 server sends the beacon to the infected host to establish a persistent connection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **A: Execution:** This tactic involves running malicious code on the victim's system. While this is a crucial step in the attack, it typically occurs after the initial access and command and control setup.
   - **B: Impact:** This tactic involves the actual damage or disruption caused by the attack, such as data exfiltration or system destruction. This is a later stage in the attack lifecycle.
   - **C: Initial Access:** This tactic involves gaining the initial foothold on the victim's system. While this is a necessary step, it typically occurs before setting up the C2 communication.
   - **D: Command and Control (C2):** This tactic involves establishing and maintaining control over the compromised system. Configuring Listeners and the C2 server responding with "beacon.dll" are both part of the C2 process.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question involves setting up the communication channels (Listeners) and the C2 server responding with the beacon. These actions are directly related to the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

### Final Answer: D: Command and Control
