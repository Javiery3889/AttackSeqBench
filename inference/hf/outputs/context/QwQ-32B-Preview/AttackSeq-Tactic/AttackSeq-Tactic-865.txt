To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of events during the cyber attack attributed to the BlackEnergy APT group. The question specifically asks about the ATT&CK tactic that ensured the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup after the execution of "vba_macro.exe."

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - The attack involved a Microsoft Word document named "$RR143TB.doc" with a specific MD5 hash.
   - The document was designed to entice users to enable macros by claiming to contain content related to the "Right Sector" party in Ukraine.
   - Enabling the macros led to the execution of "vba_macro.exe," which is the BlackEnergy Trojan dropper.

2. **Execution:**
   - Upon enabling macros, the macro built a string in memory containing "vba_macro.exe" and executed it using the Shell command.
   - This execution dropped a DLL file as "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT" and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - The final payload, FONTCACHE.DAT, was designed to connect to a hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80.
   - It would send an HTTP POST request with victim information and request commands.

4. **Impact:**
   - The BlackEnergy APT group is known for destructive actions, compromising industrial control systems, and espionage activities.

5. **Others:**
   - Information about detections and additional resources from Kaspersky Lab.

Now, focusing on the question: "After the execution of 'vba_macro.exe' via the Shell command, which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensured that the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup?"

From the outline, we know that after executing "vba_macro.exe," the dropper dropped a DLL file as "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT" and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.

Let's map this to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

- **Reconnaissance (A):** This tactic involves gathering information about the target before or during an operation. It doesn't relate to ensuring execution on startup.

- **Lateral Movement (B):** This tactic involves an adversary moving through a network to access other systems or parts of a network. It's not directly related to ensuring execution on startup.

- **Command and Control (C):** This tactic involves communication between the adversary and their malware. While important, it doesn't directly ensure execution on startup.

- **Persistence (D):** This tactic involves an adversary ensuring they can maintain access to a system over time, often by creating mechanisms that allow them to regain access or keep their malware running.

Given that the dropper created a LNK file in the startup folder, this is a clear example of a persistence mechanism. LNK files in the startup folder are executed every time the system starts, ensuring that the malware is run automatically.

Therefore, the most plausible ATT&CK tactic that ensured the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup is **Persistence (D).**

**Final Answer: D**
