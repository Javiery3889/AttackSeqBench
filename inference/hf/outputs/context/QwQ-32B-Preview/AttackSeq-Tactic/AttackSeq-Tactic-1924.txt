To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of events that occur after initial access is gained through spearphishing emails. The question specifically asks about the tactic that involves the use of a downloader to install backdoor components on the compromised system.

First, let's look at the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access**: Machete uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments or links to gain initial access to the target system.

2. **Persistence**: After gaining access, Machete creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to maintain persistence and ensures its components continue to run even after system restarts or user logouts.

3. **Defense Evasion**: Machete employs various techniques to avoid detection, such as obfuscating scripts, using self-extracting files, and masquerading file and task names to look like legitimate applications.

4. **Credential Access**: Machete searches for and exfiltrates files containing stored credentials for various browsers.

5. **Discovery**: Machete gathers information about the compromised system, including listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, producing file listings, and enumerating running processes.

6. **Collection**: Machete steals data such as clipboard contents, copies files from local and removable media, logs keystrokes, captures screenshots, and stages data for exfiltration.

7. **Command and Control**: Machete communicates with its C&C servers using standard FTP and HTTP ports, downloads additional files for execution, and uses fallback channels if primary methods are unavailable.

8. **Exfiltration**: Machete automatically exfiltrates collected data to remote servers, encrypting it before transmission and using scheduled transfers.

Now, focusing on the sequence after initial access:

- After gaining initial access through spearphishing, Machete likely needs to establish a foothold on the system and set up mechanisms for ongoing access and control.

- The outline mentions that Machete creates persistence mechanisms, such as Windows Task Scheduler tasks, to ensure continued execution.

- Additionally, under "Command and Control," it's mentioned that Machete can download additional files for execution on the victim's machine.

Given this information, it's reasonable to infer that after initial access, Machete would use a downloader to install backdoor components to maintain persistence and establish command and control channels.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Privilege Escalation - This tactic involves gaining higher-level permissions on the system, which may occur after initial access but isn't directly related to installing backdoor components.

B: Initial Access - This is the tactic used to gain entry into the system, which is already established in the outline.

C: Command and Control - This involves maintaining communication with the compromised system, which aligns with the installation of backdoor components.

D: Execution - This tactic involves running malicious code on the system, which could be part of the initial access or subsequent stages.

Given that the question specifies the use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which are essential for maintaining access and controlling the system, the most likely ATT&CK tactic is "Command and Control."

Therefore, the answer is C: Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
