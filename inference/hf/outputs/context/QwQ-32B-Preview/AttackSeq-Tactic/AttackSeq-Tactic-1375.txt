Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat actor that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping victim networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they don't deploy ransomware; instead, they focus on traditional cybercrime activities.

So, the outline breaks down their activities into several MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They've been tracking FIN13 since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. FIN13 is known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents for fraudulent money transfers. They target specific industries and have a unique operational lifespan.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK to get into the network. Specific vulnerabilities aren't clear due to long dwell times and insufficient evidence.

3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and proxying network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server to listen for commands.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS process memory with ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon functionality.

7. **Credential Access**: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. They trojanize KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

8. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Additionally, there's some context about their operations having a median dwell time of 913 days, which is much longer than typical financially motivated actors. They've been operating for over five years, targeting only organizations in Mexico, and their endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions.

Now, the question is: "After employing various techniques for internal reconnaissance and gathering information on network configurations and services, which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations?"

The answer choices are:

A: Resource Development

B: Discovery

C: Lateral Movement

D: Initial Access

Okay, so I need to figure out which tactic happened before they used WMI and BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations.

First, let's understand what WMI and BUSTEDPIPE are used for. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a core Windows component that allows for system management tasks, including remote management and scripting. It's commonly used by attackers for lateral movement within a network. BUSTEDPIPE is a custom web shell mentioned in the outline, which is likely used for maintaining access and executing commands on web servers.

So, they're using WMI for lateral movement and BUSTEDPIPE for maintaining access and potentially for exfiltration or further command execution.

The question is asking about the tactic that occurred before they used these techniques for cross-platform operations. Cross-platform operations suggest that they're moving beyond just Windows environments, possibly to Linux or other systems.

Given the sequence of events in a typical cyber attack, let's map out the likely order of tactics:

1. **Initial Access**: Getting a foothold in the network, likely through exploiting vulnerabilities in external servers and deploying web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

2. **Execution**: Running malicious code on the compromised systems, using tools like JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE.

3. **Persistence**: Ensuring they can maintain access over time, using backdoors and trojanized binaries.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level permissions to access more sensitive data and systems.

5. **Defense Evasion**: Hiding their activities to avoid detection.

6. **Discovery**: Gathering information about the network and systems to plan further actions.

7. **Lateral Movement**: Moving across the network to access other systems and resources.

8. **Collection**: Gathering the data they're interested in, such as sensitive documents and credentials.

9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with compromised systems to control them and exfiltrate data.

10. **Exfiltration**: Sending the stolen data out of the network.

Given this sequence, the use of WMI and BUSTEDPIPE for cross-platform operations would most likely fall under **Lateral Movement**, as they're using these tools to move across the network and access other systems.

The question is asking which tactic occurred before they used these techniques for lateral movement. Looking at the sequence, the tactic that typically precedes lateral movement is **Discovery**. In the discovery phase, attackers gather information about the network and systems to decide which systems to target next and how to move laterally.

In the CTI outline, under **Discovery**, it's mentioned that FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

So, it makes sense that before performing lateral movement using WMI and BUSTEDPIPE, they would first conduct discovery to map out the network and identify targets for lateral movement.

Let's look at the other options to ensure that **Discovery** is indeed the correct answer.

**A: Resource Development**

This isn't a standard MITRE ATT&CK tactic. Perhaps it's a custom category in this context, but based on the outline, it's not mentioned. So, it's less likely to be the correct answer.

**B: Discovery**

As explained, this is the tactic where they gather information about the network and systems, which would precede lateral movement.

**C: Lateral Movement**

This is the tactic they're performing after discovery, so it's not what occurred before.

**D: Initial Access**

This is the first stage of the attack, where they gain entry into the network. It occurs well before lateral movement.

Given that, **Discovery** seems to be the most logical choice as it directly precedes lateral movement in the attack sequence.

However, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other tactic that might precede lateral movement.

After initial access, execution, and persistence are typically established. Then, privilege escalation might be attempted. Following that, discovery is conducted to map the network, and then lateral movement is performed to access other systems.

So, the sequence is:

- Initial Access

- Execution

- Persistence

- Privilege Escalation

- Discovery

- Lateral Movement

- Collection

- Command and Control

- Exfiltration

Given this, **Discovery** is indeed the tactic that occurs before lateral movement.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Discovery**.

**Final Answer: B**
