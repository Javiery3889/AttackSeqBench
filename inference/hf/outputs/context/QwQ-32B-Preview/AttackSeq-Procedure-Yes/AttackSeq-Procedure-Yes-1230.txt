Alright, I've got this CTI outline about some cyber attackers called Inception. They've been around since 2014 and they target different industries, mostly in Russia but also worldwide. They use a two-stage spear-phishing approach: first, they send a phishing email to gather info, and then a second one with a remote template to drop a payload.

So, in terms of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, let's see:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They do initial research and send phishing emails to gather information.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit an old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, using remote templates in Word documents. When someone opens the document, it loads an external template, which I guess is how they get their payload in.

3. **Persistence**: They set up persistence by writing a script to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and creating a run key in the registry. This means the malicious script runs automatically when the system starts.

4. **Defense Evasion**: They use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process to hide their activities and make it harder for researchers to find clues. They also use a basic backdoor called POWERSHOWER as a first stage to obscure more sophisticated payloads.

5. **Discovery**: POWERSHOWER gathers system information from the infected machine and sends it back to their command and control (C2) server.

6. **Command and Control**: POWERSHOWER communicates with the C2 server, sending data and receiving instructions. It has a loop that activates after a reboot and performs actions based on the status code of a GET request.

Now, the question is: After exploiting the Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access via remote templates in Microsoft Word, is it likely that the Inception attackers will deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to figure out the sequence of their tactics based on the information provided.

First, they send a phishing email with a Word document that has a remote template. When the victim opens the document, it loads the external template, which exploits CVE-2017-11882. This is how they gain initial access.

Next, they likely deploy some kind of payload through this exploit. According to the outline, they use POWERSHOWER, which is a PowerShell backdoor.

Then, to ensure they can maintain access even after the system restarts, they set up persistence by writing the POWERSHOWER script to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and adding a run key in the registry.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. Send phishing email with malicious Word document.

2. Victim opens the document, triggering the exploit (CVE-2017-11882).

3. POWERSHOWER payload is dropped and executed.

4. POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData% and adding a registry run key.

Given this sequence, it makes sense that they would deploy POWERSHOWER first and then set up persistence.

So, according to this, the answer should be A: Yes, they likely deploy POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence.

But let's double-check.

The outline says: "Persistence: POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry."

This suggests that POWERSHOWER is the one setting up persistence, which implies that it's already present on the system before it can set up persistence.

Therefore, the sequence is indeed:

- Deploy POWERSHOWER

- POWERSHOWER sets up persistence

So, yes, they deploy POWERSHOWER before establishing persistence.

Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
