Alright, I have this CTI outline about the FHAPPI campaign, which is some kind of advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. I need to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about what happens after the initial phishing email and the delivery of the malware.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Access:**
   - There's an APT phishing email that contains a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware is a VBScript encoded script hosted under the account 'vbiayay1'.
   - When this script is executed, it downloads a .doc file and opens it.
   - Opening the .doc file leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack, which infects the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The campaign used multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding.
   - The attack was fileless, meaning it didn't leave traces on the disk, which helps avoid known signatures.
   - The malware didn't originate from the attacker's territory, which likely helped in making the campaign more successful.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - The malware communicated with a C2 server at IP address 61.97.243.15, which is a dial-up IP in South Korea.
   - The domain for C2 communication was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.

There's also some additional information about the campaign being first recognized in Japan, the naming convention, the use of Geocities Japan for hosting, and that it targeted victims with modified PowerSploit PoC code. The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process, and there were targets in Mongolia as well.

Now, the question is: After the FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website and the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution, is it likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution?

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

To answer this, I need to look back at the CTI outline and see what it says about PowerShell and base64 encoding.

From the Initial Access section, it mentions that opening the .doc file leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy.

In the Defense Evasion section, it specifically states that the campaign utilized multiple encodings and wraps, including multilayered base64 encoding.

So, combining these two pieces of information, it seems that the PowerShell attack likely involves running base64 encoded code, given that the campaign used multilayered base64 encoding as part of its defense evasion techniques.

Furthermore, since the attack is described as fileless and avoiding known signatures, using PowerShell with encoded commands is a common tactic for malware to execute without leaving artifacts on the disk and to bypass security detections.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
