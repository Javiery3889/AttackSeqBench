To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline and see if there's any indication that TG1021 performed lateral movement by accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the relevant parts.

**Reconnaissance:**

- TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory to perform reconnaissance.

- They used SharpHound to scan and map targets by loading it directly into infected machines' memory without writing the binary on the disk.

- PowerSploit was also loaded and executed using the same technique.

**Initial Access:**

- TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.

- They used a 0-day vulnerability associated with the IIS servers.

**Execution:**

- Executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware called NodeIISWeb.

**Persistence:**

- Used web shells and a custom malware framework that operates almost entirely in-memory.

- NodeIISWeb intercepts and handles HTTP requests received by the server.

- Actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them.

**Privilege Escalation:**

- Employed various techniques, including using PotatoEx.dll, a custom version of the Potato family tools.

- Used dynamic DLL loading and execution.

- Used code injection and token manipulation functionalities provided by ExtDLL.dll.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Actively interfered with logging mechanisms.

- Evaded commercial EDRs.

- Malware operates silently and avoids generating continuous traffic.

- Removed all disk-resident tools after use.

**Credential Access:**

- Modified login webpages to record credentials and save them in clear text.

**Discovery:**

- Used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.

- Retrieved output files and deleted them after use.

**Command and Control:**

- Established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

- NodeIISWeb allows various actions on the affected host, including file and directory manipulation, system information gathering, dynamic DLL loading and execution, and code injection.

Now, the question is about lateral movement. Specifically, after performing discovery using SharpHound and PowerSploit, did TG1021 access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the lateral movement phase?

Looking at the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of lateral movement or accessing shared folders over SMB. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the information provided.

First, TG1021 has the capability to perform file and directory manipulation, as NodeIISWeb allows for this. Additionally, they have privilege escalation capabilities, which could give them higher permissions needed to access shared folders.

Moreover, since they are already compromising IIS servers and using web shells, it's possible that they could use these web shells to move laterally within the network.

However, the CTI outline does not specifically state that TG1021 accessed shared folders over SMB or dropped the NodeIISWeb loader on additional servers.

Given that, the answer should be "No," because there is no direct evidence or indication in the CTI outline that TG1021 performed lateral movement in this specific manner.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
