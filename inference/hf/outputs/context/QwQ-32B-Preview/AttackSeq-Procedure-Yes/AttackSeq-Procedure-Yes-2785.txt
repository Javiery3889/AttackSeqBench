To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and evaluate the given answer choices based on the information provided.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access**: The outline mentions that the iOS malware is part of Operation Pawn Storm and is believed to be installed on already compromised systems. It's similar to next-stage SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

2. **Execution**: The XAgent app is fully functional malware that hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7 devices. It restarts almost immediately if terminated. On iOS 8 devices, the icon isn't hidden, and it can't restart automatically, suggesting it was designed before iOS 8's release in September 2014.

3. **Discovery**: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, starts voice recordings, gets a list of installed apps, a list of processes, and the Wi-Fi status.

Now, let's look at the question:

"Is it likely that, after collecting data such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information from iOS devices, the malicious XAgent app will exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests while communicating with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification?"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine whether the XAgent app is likely to exfiltrate the collected data via HTTP requests and use a Base64 encoded token for identification with its command and control (C&C) server.

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Data Exfiltration**: The outline details the types of data the app collects but does not specify how the data is exfiltrated. However, it's common for malware to exfiltrate data via HTTP requests because HTTP is often allowed through firewalls and is a standard protocol for communication.

2. **Communication with C&C**: Malware typically communicates with its C&C server to receive further instructions or upload stolen data. Using HTTP for this communication is standard, as it's stealthy and blends in with normal traffic.

3. **Identification Token**: Using a Base64 encoded token for identification is a plausible method. Base64 encoding is a way to encode binary data into an ASCII string format, which can be useful for transmitting data over protocols that don't handle binary data well. It's also commonly used for obfuscation to avoid simple signature-based detections.

Given that the outline doesn't explicitly state how the app exfiltrates data or communicates with its C&C server, I need to rely on common malware behaviors and the context provided.

Considering that the app is designed to collect sensitive information and is part of an operation like Pawn Storm, which is known for sophisticated cyber attacks, it's reasonable to assume that the app would exfiltrate the collected data. Moreover, using HTTP for communication and a Base64 encoded token for identification aligns with common malware practices.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

A: Yes

**Final Answer: A**
