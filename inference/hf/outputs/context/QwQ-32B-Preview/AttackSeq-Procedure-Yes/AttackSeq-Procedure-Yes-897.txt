Alright, I have this CTI outline about an APT group called OceanLotus, also known as APT32, and their use of a custom downloader malware named KerrDown. The outline provides details on how they deliver this malware and some of their tactics. There's a question about the sequence of techniques they use after delivering KerrDown, and I need to choose the most plausible answer from two options: Yes or No.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. The outline starts with "Initial Access," which is the first stage where the attackers try to get a foothold in the target's environment. According to the outline, OceanLotus uses two methods for delivering KerrDown: Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros and RAR archives that enable DLL side-loading.

So, in the initial access phase, they're using social engineering to trick targets into opening these documents or archives. The RAR file names are in Vietnamese, suggesting that the targets are in Vietnam or Vietnamese speakers.

Next, under "Defense Evasion," the outline explains how KerrDown operates once it's on the target's system. It mentions that the actors reuse a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs. This suggests that some parts of the malware are encoded in base64 to evade detection.

KerrDown drops a DLL file in the AppData directory with a deceptive name, 'main_background.png,' which is likely to blend in and avoid suspicion. This DLL then retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory without writing it to the disk. This in-memory execution is a common tactic to evade traditional antivirus software that relies on scanning files on disk.

Under "Command and Control," it's mentioned that the final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is a commercial penetration testing tool often used by threat actors. The KerrDown downloader downloads the payload based on the OS architecture of the victim machine, which makes sense for ensuring compatibility.

The "Others" section provides additional context about the group's activities, such as the timeframe they've been using KerrDown and their working patterns, which seem to align with typical business hours in Vietnam or a similar timezone.

Now, moving on to the question: "After delivering KerrDown to targets via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading, is it likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture?"

I need to evaluate whether this sequence of techniques is plausible based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's break down the question:

1. Delivery mechanisms: malicious Office documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.

2. The Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

3. Base64 blobs are used to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture.

First, the outline mentions that they use Office documents with malicious macros. It's common for such documents to contain persuasive text or images encouraging the user to enable macros to view content properly or to interact with the document as intended. So, point 2 seems plausible.

Regarding point 3, the outline mentions that the actors reuse a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs. This suggests that base64 encoding is indeed part of their toolkit. Additionally, the payload is downloaded based on the victim's OS architecture, which aligns with the need to deliver compatible code.

However, the question seems to suggest that the base64 blobs are executed directly from the Office document after enabling macros. But according to the outline, the KerrDown DLL is dropped and then retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it, and executes it in memory.

So, there might be a slight mismatch here. The base64 decoding is mentioned in the context of the KerrDown DLL's operation, not necessarily in the Office document itself. But it's possible that the macros in the Office document perform some initial base64 decoding to drop the KerrDown DLL.

Given that, it's plausible that the macros in the Office document enable the execution of base64-encoded data, which could be part of the initial staging process to drop the KerrDown DLL.

Moreover, the outline mentions that the RAR archives contain legitimate programs with DLL side-loading, which is another delivery mechanism. But since the question is specifically about the Office document scenario, I'll focus on that.

Considering all this, the sequence described in the question seems consistent with the tactics outlined in the CTI report. Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

But to be thorough, let's consider why "No" might be the answer.

If "No," it would imply that the sequence described in the question is not accurate based on the CTI outline. However, given that the outline confirms the use of Office documents with macros and the use of base64 decoding in the malware's operation, there's no contradictory information to suggest that this sequence isn't plausible.

Hence, the most logical answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
