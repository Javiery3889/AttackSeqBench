Alright, I have this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about a report from Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov from March 13, 2018, focusing on cybercriminals targeting medical networks. The main part is about reconnaissance, where they use tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys to find potential entry points into these networks.

So, reconnaissance is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers gather information about their targets before launching an actual attack. In this case, the targets are medical networks, and the attackers are looking for vulnerabilities or entry points.

The report mentions that they extract IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords and use Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations. They found non-trivial ports and services, like Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication. These kinds of findings can be exploited for further reconnaissance or even direct attacks.

Additionally, the "Others" section provides some context about the threats facing medical networks, including malware infections and targeted attacks by APT groups aiming to exfiltrate data, possibly for intellectual property or business plans. The report also suggests some mitigation measures, like removing medical data from public access, keeping software updated, and not connecting expensive equipment to the main network.

Now, the question is: After identifying potential entry points into medical infrastructure using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance, is it likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery?

And the answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's think about this. The report mentions that during reconnaissance, the attackers used masscan to identify potential entry points and then used Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources. They specifically found things like Building Management systems with vulnerable protocols and printers with unprotected web interfaces.

This suggests that using these tools, they were able to discover various services running on the medical network perimeters. Moreover, the report highlights that these services include potentially outdated systems or devices that might not be properly secured.

So, the question is asking whether, given this reconnaissance activity, it's likely that various services, including outdated systems and medical devices, would be discovered.

Well, the report already provides examples of such discoveries: Building Management systems and printers with vulnerabilities. Medical devices might not be explicitly mentioned, but it's plausible that in a medical network, there could be various devices connected to the network, some of which might be outdated or have weak security.

Given that the attackers are using tools designed to discover open ports and services on the internet, it's reasonable to assume that they could find a range of services, including those that are outdated or poorly secured.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery.

But let's consider if there's any information in the outline that might suggest otherwise. The "Others" section mentions recommendations like removing medical data from public access and updating software, which implies that there are issues with outdated systems and poor security practices in medical networks. This further supports the idea that outdated systems and devices are present and could be discovered during reconnaissance.

Moreover, the statistics mentioned show that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017, indicating a prevalence of security issues, likely including outdated systems.

So, overall, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that yes, it is likely that various services, including outdated systems and medical devices, would be discovered during network service discovery as part of reconnaissance.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
