To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline and see if it supports the statement that CosmicDuke automatically uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacts live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

First, let's look at the CTI outline to understand the attack sequence and capabilities of CosmicDuke.

**Initial Access:**

- CosmicDuke infections start with deceiving victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file.

- Social engineering and document-based exploits are used.

- The document-based exploit uses a malicious Flash object in a PDF exploiting CVE-2011-0611 in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat.

**Execution:**

- CosmicDuke uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.

- The loader has a compilation date of March 24, 2011, and the most common compilation date for CosmicDuke loaders is November 13, 2012.

- The loader was updated, and CosmicDuke started using the updated loader in mid-April 2014.

**Persistence:**

- CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup' with display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'

- The service duplicates the process token of explorer.exe, reads the path of the malware binary from the registry, and starts the malware using the duplicated token.

- It copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames generated from a predefined list.

**Credential Access:**

- CosmicDuke targets multiple software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bat email client, Outlook Express, Outlook, and Google Desktop.

- It also steals Windows credentials such as LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and plain text keys for WLANs.

- Additionally, it exports certificates and associated private keys from the system store, encrypting the exported data with the password 'saribas.'

**Discovery:**

- CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including various document, archive, and other file types.

- It targets non-English filenames, particularly those containing 'sifr' and 'sifer,' related to encryption ciphers in many languages.

**Collection:**

- CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

- It also searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'

**Command and Control:**

- CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

- It uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.

- The configuration, including server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

Now, looking at the question:

"After collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase, is CosmicDuke likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase?"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if the CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke exfiltrates data via FTP using stored credentials.

From the **Command and Control** section:

- CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.

- It uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.

- The configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, which are embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

This suggests that CosmicDuke does use FTP for exfiltrating data and updating itself. Additionally, it has stored credentials for these servers, as the configuration includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials.

Therefore, it is likely that CosmicDuke automatically uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contacts live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

Given this information, the answer should be:

**Final Answer: A**
