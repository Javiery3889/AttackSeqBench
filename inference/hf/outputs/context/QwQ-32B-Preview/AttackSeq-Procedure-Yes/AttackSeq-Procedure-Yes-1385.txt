To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the context of the attack sequence described. The outline details a reconnaissance phase where cybercriminals target medical networks by identifying potential entry points using tools like masscan and specialized search engines such as Shodan and Censys. The report mentions the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, including Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

Given this information, the question is asking whether, during this discovery phase, outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online are likely to be identified.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Reconnaissance Tactics:**

   - Use of masscan to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.

   - Utilization of Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations.

   - Discovery of non-trivial ports and services, specifically mentioning Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. **Additional Context (Others):**

   - Over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017.

   - APT actors target pharmaceutical organizations using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.

   - Recommendations to remove medical data nodes from public access, update software, and avoid connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

Now, focusing on the question:

"Is it likely that outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online will be identified during the discovery phase?"

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine the most plausible answer, I need to consider whether the reconnaissance methods described would likely uncover outdated medical devices supporting MQTT and discoverable online.

Let's consider the following points:

1. **Tools Used:**

   - Masscan: A fast Internet scanner that can be used to identify open ports and services.

   - Shodan and Censys: Specialized search engines that index internet-connected devices and their properties, making it easier to find specific types of devices or services.

2. **Targets Identified:**

   - Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol.

   - Printers with web interfaces without authentication.

   - These examples suggest that the reconnaissance focuses on identifying services and devices that may have vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations or outdated protocols.

3. **Likelihood of Identifying MQTT Devices:**

   - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol often used in IoT devices, including medical devices.

   - If medical devices supporting MQTT are connected to the internet and discoverable, they would likely be identifiable using tools like Shodan and Censys, which can search for devices based on various criteria, including the protocols they use.

   - Given that the reconnaissance phase already includes searching for non-trivial ports and services, it is plausible that devices using MQTT could be discovered, especially if they are using standard ports or have identifiable signatures.

4. **Outdated Devices:**

   - Outdated devices may have known vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

   - The fact that the reconnaissance phase is aimed at identifying potential entry points suggests that identifying outdated devices would be part of the process.

Based on this analysis, it seems likely that outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online would be identified during the discovery phase, given the tools and methods being used.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

A: Yes

**Final Answer: A**
