Alright, I have this CTI outline about an attack by Shuckworm on a Ukrainian organization, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions that the attack started on July 14, 2021, with a malicious document likely delivered via phishing email. This document contained a custom backdoor called Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command. So, the initial access vector was a phishing email with a malicious document.

Next, under Execution, it says that after the initial compromise, Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor. They also created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence and executed commands via scripts. On July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed, and on July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload.

Then, under Persistence, they established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes, ensuring that their backdoor remained active even after system reboots.

Under Collection, between July 29 and August 18, they deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts. It's unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of their efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

Command and Control mentions that Shuckworm established C&C by communicating with their servers using HTTP requests and downloading additional payloads. They used various C&C servers like deep-pitched.enarto.ru, arianat.ru, and mucoris.ru to control the compromised systems and download tools.

The "Others" section provides additional context about Shuckworm, their history, and the tools they use, but it's secondary for this question.

Now, the question is: After executing malicious VBS scripts to maintain their presence and deploying their custom backdoor, is Shuckworm likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if there's any indication in the CTI outline that Shuckworm uses mshta.exe for bypassing application control solutions.

Looking back at the outline, under Execution, it mentions that they executed various VBS scripts and HTA files, created scheduled tasks, and executed commands via scripts. It also mentions that on July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed, and on July 28, a VNC client was installed.

Under Persistence, they created scheduled tasks to execute malicious VBS files.

Under Command and Control, they communicated with servers using HTTP requests and downloaded additional payloads.

Nowhere in the outline is mshta.exe mentioned. Mshta.exe is a legitimate Windows binary that can be abused by attackers to execute HTML applications, which can be a way to bypass application control solutions because it's a trusted Windows component.

Given that the outline doesn't mention mshta.exe at all, and the question is asking if they are likely to use it based on the information provided, I have to consider whether there's any indirect indication that they use mshta.exe.

The outline does mention HTA files, which are related to mshta.exe, as mshta.exe is used to run HTA files. So, there might be a connection there.

But the question specifically asks about using mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers.

Given that HTA files are mentioned, and mshta.exe is used to execute them, it's possible that Shuckworm uses mshta.exe in their operations. However, the outline doesn't explicitly state that they use mshta.exe for bypassing application control solutions.

Application control solutions can be bypassed in various ways, and using legitimate binaries like mshta.exe is one method. Since Shuckworm is described as a sophisticated threat actor, it's plausible that they would use such techniques.

But based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there's no direct evidence or mention of mshta.exe being used for this purpose.

Therefore, I would lean towards answer B: No, because the outline doesn't provide sufficient information to confirm that Shuckworm uses mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions.

However, I should consider that the outline might not include all the details of their TTPs, and that Shuckworm, being a sophisticated actor, likely employs various techniques to bypass defenses, including using legitimate binaries like mshta.exe.

But since the question is specifically asking based on the information provided in the CTI outline, and there's no mention of mshta.exe or its use for bypassing application control solutions, I think the safest answer is B: No.

It's important not to assume information beyond what's provided in the outline.

**Final Answer: B**
