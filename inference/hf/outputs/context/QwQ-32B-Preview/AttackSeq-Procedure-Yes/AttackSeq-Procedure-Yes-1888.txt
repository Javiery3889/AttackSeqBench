Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials and sensitive documents to carry out fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

So, the question is: After obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, is it likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand the sequence of tactics here. The question is about what happens after they've already obtained credentials. So, they've already gotten into the network, likely through initial access vectors like web shells or custom malware on external servers. Then, they've executed some tools to get those credentials, like dumping LSASS memory and using trojanized KeePass to log passwords.

Now, the question is asking if, after getting these credentials, they would perform system service discovery to gather information before moving laterally using WMI and custom web shells.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions anything about system service discovery. Looking back at the outline, under the "Reconnaissance" section, it says that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials. Mapping networks could involve discovering services and understanding the network topology. So, it's plausible that they perform some form of service discovery.

Under "Execution," they use tools like JSPRAT for command execution and file operations. Under "Persistence," they use various methods, including replacing KeePass binaries and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. "Privilege Escalation" mentions using ProcDump to dump LSASS memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials, which aligns with the question's premise.

"Defense Evasion" includes using passive backdoors and legitimate utilities to avoid detection. "Credential Access" specifically mentions process memory dumping and network sniffing for credentials, which again matches the question.

"Lateral Movement" is where they use WMI for remote command execution and move laterally, using tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

So, the sequence seems to be: Initial Access -> Execution -> Persistence -> Privilege Escalation -> Defense Evasion -> Credential Access -> Lateral Movement -> Collection -> Command and Control -> Exfiltration.

The question is focusing on the steps after Credential Access and before Lateral Movement. Specifically, whether they would perform system service discovery in between.

Given that they map victim networks as part of their reconnaissance, it makes sense that they would gather information on services running on the network to identify targets for lateral movement.

Looking back at the "Reconnaissance" section, it mentions that they map victim networks and capture credentials to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Mapping networks likely involves discovering what services are running on which machines, identifying high-value targets like servers containing financial data.

Additionally, under "Defense Evasion," it mentions that they use custom droppers and malware with recon functionality, like DRAWSTRING, which has recon capabilities. So, it's possible that they use such tools to gather information on services.

Moreover, in the "Lateral Movement" section, it mentions that they use WMI and custom web shells for movement across the network. Before moving laterally, knowing what services are running on different machines would help them choose the right vectors for movement and ensure they don't alert defenders by accessing unnecessary or sensitive areas.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that after obtaining credentials, they would perform some form of system service discovery to understand the network better before moving laterally.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the information in the CTI outline, it seems likely that FIN13 would gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally using WMI and custom web shells.

Hence, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
