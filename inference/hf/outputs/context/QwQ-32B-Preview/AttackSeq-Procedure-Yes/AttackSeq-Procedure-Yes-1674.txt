Alright, I've got this CTI outline from Symantec about some attacks involving WastedLocker ransomware attributed to the group Evil Corp. They used something called SocGholish, which is a JavaScript-based framework, to initially compromise victims through malicious updates on compromised websites. Then, they used Cobalt Strike and other tools to escalate privileges, evade defenses, and finally deploy the ransomware.

The question is asking whether it's likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery. So, I need to look at the attack sequence and see if this makes sense based on the information provided.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step according to the MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

**Reconnaissance:**
- Symantec identified attacks against U.S. organizations aimed at deploying WastedLocker ransomware.
- The threat actor is linked to Evil Corp.
- They used SocGholish, a malicious JavaScript framework, found on over 150 compromised websites, to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.

**Initial Access:**
- The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
- Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
- This led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, which profiled the computer and downloaded additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

**Execution:**
- Attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader.
- The loader contained a .NET injector from an open-source project called Donut, used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
- The Beacon payload could execute commands, inject processes, escalate privileges, and upload/download files.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Used a publicly documented technique involving slui.exe to escalate privileges.
- Also used wmic.exe to execute commands on remote computers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used PsExec to manage Windows Defender, disabling scanning, removing definitions, and sometimes disabling real-time monitoring.
- Used PsExec to stop services across the organization before launching WastedLocker.

**Credential Access:**
- Used Cobalt Strike for credential dumping with ProcDump and to clear log files.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.

**Command and Control:**
- The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain associated with WastedLocker.

**Impact:**
- The goal was to encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding a ransom.

**Others:**
- Symantec used machine learning and Threat Hunter team to detect and verify the activity.
- Alerted 31 customer organizations, mostly major U.S. corporations, including 11 listed companies and eight Fortune 500 companies.
- Attackers showed skill in penetrating well-protected corporations and moving laterally.
- Symantec implemented protections and reported IoCs to relevant parties.

Now, looking at the question: "Is it likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery?"

So, the sequence in question is:

1. Initial compromise using SocGholish via compromised websites.

2. Using Get-NetComputer from PowerView for remote system discovery.

First, I need to confirm if SocGholish is indeed used for initial compromise, which according to the outline, it is. It's a JavaScript-based framework delivered via compromised websites, masquerading as a software update.

Next, I need to see if PowerView and specifically the Get-NetComputer command were used in this attack.

Looking back at the outline, under "Execution," it mentions that Cobalt Strike was used, and the Beacon payload could execute commands and inject processes. However, PowerView isn't explicitly mentioned.

PowerView is a PowerShell-based reconnaissance tool that includes the Get-NetComputer cmdlet for discovering computers on the network. It's commonly used by attackers for lateral movement and discovery.

In the "Execution" phase, it's mentioned that PowerShell scripts were downloaded and executed, but it doesn't specify which PowerShell tools or scripts were used.

In the "Lateral Movement" phase, it's stated that Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.

Given that Cobalt Strike is a sophisticated tool and often used in conjunction with other tools like PowerView, it's possible that PowerView was used in this attack. However, the outline doesn't explicitly mention PowerView or Get-NetComputer.

But, considering that Cobalt Strike is capable of performing many of the same functions as PowerView, the attackers might not have needed to use PowerView separately.

Alternatively, they might have used custom PowerShell scripts for discovery rather than relying on PowerView.

So, while it's possible that PowerView was used, there's no direct evidence in the outline to confirm its use.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the information provided.

Given that the initial compromise using SocGholish is confirmed, but there's no explicit mention of PowerView or Get-NetComputer, I have to consider whether it's likely that PowerView was used for remote system discovery.

Considering that Cobalt Strike is a comprehensive tool that can perform discovery functions similar to PowerView, it's possible that PowerView wasn't used, and Cobalt Strike was sufficient for their needs.

Therefore, without explicit confirmation of PowerView's use, I would lean towards "No," it's not likely that they used Get-NetComputer from PowerView, because Cobalt Strike could fulfill those discovery roles.

Hence, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
