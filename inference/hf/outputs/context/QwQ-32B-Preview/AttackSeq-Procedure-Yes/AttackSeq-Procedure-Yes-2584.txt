Alright, I have this CTI outline here, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about a series of cyber attacks targeting Polish financial institutions. The attacks were reported by researchers at badcyber.com on 3rd February 2017. The source of the attacks is suspected to be from the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website, knf.gov.pl. The website was compromised from at least October 7, 2016, to late January, and it was altered to download malicious JavaScript files from other compromised domains: sap.misapor.ch and eye-watch.in. These JavaScript files likely led to malware being downloaded onto the visitors' devices.

The malware in question is a Win32 executable named gpsvc.exe, with an MD5 hash of 85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b. It was first seen on January 26, 2017, and it's packed with a commercial packer called 'Enigma Protector.' This packer is used for defense evasion, making it harder for security software to detect the malware. The executable can accept command-line arguments to perform various actions like listing service names, opening or setting events, and dropping or installing DLLs under specified service names. It uses an RC4 password derived from the MD5 hash of a provided password for these operations.

Under the Discovery tactic, the malware gathers a lot of system information, including the hostname, user information, system version, network configuration, and active TCP connections. This information is then sent back to the command and control (C&C) server at eye-watch.in.

Additionally, there were other watering-hole attacks observed on the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission and a state-owned bank in Uruguay, both using the eye-watch.in domain. This domain has been associated with malicious activities, including delivering malware variants and exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-0034 in Silverlight.

In the compromised website's code, there was a list of 255 IP address strings, suggesting that the attackers were filtering traffic to deliver exploits only to specific subnets, primarily targeting financial institutions in Poland and Mexico.

Now, the question is: After discovering system information such as the hostname, user details, and active TCP connections, is it likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers at IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218 using application layer protocols?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions any communication with these specific IP addresses and whether it uses application layer protocols.

First, looking back at the outline, the C&C server mentioned is eye-watch.in, which is a domain. I need to see if these IP addresses correspond to that domain or if they are mentioned elsewhere in the report.

The outline mentions that eye-watch.in has been associated with malicious activities, including delivering malware and exploits. It's likely that this domain is used for C&C communications.

But are the IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218 related to eye-watch.in? The outline doesn't directly provide the IP addresses for eye-watch.in, so I can't confirm if these IPs correspond to that domain based on the information given.

However, the question assumes that these are the C&C servers' IP addresses. So, perhaps these IPs are resolved from eye-watch.in or are part of the C&C infrastructure.

Given that, the malware is designed to send system information back to the C&C server. Since it's sending data over the network, it's likely using some application layer protocol to communicate with these servers.

Common application layer protocols used in malware C&C communications include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and sometimes more obscure protocols or custom implementations.

Given that the initial infection vector involved downloading JavaScript files and executing malware, it's plausible that the C&C communications also use HTTP or HTTPS to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

Moreover, the fact that the malware is sending system information back to the C&C server suggests that it's using some form of application layer protocol to structure and transmit this data.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the malware likely communicates with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the information provided and the reasoning above, I would choose A: Yes.

However, I should consider if there's any information in the outline that might suggest otherwise.

The outline mentions that the malware is packed with 'Enigma Protector,' which is a defense evasion technique. It also mentions that the malware executes system information gathering commands and sends the results back to the C&C server.

There's no specific mention of the protocols used for communication, but given that it's a malware communicating over the network, it's standard for such malware to use application layer protocols for C&C communications.

Moreover, the fact that the domain eye-watch.in has been used in multiple attacks and is associated with delivering malware and exploits further supports the idea that it's involved in C&C communications using standard application layer protocols.

Therefore, I see no reason to doubt that the malware communicates with the C&C servers using application layer protocols.

So, my final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
