To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any indication that Agrius deployed wipers or ransomware after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the key points related to Agrius' activities.

**Initial Access:**

- Exploiting public-facing applications

- Exploiting FortiOS CVE-2018-13379

- Attempting various 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection

- Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP

**Execution:**

- Deploying custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'

- 'IPsec Helper' used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware

- Registered as a service for persistence

- Can execute commands, upload files, and update configuration based on C2 commands

**Persistence:**

- Deploying webshells

- Registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service

**Defense Evasion:**

- Webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, some obfuscated with custom base64 encoding

- 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces

**Lateral Movement:**

- Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic

- Leveraging compromised accounts

- Utilizing publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement

**Command and Control:**

- 'IPsec Helper' communicates over HTTP

- Awaits commands such as updating relays, sending recon info, downloading files, and self-deletion

Now, the question is asking whether, after using 'IPsec Helper' to communicate with C2 servers and perform actions like updating relays or downloading files, Agrius likely deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which was later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

Looking at the CTI outline, there's no direct mention of Agrius deploying wipers or ransomware. The activities described are focused on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is described as being used for exfiltrating data or deploying additional malware, but there's no specific reference to deploying wipers or ransomware.

Given that, the answer should likely be "No", as there's no evidence in the provided outline to suggest that Agrius deployed wipers or ransomware.

However, I should consider if there's any indirect indication that might suggest the deployment of wipers or ransomware. For example, the backdoor's capability to delete traces could be misinterpreted as deploying a wiper, but the outline specifies that this is for defense evasion, not for data destruction as a primary objective.

Additionally, the fact that 'Apostle' was mentioned in the question, which was later turned into functioning ransomware, suggests that perhaps 'Apostle' is a separate piece of malware not related to 'IPsec Helper'. The outline doesn't mention 'Apostle' at all, so there's no direct connection established between 'IPsec Helper' and 'Apostle'.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it doesn't seem likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' after using 'IPsec Helper'.

**Final Answer: B: No**
