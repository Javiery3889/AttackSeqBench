To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the implications of the AtomBombing technique. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the CTI outline:

- **Execution**: On October 27, 2016, Tal Liberman authored a report revealing a new code injection technique called AtomBombing, which leverages the underlying Windows operating system mechanisms to inject malicious code and bypass security solutions.

- **Affected Systems**: This technique affects all versions of Windows, including Windows 10, and cannot be patched as it relies on the operating system's design rather than a flaw.

- **Mechanism**: AtomBombing exploits atom tables, allowing threat actors to write malicious code into an atom table and manipulate legitimate programs to execute it.

- **Impact**: This technique is particularly concerning as it can bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

Now, let's look at the question:

**Question**: After executing malicious code by exploiting atom tables in the AtomBombing technique, is it likely that threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes?

**Answer Choices**:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine whether the AtomBombing technique is likely to be used by threat actors to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

Let's analyze the information from the CTI outline:

1. **Code Injection Technique**: AtomBombing is a code injection technique that exploits atom tables in Windows.

2. **Bypassing Security Solutions**: It is designed to bypass antivirus, next-generation antivirus, and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

3. **Exploiting Legitimate Programs**: It allows threat actors to write malicious code into an atom table and manipulate legitimate programs to execute it.

From this information, it's clear that AtomBombing enables threat actors to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, which are trusted by the system and security solutions. This is a common tactic used to evade detection because the malicious activity is occurring within the context of a trusted process.

Moreover, by injecting code into these processes, threat actors can potentially bypass process-level restrictions. For example, if a process has certain privileges or access rights, the injected code can leverage those privileges to perform actions that might otherwise be restricted.

Given that the technique is designed to bypass security solutions and involves injecting code into legitimate processes, it is highly likely that threat actors would use this capability to evade detection and bypass process-level restrictions.

Therefore, the answer should be:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
