Alright, I have this CTI outline about the Longhorn group and a question related to their tactics. I need to analyze the outline, understand the question, and choose the most plausible answer from the given options.

First, let's dive into the CTI outline. It's divided into sections like Initial Access, Defense Evasion, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. There's also an "Others" section that provides additional context about the threat actor.

Starting with Initial Access:

- Longhorn group has been active since 2011.

- They use back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.

- There's a mention of a computer in the US being compromised but an uninstaller was launched within hours, suggesting an unintentional infection.

- Symantec first noticed their operations in 2014 involving a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

So, in terms of initial access, they use sophisticated methods like zero-day exploits and Trojans to gain entry into target systems.

Next, Defense Evasion:

- Longhorn follows guidelines from Vault 7 documents to avoid detection.

- They use tactics like wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, unique deployment-time keys for string obfuscation, and secure erase protocols.

- Their malware communicates externally at select times, with limits on exfiltrated data, and randomizes communication intervals to stay under the radar.

This shows that they are very careful about not being detected once they're inside the network.

Moving on to Collection:

- Their malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.

- It's designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

This suggests that once they've gained access and evaded detection, they proceed to gather as much information as possible from the target systems.

Command and Control:

- Longhorn configures specific domain and IP address combinations per target for C&C servers.

- They use privacy services to hide their real identity.

- The malware communicates over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.

This indicates that they have a structured way of maintaining control over their malware and ensuring that their communications aren't easily traceable.

Exfiltration:

- The malware communicates externally at select times with upload limits on exfiltrated data and randomizes communication intervals to avoid detection.

This aligns with their defense evasion tactics, showing a consistent approach to not drawing attention to their activities.

In the "Others" section:

- Symantec has been protecting against Longhorn's tools for three years and continues to track the group.

- Longhorn has targeted governments and internationally operating organizations across various sectors.

- Symantec has evidence of activities against 40 targets in 16 countries.

- The group uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses.

- They operate with high operational security and seem to follow a standard Monday to Friday work schedule, suggesting they're from an English-speaking, North American country.

Now, looking at the question:

"After employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion, is Longhorn likely to use its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations before engaging in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

So, I need to determine whether, after using defense evasion tactics, Longhorn is likely to use its malware for system information discovery before proceeding to fingerprinting and exfiltration.

Let's break this down.

First, the question mentions defense evasion tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation. These are methods to hide their presence and avoid detection by security systems.

Then, it asks if, after employing these tactics, Longhorn is likely to use its malware for system information discovery as part of discovery operations before moving on to detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase.

So, it's asking about the sequence of tactics Longhorn uses after initial access and defense evasion.

Looking back at the CTI outline:

- In the Collection section, it mentions that the malware is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

- The word "discovery" is mentioned in the context of collection, suggesting that discovery operations are part of the collection phase.

- Additionally, in the Exfiltration section, it mentions that the malware communicates externally at select times with limits on exfiltrated data and randomizes communication intervals.

So, it seems that discovery and exfiltration are part of the collection phase.

Now, the question is asking whether, after defense evasion, Longhorn is likely to perform system information discovery before detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration.

In other words, is the sequence:

1. Defense Evasion

2. System Information Discovery

3. Detailed System Fingerprinting

4. Exfiltration

Is this a plausible sequence based on the CTI outline?

Well, in general, in cyber-attacks, after gaining access and evading detection, threat actors usually need to understand the environment they're in before they can effectively exfiltrate data.

System information discovery would involve gathering information about the compromised system, such as what software is installed, what user accounts exist, what networks are accessible, etc.

Detailed system fingerprinting would be a more in-depth analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities or valuable data within the system.

Exfiltration would be the final step of sending the collected data out to the threat actor's servers.

So, the sequence makes sense: evade detection, discover the environment, fingerprint it for valuable data or vulnerabilities, and then exfiltrate the data.

Looking back at the CTI outline, the Collection section mentions "detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration."

This seems to suggest that discovery and fingerprinting are part of the collection phase, which follows defense evasion.

Therefore, it's plausible that after defense evasion, Longhorn performs system information discovery before detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration.

Moreover, the question specifies that these actions are part of discovery operations before engaging in the collection phase, but based on the CTI outline, it seems that discovery and fingerprinting are part of the collection phase.

There might be a slight confusion in terminology here.

In the MITRE ATT&CK framework, there are specific phases: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.

So, according to MITRE, Discovery is a separate phase that comes after Defense Evasion and before Collection.

In the CTI outline, the Collection section mentions discovery and fingerprinting, which might indicate that discovery is considered part of collection in this context.

However, based on standard MITRE phases, Discovery is a separate phase that occurs before Collection.

Therefore, considering MITRE's taxonomy, the sequence would be:

1. Defense Evasion

2. Discovery (system information discovery, fingerprinting)

3. Collection

4. Exfiltration

So, in this case, the answer should be "Yes," Longhorn is likely to use its malware for system information discovery before engaging in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase.

But, looking back at the CTI outline, it's not explicitly clear how they sequence these activities. However, given that they are engaged in espionage activities, it's logical that they would first discover the environment before fingerprinting and exfiltrating data.

Moreover, the question specifies "as part of its discovery operations before engaging in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase."

Given that, it seems to align with the MITRE phases, where Discovery comes before Collection.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes," they are likely to perform system information discovery before detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration.

So, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
