I have been given a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) outline describing a cyber attack attributed to CosmicDuke, which is related to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The outline details various stages of the attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration. Additionally, there is a question about whether CosmicDuke uses specific techniques like keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing before exfiltrating data via FTP. I need to determine the most plausible answer based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, I'll analyze the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- CosmicDuke infections start by tricking victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file.

- Social engineering and document-based exploits are used.

- The document-based exploit involves a malicious Flash object in a PDF exploiting CVE-2011-0611 in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat.

- Social engineering tactics disguise the executable as an image or document and display a decoy to distract the user while the malware installs silently.

**Execution:**

- CosmicDuke uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.

- The loader has a compilation date of March 24, 2011, predating the oldest MiniDuke sample.

- Most CosmicDuke loaders are compiled on November 13, 2012.

- The loader was updated, and CosmicDuke started using the updated loader in mid-April 2014, following MiniDuke's adoption in mid-December 2013.

**Persistence:**

- CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installing a Windows service named 'javamtsup' with display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'

- The service binary size varies but is typically 5120 bytes.

- The service interacts with explorer.exe, duplicates its process token, reads the malware path from the registry, and starts the malware using the duplicated token.

- The malware copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames generated from a predefined list.

**Credential Access:**

- CosmicDuke targets multiple software applications to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bat email client, Outlook Express, Outlook, and Google Desktop.

- It also steals Windows credentials such as LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and plain text keys for WLANs.

- Additionally, it exports certificates and associated private keys from the system store, encrypting the exported data with the password 'saribas.'

**Discovery:**

- CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives matching specific patterns, including various document, archive, and other file types.

- It targets non-English filenames, particularly those containing 'sifr' and 'sifer,' which relate to encryption ciphers in many languages.

**Command and Control:**

- CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.

- The configuration, including server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

**Exfiltration:**

- Collected information is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

- The report details login credentials used and the FTP folder structure of the remote sites contacted by CosmicDuke.

- Most of these remote sites were live at the time of writing.

Now, let's look at the question:

"After searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection, is CosmicDuke likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP?"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if CosmicDuke employs keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing as part of its information-gathering activities before exfiltrating data via FTP.

From the CTI outline, under "Credential Access," it's detailed that CosmicDuke targets various software applications to steal credentials and also steals Windows credentials, WLAN keys, and exports certificates with private keys. However, there is no explicit mention of keylogging, screenshotting, or clipboard stealing.

In the "Discovery" section, it's mentioned that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, targeting specific file types and non-English filenames related to encryption. Again, there's no mention of keylogging, screenshotting, or clipboard stealing.

The "Exfiltration" section only discusses the automatic upload of collected data via FTP but doesn't specify the methods used to collect that data.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't explicitly state that CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers, I must consider whether such capabilities are implied or typical for this type of malware based on the information provided.

MiniDuke, which CosmicDuke is related to, might have different capabilities, but the outline doesn't specify if CosmicDuke inherited those capabilities. The loader used by CosmicDuke is similar to MiniDuke's, but without explicit information about keylogging features, I cannot assume that CosmicDuke has them.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, there is no direct evidence to suggest that CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. Hence, the most plausible answer is "No."

**Final Answer: B**
