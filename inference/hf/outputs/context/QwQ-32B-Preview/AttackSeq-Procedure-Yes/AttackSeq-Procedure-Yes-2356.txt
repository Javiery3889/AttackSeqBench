Alright, I have this CTI outline about the BRONZE PRESIDENT group and a question about their tactics. Let's see.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. So, starting with Reconnaissance, it says they target NGOs, political and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia since mid-2018. They use phishing emails related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics.

Next is Resource Development. They have their own remote access tools and also use public tools. Their infrastructure is linked to entities in the PRC, and they use tools like PlugX, which is historically used by PRC-based groups.

Then, Initial Access: They likely use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files. They gain admin access to all systems in a targeted business unit and install remote access tools on many hosts.

Execution: They use various tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is installed on over 70% of accessible hosts in some intrusions, and RCSession is installed via DLL side-loading.

Persistence: They use WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain access. They create tasks like Sysdriver to periodically execute payloads.

Privilege Escalation: After compromising the network, they elevate privileges and install malware on a large number of systems. They use native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files containing password hashes.

Defense Evasion: They take steps to minimize detection, like deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution. They install malware on many hosts but exercise restraint to avoid detection.

Credential Access: They collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts. They also extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation.

Lateral Movement: They leverage Wmiexec extensively to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials.

Collection: They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to collect files into archives. They have scripts named after file extensions to collect files from specific locations.

Command and Control: Their C2 techniques vary based on the tools used. RCSession communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using a custom protocol, while ORat uses a raw socket protocol. Cobalt Strike uses malleable C2 profiles and connects to multiple C2 domains.

Exfiltration: They use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate archived data. They target specific data types and use custom scripts to create lists of files with predefined criteria for exfiltration.

Others: Secureworks has been monitoring them since mid-2018, with artifacts suggesting activity dating back to 2014. Their long-term objective seems to be monitoring target networks, and their activities suggest government sponsorship or tolerance.

Now, the question is: After BRONZE PRESIDENT elevates privileges and installs malware on systems, is it likely that the group will use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment before extensively leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the outline.

First, let's look at the Privilege Escalation section. It says that after compromising the network, they elevate privileges and install malware on a large proportion of systems. They use vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files.

Then, in Defense Evasion, they take steps to minimize detection, like deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution.

In Lateral Movement, they extensively use Wmiexec to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials.

So, the question is about whether they would use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment before using Wmiexec for lateral movement.

Let's think about this step by step.

First, Nmap is a network exploration tool and security scanner. It's used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. Ping is a basic network utility used to test connectivity to a host.

These tools are typically used in the early stages of an attack to map out the network, identify active hosts, and discover open ports or services.

In the CTI outline, under Initial Access, it mentions that they use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files to gain initial access and then install remote access tools on many hosts.

Under Lateral Movement, it specifically says they use Wmiexec extensively to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials.

However, there's no explicit mention of them using Nmap or ping for network discovery.

But, in the real world, attackers often use such tools to map the network before moving laterally. So, even though it's not mentioned in the outline, it might be plausible that they use these tools.

Wait, but the question is whether it's likely based on the information provided.

Given that the outline provides a detailed sequence of their activities, and it doesn't mention using Nmap or ping, but does mention using Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement, perhaps they don't need to use Nmap or ping because Wmiexec and net commands can provide the necessary information for lateral movement.

For example, Wmiexec can be used to enumerate processes, services, and other information on remote systems, which could help in understanding the network environment.

Similarly, net commands can be used to query network information, such as listing users, groups, and shared resources.

So, maybe they don't need to use separate tools like Nmap and ping because they can gather the necessary information using the tools they already have.

Moreover, using well-known tools like Nmap might increase their risk of detection, so they might prefer to use built-in tools that are already present on the systems they've compromised.

The outline mentions that they take steps to minimize detection, so using native tools could be part of that strategy.

Therefore, it might be less likely that they use Nmap and ping, and more likely that they rely on built-in tools for network discovery and lateral movement.

Looking back at the question: "After BRONZE PRESIDENT elevates privileges and installs malware on systems, is it likely that the group will use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment before extensively leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement?"

Given that they already have Wmiexec and net commands at their disposal, which can provide network information, and considering their focus on minimizing detection by using native tools, it seems less likely that they would use Nmap and ping.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No.

But let's consider if there's any other information in the outline that might suggest otherwise.

In Resource Development, it says they develop their own remote access tools and also utilize publicly available tools. So, it's possible that they might use publicly available tools like Nmap, but again, considering their preference for native tools and minimizing detection, it might not be the case.

Also, in Execution, they use a variety of tools, including Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is a commercial tool that includes features for network reconnaissance and lateral movement, so perhaps they could use Cobalt Strike for network mapping instead of Nmap.

Additionally, in Command and Control, Cobalt Strike uses malleable C2 profiles, which allows for greater stealth and evasion, so maybe they prefer to use Cobalt Strike's features for network discovery.

Therefore, it seems more plausible that they would use the tools they already have, such as Wmiexec, net commands, and possibly Cobalt Strike, for network discovery and lateral movement, rather than introducing additional tools like Nmap and ping.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
