To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics and techniques used in the attack. The question is asking about the sequence of events after the initial access phase, specifically whether the attack executes a PowerShell script from the internet before ensuring persistence.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack is identified as a new Cosmic Banker campaign targeting Mexican banking institutions, linked to previous attacks since March 2019 and also targeting Brazilian banking institutions. There's a connection to Banload malware, suggesting Brazilian attackers.

2. **Execution**: The attack uses a file named "COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat" which contains a batch script that executes a PowerShell script from the internet to run at the memory level. This PowerShell script downloads "md.zip," which contains the main malware library DLL, an executable loader part of the AutoIt toolkit, and other services. It also creates a random variable and a folder in the public directory, extracts files from md.zip, renames them, and creates a file with specific contents.

3. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes base64-coded text strings associated with startup persistence features, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

4. **Defense Evasion**: The main malicious file, 12.dll, is renamed with a random name and a .LNS extension, saved in the public folder, and protected with VMProtect packer to hinder static analysis.

5. **Credential Access**: The malware aims to steal bank credentials by displaying a text related to data update requests and accesses Outlook to collect email accounts from the contacts list.

6. **Collection**: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the attackers via a POST web request.

7. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.

8. **Exfiltration**: Collected email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request to a specified URL.

9. **Others**: SCILabs created a YARA rule to identify files related to the campaign, and additional malware was found with this rule.

Now, focusing on the question:

"After the delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT) in the Initial Access phase, is it likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks?"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine the sequence of events after initial access:

1. **Initial Access**: Phishing email with COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip.

2. **Execution**: The zip file likely contains the batch file "COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat," which executes a PowerShell script from the internet.

3. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script sets up persistence mechanisms, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

The question is asking if the attack executes the PowerShell script from the internet before setting up persistence.

From the CTI outline:

- The Execution phase mentions that the batch file executes a PowerShell script from the internet to run at the memory level.

- This same PowerShell script is also involved in setting up persistence features.

Given this information, it seems that the execution of the PowerShell script from the internet is followed by setting up persistence.

Therefore, the sequence is:

- Initial Access: Phishing email with zip file.

- Execution: Batch file runs PowerShell script from the internet.

- Persistence: PowerShell script sets up startup shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

Hence, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the internet before ensuring persistence.

However, to ensure accuracy, I should consider if there's any information suggesting otherwise.

Looking back at the outline, there's no indication that persistence is established before executing the PowerShell script. In fact, the persistence mechanisms are part of what the PowerShell script does.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence is that the PowerShell script is executed first, and within that script, persistence is set up.

Thus, the correct answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
