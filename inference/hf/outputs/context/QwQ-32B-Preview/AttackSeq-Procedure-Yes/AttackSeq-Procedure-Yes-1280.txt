Alright, I have this CTI outline about an attack attributed to Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. They're using some pretty specific tactics to get into systems and maintain control. My task is to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about the sequence of events in their attack.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions initial access through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. So, the attackers are sending malicious Office documents that, when opened, exploit these vulnerabilities to execute commands on the target system.

The command they execute is to download an MSI package from a specific URL and install it quietly using msiexec. So, the initial access step leads directly to installing this MSI package on the system.

Next, the outline talks about persistence. The backdoor installed by the MSI package loads and decrypts an encrypted configuration file, then uses SSL to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers. This suggests that once the MSI is installed, the backdoor is set up to maintain access and communicate with the attackers' servers.

Then, there's a section on defense evasion. It mentions that the attackers are using DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection. Specifically, they're dropping a malicious DLL, wab32res.dll, into a directory where it can be loaded by a benign executable, sidebar.exe. This is a technique to hide their malicious activity because the DLL is being loaded by a trusted system component.

Additionally, the MSI installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory and creates a hidden directory named UFile in C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\. This might be a ruse to make the activity look more legitimate or to blend in with normal system files.

The command and control section explains that the backdoor uses SSL to communicate with the C&C server, and that the C&C server and configuration values aren't hardcoded, allowing the attackers to change them easily.

In the "Others" section, there's more context about how Tropic Trooper delivers their malware using exploit-laden Office documents that appear to be job vacancies in sensitive organizations. This social engineering aspect is likely used to entice targets to open the malicious documents.

Now, the question is: After Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package, is it likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL?

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

To answer this, I need to think about the sequence of events described in the CTI outline.

First, the initial access is achieved through exploiting the Equation Editor vulnerability in Microsoft Office. This exploit allows the execution of commands on the target system, specifically to download and install the MSI package.

Once the MSI is installed, the backdoor is set up. According to the outline, the backdoor loads and decrypts its configuration file and then uses SSL to connect to the C&C servers.

The question is asking whether the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper are executed before the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C&C server.

Let's break this down:

- The malicious document is what the target opens, which exploits the Equation Editor vulnerability.

- This exploitation leads to the execution of commands that download and install the MSI package.

- The MSI package installs the backdoor, which then decrypts its configuration and connects to the C&C server.

So, the sequence is:

1. Target opens malicious document.

2. Equation Editor vulnerability is exploited.

3. Commands are executed to download and install the MSI package.

4. MSI package installs the backdoor.

5. Backdoor loads and decrypts configuration.

6. Backdoor connects to C&C server via SSL.

Given this sequence, the malicious document is executed first, which leads to the installation of the backdoor. Then, the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C&C server.

Therefore, the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper are executed before the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C&C server.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

But let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Looking back at the outline, it confirms that the initial access is through exploiting the Equation Editor vulnerabilities, leading to command execution to download and install the MSI package. The persistence is established by the backdoor after installation, which decrypts its configuration and connects to the C&C server.

There's no indication that there's any step in between these events that would change the sequence. The defense evasion techniques, like DLL hijacking, are part of the backdoor's installation and operation, but they don't alter the overall sequence of events.

Therefore, it is indeed likely that the malicious documents are executed before the backdoor establishes persistence and connects to the C&C server.

So, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
