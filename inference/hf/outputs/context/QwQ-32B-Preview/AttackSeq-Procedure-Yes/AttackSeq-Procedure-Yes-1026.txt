To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any indication that Gamaredon's malware scans all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

First, let's look at the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- Gamaredon sends spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

- They abuse compromised email accounts to send malicious emails to victims' contacts.

This tells us how they get into the network, but not directly about data collection.

**Execution:**

- They use scripting like Batch files and VBScript.

- Use rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs.

- Use CreateProcess to launch additional components.

- Rely on user execution of malicious email attachments.

This explains how they execute their malware but again, not specifics about data collection.

**Persistence:**

- Register modules as scheduled tasks.

- Use Registry Run keys and Startup folder for persistence.

- Insert malicious macros into existing documents for persistence when reopened.

This shows how they maintain access but doesn't specify about scanning all drives.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Obfuscate files and information.

- Modify registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Office related to macros.

- Use code signing with valid certificates.

- Deobfuscate and decrypt strings in modules.

- Add remote templates to documents.

This is about evading detection, not directly about data collection.

**Discovery:**

- Backdoors list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration.

This is the closest to data collection. It mentions that backdoors list interesting files, specifically Office documents, for exfiltration.

**Lateral Movement:**

- Inject malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.

- Use Outlook VBA macro to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

This shows how they move laterally within the network, but again, not specifics about scanning all drives.

**Command and Control:**

- Malware uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.

**Exfiltration:**

- Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

This indicates that they exfiltrate documents, but doesn't specify from where or what specific types beyond "harvested documents."

**Others:**

- Active since 2013, targeting Ukrainian institutions.

- Increased activity recently with constant malicious emails.

- Use various programming languages and simple tools for gathering information and spreading.

- Don't make efforts to stay under the radar; focus on quick spreading and data exfiltration.

- Use many different domains for C&C, frequently changing them.

- Install multiple scripts and executables and constantly update them, complicating defenders' efforts.

From the above, the key points related to data collection are:

1. **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration.

2. **Lateral Movement:** Inject malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.

The question is whether, as part of data collection, the malware scans all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

Let's analyze this:

- In **Persistence**, it mentions inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence when reopened. This suggests that they target existing documents to maintain access.

- In **Lateral Movement**, it says they inject malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system. The term "reachable" could imply documents on network shares as well as local drives.

- In **Discovery**, backdoors list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration.

Given that they inject macros into all reachable documents, it's plausible that they scan the file systems accessible to the compromised system, which would include network shared drives, to find documents to infect.

Furthermore, since their backdoors list interesting files for exfiltration, it's likely that they scan the file systems to identify these files.

However, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly state that they scan all drives, including network shared drives. It only says they list interesting files and inject macros into reachable documents.

But given that network shared drives are accessible to the compromised system, it's reasonable to infer that their scanning activities would encompass these drives as well.

Therefore, considering the information provided, it is likely that Gamaredon's malware scans all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
