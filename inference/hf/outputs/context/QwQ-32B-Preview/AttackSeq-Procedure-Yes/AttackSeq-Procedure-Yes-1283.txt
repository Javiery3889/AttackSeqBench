Alright, I have this CTI outline about an attack attributed to Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. They're using some pretty specific tactics, and I need to understand the sequence of events to answer this question about whether they execute a FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe and inject a malicious DLL backdoor into it.

First, I need to break down the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- They're exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.

- Through these exploits, they execute commands to download and install an .msi package from a specific URL.

So, the initial entry point is through malicious Office documents that contain these Equation Editor exploits, which allow them to run arbitrary code on the target system.

**Execution:**

- The .msi package installs some files. Specifically, it drops a backdoor installer called UserInstall.exe and then deletes itself.

- UserInstall.exe drops a normal sidebar.exe file, which is a Windows Gadget tool, a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file.

- UserInstall.exe uses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe.

- Then, the loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

Additionally, it mentions that some malicious documents don't need to download anything from the internet because the backdoor dropper is already embedded in the document.

**Persistence:**

- The backdoor loads and decrypts the configuration file.

- It uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**

- The backdoor, TClient, uses SSL to communicate with the C&C server.

- C&C server addresses and other configurations are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

- TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with a 16-byte key.

- It uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

**Others:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Office documents, often themed around job vacancies in sensitive organizations.

- The MSI file has PDB strings indicating development paths and versions.

- They use DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through a benign file (sidebar.exe) to evade AV detection.

- The backdoor's C&C information can be decrypted through reverse engineering.

- The C&C server certificate is recently registered and set to expire in a year, suggesting they use time-limited components to minimize traces.

Now, the question is: After using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, is Tropic Trooper likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process to facilitate their attack?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand what "FakeRun" is. I'm not immediately familiar with it, so I should look it up.

Upon checking, FakeRun is a technique used by some malware to load a legitimate executable and then inject malicious code into it. It's a way to execute malicious activities under the guise of a trusted process.

In the CTI outline, it describes a similar process:

- UserInstall.exe uses BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) is dropped and uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe.

- Then, the loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

So, the sequence is:

1. Exploit Equation Editor to execute commands.

2. Download and install an .msi package.

3. The .msi package drops UserInstall.exe, which in turn drops sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted config file.

4. UserInstall.exe uses BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe.

5. The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) hijacks the loading of a DLL in sidebar.exe, leading to the execution of dllhost.exe.

6. The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

Comparing this to the question:

"Execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process."

From my understanding, FakeRun is a technique to load a legitimate executable and inject malicious code into it. In this case, sidebar.exe is a legitimate Windows Gadget tool, and wab32res.dll is the malicious loader that injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

So, the sequence described in the CTI outline aligns with the FakeRun technique: launching a legitimate executable (sidebar.exe) and then injecting malicious code (via DLL hijacking) into another process (dllhost.exe).

Therefore, it seems likely that Tropic Trooper is using a FakeRun-like technique to achieve persistence and execute their malicious activities.

Given that, the answer should be A: Yes.

But I should consider if there's any information in the CTI outline that contradicts this.

Looking back, the outline explicitly mentions DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe and then injecting a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

This matches the FakeRun technique of executing a legitimate process and injecting malicious code into it.

Moreover, the outline mentions that this is done to evade AV detection, which is a common reason for using such techniques.

Therefore, there's no contradiction; in fact, it supports the notion that Tropic Trooper is using a FakeRun-like method.

Hence, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
