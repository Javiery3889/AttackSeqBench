Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the DRAGONFISH threat group and their Elise malware. It's pretty detailed, so I need to break it down step by step to answer this question correctly.

First, the outline describes the initial access vector. It says that the threat group is distributing a malicious Microsoft Word document that contains an OLE object with a malicious executable. This executable is dropped into the %temp% folder and executed by exploiting CVE-2017-11882. Then, the payload is moved to the \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ directory as NavShExt.dll, and the original executable is deleted. So, that's the initial access and execution part.

Next, under Execution, it explains that the malware starts the Internet Explorer process in a suspended state, injects NavShExt.dll into it, and calls an export function named 'Setting'. It also creates a mutex named 'donotbotherme' to prevent multiple instances from running and stores harvested data in thumbcache_1CD60.db in the AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\ directory. It also mentions that the malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14 to send data and download files and commands.

Persistence is achieved by adding a Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD in HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\. Additionally, two hidden DLLs with export functions named DePatchEntry or EvilEntry are injected into iexplore.exe to provide loading and anti-analysis functionalities.

Under Defense Evasion, the malware uses heavy anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscates data exfiltration using base64-encoded cookie values, and spoofs hosts to query non-existing domains to mislead analysts or network administrators. Also, debug paths are stripped from the malware.

In the Discovery section, it's mentioned that the malware harvests system information such as LAN and WAN IP addresses, installed software list, proxy information, process enumeration via tasklist, and a list of all files on the user's desktop.

The "Others" section provides additional context about the threat group's campaign targeting the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) and associated individuals for espionage. It also mentions that the malware can provide a remote shell and uninstall itself. Execution debug messages are stored in %temp%\FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp, and logs are encrypted with a static AES key. Mitigation steps include blocking the C2 server and installing Microsoft Security Update KB2553204 to patch the exploited vulnerability. Analysts are advised to look for specific artifacts like the IAStorD registry entry, FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp, the donotbotherme mutex, and thumbcache_1CD60.db.

Now, the question is: After Elise malware collects system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration for discovery purposes, is it likely to communicate with the hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14 using an application layer protocol for Command and Control?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to determine whether the malware, after gathering discovery information, would communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol.

From the outline, under Execution, it's明确 stated that "the payload is then moved to \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ as a file named NavShExt.dll, and the original executable is deleted." Then, it describes how the malware initiates processes, injects DLLs, and creates a mutex to prevent multiple instances.

It also says that "the malware sends data to and downloads files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server with the IP address 103.236.150[.]14." This indicates that communication with the C2 server is part of the malware's functionality.

Furthermore, under Defense Evasion, it mentions that "the malware employs various defense evasion techniques, including ... obfuscation techniques to exfiltrate data to the C2 server using base64-encoded cookie values..." This suggests that the communication with the C2 server involves encoding data in cookies, which is likely to be part of an application layer protocol, such as HTTP or HTTPS.

Given that the malware is injecting DLLs into Internet Explorer and using export functions, it's reasonable to assume that it's leveraging web-based communication channels for C2.

Additionally, the fact that it spoofs hosts to query non-existing domains suggests that it might be using domain fronting or similar techniques to hide its C2 communications within legitimate traffic.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that the malware communicates with the C2 server using an application layer protocol, probably HTTP or HTTPS, given the mention of base64-encoded cookie values.

So, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let's double-check to make sure there's no information suggesting otherwise.

Looking back at the outline, there's no mention of the malware using lower-level protocols like ICMP or DNS for C2, which are also possible but less common for this type of activity. The focus is on file operations, process injection, and communication with a specific IP address, using techniques typical of HTTP-based C2.

Moreover, the malware is designed to harvest information and send it to the C2 server, which aligns with the behavior of malware that uses application layer protocols for exfiltration and receiving commands.

Hence, there's no reason to doubt that the communication is likely to be over an application layer protocol.

Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
