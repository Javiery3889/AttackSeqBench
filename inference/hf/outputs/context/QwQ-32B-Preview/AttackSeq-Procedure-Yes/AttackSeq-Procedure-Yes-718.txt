Alright, I have this CTI outline about Operation Sharpshooter, which seems to be a cyber attack campaign. I need to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack. The question is: "After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes?" And I have two answer choices: A: Yes, and B: No.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. The outline is structured around MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which include Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Discovery, and Exfiltration. Let's go through each part step by step.

Starting with Reconnaissance: The McAfee team found that Operation Sharpshooter posed as legitimate job recruitment activity to gather information for potential exploitation. This suggests that the threat actors were gathering intelligence on their targets, possibly to identify vulnerabilities or to craft more convincing phishing messages.

Next is Initial Access: The campaign began on October 25 with malicious documents containing a Korean-language metadata and English job descriptions, targeting defense and government organizations. These documents had a malicious macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word, which then retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.

Then, Execution: The shellcode from the macro in winword.exe acted as a downloader for Rising Sun. It used functions like LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress() to resolve libraries and APIs, downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document to specific folders, and executed both payloads using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensured its persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process, so it doesn't need to set up persistence mechanisms itself.

Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information, such as network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP addresses, system information, and OS product name from the registry. It also decrypted additional information during this phase, though not all of it was used by the implant.

Exfiltration: The implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

In the "Others" section, it's mentioned that the implant has multiple backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. There's also a suggestion that it might be related to the Lazarus Group, but attribution isn't confirmed due to possible false flags.

Now, looking at the question: "After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes?"

So, the question is asking if, after the discovery phase where the implant collects system and network information, it communicates back to the control servers using HTTP POST requests for C2 purposes.

From the outline, under Exfiltration, it's stated that the Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4, obfuscated it with Base64, and exfiltrated it via HTTP POST requests. This suggests that there is communication with the control server using HTTP POST requests, and this communication likely includes both exfiltration of data and possibly receiving commands.

In the Discovery phase, the implant collects various system and network information, which it likely exfiltrates back to the attackers. Given that exfiltration is done via HTTP POST requests, it's reasonable to infer that the implant communicates with the control server using HTTP POST requests for both exfiltration and receiving commands.

Moreover, in the Execution phase, it's mentioned that the shellcode downloads the second-stage payload from the control server, which implies that there is already communication happening via HTTP POST requests at that stage.

Therefore, it's likely that after performing the discovery phase, the implant communicates with the control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the answer should be A: Yes.

To summarize:

- The implant performs discovery by collecting system and network information.

- It exfiltrates this information via HTTP POST requests.

- It likely uses the same communication channel for receiving commands.

Hence, it's probable that it communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests for C2 purposes after the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A**
