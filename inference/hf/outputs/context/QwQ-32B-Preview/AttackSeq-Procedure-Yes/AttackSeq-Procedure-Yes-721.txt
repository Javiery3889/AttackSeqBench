Alright, I've got this CTI outline about Operation Sharpshooter and the Rising Sun implant. My task is to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about whether the Rising Sun implant likely fetches computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

**Reconnaissance:**

- The operation masqueraded as job recruitment to gather information for exploitation.

- Targets were mainly defense and government-related organizations.

**Initial Access:**

- Started on October 25 with malicious documents containing a Korean-language metadata and English job descriptions.

- These documents had a malicious macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word's memory.

- The downloader then retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.

**Execution:**

- The macro's shellcode in winword.exe acted as a downloader for Rising Sun.

- It resolved libraries and APIs using LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress().

- Downloaded the second-stage payload (Rising Sun) and a decoy document to the startup folder and %LOCALAPPDATA%, respectively.

- Executed both payloads using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

**Persistence:**

- Rising Sun ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

- This setup removes the need for the implant to set up persistence separately.

**Command and Control (C2):**

- Rising Sun communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests.

- Data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

- Identified C2 servers include 34.214.99.20/view_style.php, 137.74.41.56/board.php, and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php.

**Exfiltration:**

- Data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 before exfiltration via HTTP POST.

**Others:**

- The implant framework resembles Duuzer, a 2015 backdoor targeting South Korea and Japan.

- There are similarities to Lazarus Group attacks, but attribution is uncertain due to possible false flags.

- The implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes.

Now, the question is: After ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process, is it likely that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical behavior of such implants and see if there's any indication in the outline that supports or refutes the idea that Rising Sun fetches computer name and user name information.

First, fetching computer name and user name information is a common activity for malware during the initial stages of infection. This information helps the attacker understand the environment they've compromised and can be used for further targeting or lateral movement.

Looking at the outline, under "Exfiltration," it mentions that data is encrypted and exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests. However, it doesn't specify what kind of data is being exfiltrated. Similarly, under "Command and Control," it describes how the implant communicates with the servers but doesn't detail the content of those communications.

In the "Others" section, it's mentioned that the implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. Gathering computer name and user name information could be part of "gathering drive and process information," but it's not explicitly stated.

Given that it's common for malware to collect such information and that the implant has capabilities to gather drive and process information, it's plausible that fetching computer name and user name is part of its activities.

However, the question is specifically about whether this happens "as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests."

From the outline, we know that after ensuring persistence, the implant communicates with the C2 servers. It's reasonable to assume that before or during these communications, the implant gathers some information about the compromised system to report back to the C2 server.

Moreover, the fact that the implant encrypts data with RC4 and obfuscates it with Base64 before exfiltration suggests that it's preparing data to be sent, but again, it doesn't specify what data is being sent.

Given the backdoor capabilities listed, which include executing commands and gathering information, it's likely that fetching computer name and user name is among the actions performed.

Therefore, considering the common practices of malware and the capabilities described for Rising Sun, the answer is probably "Yes."

But let's consider if there's any reason to think otherwise. The outline doesn't explicitly mention gathering computer name or user name, but as I said, it's a common practice, and the implant has broad capabilities that suggest it can gather various types of information.

Additionally, the fact that the implant ensures persistence before these actions suggests that it wants to ensure it remains on the system before conducting further activities, which would include gathering information and communicating with the C2 server.

Therefore, it's logical to conclude that fetching computer name and user name information is part of its discovery activities before communicating with the C2 servers.

So, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
