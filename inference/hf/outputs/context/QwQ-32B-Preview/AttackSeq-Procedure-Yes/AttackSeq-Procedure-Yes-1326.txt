To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if it mentions anything about CosmicDuke searching removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts, which would correspond to the "Data from Removable Media" technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the relevant sections. The outline is divided into several MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Discovery, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. The question is specifically about the Discovery phase and whether CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files.

Looking at the Discovery section of the CTI outline:

"Discovery: CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including various document, archive, and other file types. It also targets non-English filenames, particularly those that include the words 'sifr' and 'sifer,' which are related to encryption ciphers in many languages."

From this, we can see that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives. However, there is no explicit mention of removable drives in this section.

Now, I need to consider whether removable drives are included in the term "hard drives" or "network drives." Hard drives typically refer to internal or external storage devices that are permanently connected or mounted to the system, while network drives refer to shared resources accessible over a network. Removable drives, such as USB flash drives, are distinct and are usually mounted temporarily when connected.

Given that the outline specifies "hard drives and network drives," and does not mention removable drives separately, it is reasonable to assume that removable drives are not included in these categories. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

However, to be thorough, I should check other sections of the CTI outline to see if there is any indirect reference to removable drives or behavior that could imply such activity.

Looking at the Initial Access section:

"Initial Access: CosmicDuke infections begin by deceiving victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file. The attackers utilize social engineering and document-based exploits to achieve this. The document-based exploit involves a malicious Flash object embedded in a PDF file that exploits the CVE-2011-0611 vulnerability in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat products. Social engineering tactics involve disguising the executable file as an image or document and displaying a decoy document or image to distract the user while the malware installs silently in the background."

This section describes how CosmicDuke is initially delivered and installed on a system but does not mention anything about searching removable drives.

Next, the Execution section:

"Execution: The CosmicDuke samples analyzed use the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples. This loader was first seen with a compilation date of March 24, 2011, predating the oldest documented MiniDuke sample. The most common compilation date for loaders that load the Cosmu malware is November 13, 2012. The MiniDuke loader was updated, and CosmicDuke samples began using the updated loader in mid-April 2014, a few months after MiniDuke started using it in mid-December 2013."

This section discusses the malware's execution mechanisms but again, no mention of removable drives.

Persistence:

"Persistence: CosmicDuke achieves persistence on the system by creating a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installing a Windows service with the name 'javamtsup' and the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' The service binary's size on disk varies, but typically the real size is 5120 bytes. The service opens a handle to the explorer.exe process, duplicates its process token, reads the path of the actual malware binary from the registry, and starts the malware using the duplicated token. The malware copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames generated by combining two items from a predefined list."

Again, no reference to removable drives.

Credential Access:

"Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets a variety of software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bat email client, Outlook Express, Outlook, and Google Desktop. It also steals Windows credentials such as LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and plain text keys for WLANs. Additionally, it exports certificates and associated private keys from the system store using the password 'saribas' to encrypt the exported data."

This section details the malware's efforts to steal various types of credentials but does not mention anything about removable drives.

Command and Control:

"Command and Control: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware. The configuration, which includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1."

This section describes how the malware communicates with its C2 servers and exfiltrates data but does not mention removable drives.

Exfiltration:

"Exfiltration: The information collected by CosmicDuke is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP. The report details the login credentials used and the FTP folder structure of the remote sites contacted by CosmicDuke. Most of these remote sites were live at the time of writing."

Again, no mention of removable drives.

Given that the CTI outline does not explicitly mention removable drives in the Discovery section or elsewhere, and considering that hard drives typically refer to fixed or external storage and network drives refer to shared network resources, it is reasonable to conclude that CosmicDuke does not search removable drives for files as part of its collection efforts.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

"Final Answer: B: No"
