Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. So, they're in it for the data that can help them make illegal transactions.

First, I need to understand their attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with Reconnaissance: They've been tracked since 2017, but activities date back to 2016. They target specific industries in Mexico, which suggests they might have some knowledge or interest in the financial systems there. They're patient, with a median dwell time of 913 daysâ€”that's over two and a half years. That's really unusual, especially for cybercriminal groups, who usually cash out faster.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities they use aren't clear because of their long dwell times and lack of evidence. So, they might be using known vulnerabilities or zero-days; we don't know for sure.

Execution: They use JSPRAT, which allows them to execute commands, upload and download files, and proxy network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ports to listen for commands.

Persistence: They have multiple methods for maintaining access. They replace legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords. They use malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. Also, they use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

Privilege Escalation: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS memory with tools like ProcDump and then using Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with reconnaissance functionality.

Credential Access: They use process memory dumping, network sniffing, and target unsecured credentials. The trojanized KeePass is a clever way to log new passwords as they're entered.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to map the network and gather information about the environment, which helps them achieve their objectives.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally. They have custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE and also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Command and Control: They use various methods for C2, including proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After leveraging WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement across networks, is it likely that FIN13 will collect sensitive data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive the collected data before targeting specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's consider their objectives. They're after sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. So, they need specific types of data that can help them perform financial fraud.

Given that, it makes sense that they would collect sensitive data from network shared drives. Shared drives are likely to contain a wealth of information, including financial records, customer data, and other documents that could be useful for their purposes.

Now, staging the data locally or remotely makes sense for a few reasons. First, it allows them to consolidate the data they've collected, making it easier to manage and analyze. Second, it might be more efficient to archive and exfiltrate the data in a structured way rather than grabbing files haphazardly.

Archiving the collected data also makes sense because it allows them to compress the data, reducing the size for exfiltration, which could be important if they're dealing with bandwidth limitations or wanting to minimize the time spent exfiltrating data.

Finally, targeting specific information from the archived data would be the logical next step. Once they have a large collection of data, they can sift through it to find the most valuable pieces that will help them carry out fraudulent transactions.

Looking back at the CTI outline, there are a few points that support this sequence of actions.

Under Exfiltration, it's mentioned that they exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions. This suggests that they do indeed collect and exfiltrate specific data that is useful for their fraudulent activities.

Also, under Discovery, it's stated that they gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives. This implies that they are looking for specific types of data within the network.

Furthermore, under Credential Access, they use various methods to obtain credentials, which are likely used to access sensitive areas of the network where the desired data is stored.

Given all this, it seems plausible that after gaining lateral movement across the network using WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE, they would proceed to collect sensitive data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, archive it, and then target specific information for their fraudulent transactions.

But let's consider if there's any information in the CTI outline that might suggest otherwise.

Under Others, it's mentioned that their operations have a long dwell time, averaging 913 days, which is much longer than typical financially motivated actors. This suggests that they're not in a hurry and can take their time to navigate the network, collect data, and plan their actions carefully.

They also have a rare operational lifespan of over five years, focusing only on organizations in Mexico. This dedication to specific targets over a long period indicates a high degree of specialization and knowledge about their target environment, which would further support the idea that they methodically collect and analyze data to carry out their fraud.

Additionally, they're described as processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. This suggests that they're dealing with payment card data, which is often stored on network shared drives or accessible via lateral movement across the network.

Therefore, based on their objectives and the tactics they employ, it's reasonable to conclude that they would engage in the sequence of actions described in the question.

So, the answer should be A: Yes.

But to be thorough, let's consider why B: No might not be the correct answer.

If I were to choose B: No, I would need to find reasons why FIN13 wouldn't collect sensitive data from network shared drives, stage it, archive it, and then target specific information for fraudulent transactions.

However, given their objectives and the tactics they use, it's hard to see why they wouldn't follow this sequence. Collecting data from shared drives is a logical step if you're trying to gather as much sensitive information as possible.

Staging and archiving the data makes sense for organizational and exfiltration purposes. And targeting specific information from the archived data is efficient, as it allows them to focus on the most valuable data for their fraud operations.

Therefore, there doesn't seem to be a valid reason to choose B: No.

In conclusion, based on the CTI outline and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described for FIN13, it is likely that they would collect sensitive data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, archive the collected data, and then target specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions after gaining lateral movement across networks using WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE.

Final Answer: A
