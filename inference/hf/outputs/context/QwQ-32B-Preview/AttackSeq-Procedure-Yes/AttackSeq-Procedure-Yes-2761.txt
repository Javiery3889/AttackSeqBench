I've got this CTI outline about a cyber attack involving MoonBounce, a UEFI firmware-level compromise. It's pretty detailed, so I need to break it down step by step to answer the question about whether MoonBounce operates entirely in memory to evade detection before gaining lateral movement within the network.

First, let's analyze the CTI outline.

**Initial Access:**

- Kaspersky's Firmware Scanner detected a UEFI firmware-level compromise at the end of 2021.

- Attackers modified a component within the firmware's image to intercept the machine's boot sequence and introduce an infection chain.

- The malicious code is named MoonBounce, embedded in the SPI flash on the motherboard.

- It persists across disk formatting or replacement.

**Execution:**

- MoonBounce is incorporated into the CORE_DXE component of the UEFI firmware.

- CORE_DXE is called early in the boot sequence and initializes essential data structures and function interfaces, including the EFI Boot Services Table.

- Attackers set hooks to intercept functions like AllocatePool, CreateEventEx, and ExitBootServices, diverting them to malicious shellcode appended to the CORE_DXE image.

- This facilitates the propagation of malicious code to other boot components and introduces a malicious driver into the Windows kernel's memory address space.

**Persistence:**

- Due to its placement on the SPI flash, MoonBounce persists across disk formatting or replacement.

- Indicates the attackers' aim to establish a longstanding foothold within the network.

**Lateral Movement:**

- After gaining a foothold, attackers executed commands to move laterally and exfiltrate information.

- Aligns with APT41's previous operations, including supply chain interventions and theft of sensitive intellectual property and personally identifiable information.

**Command and Control:**

- User-mode malware deployed by MoonBounce reaches out to a hardcoded C&C URL to fetch another stage of the payload to run in memory.

- ScrambleCross, another non-UEFI implant, communicated with the same infrastructure hosting the stager's payload.

**Exfiltration:**

- Attackers enumerated hosts and gathered network information.

- Copied files across SMB shares and attempted to dump the Active Directory domain database.

- Used tools like Sysinternals Psexec for remote command execution and WMI for remote command execution to exfiltrate data.

**Others:**

- MoonBounce is attributed to APT41, a Chinese-speaking threat actor.

- The attack was highly targeted, with firmware rootkit detected in a single case and other affiliated malicious samples found on multiple machines in the same network.

- Attackers maintained infrastructure from at least March 2020, with servers still active at the end of 2021.

- The group continues to be active despite legal proceedings and maintains a high level of proficiency in developing its toolset.

- Vendors are taking precautions against UEFI threats, such as enabling Secure Boot by default.

- Recommendations include updating UEFI firmware regularly, enabling BootGuard and Trust Platform Modules, and using security products with firmware image visibility.

Now, the question is: After securing a foothold in the victim's system through a UEFI firmware-level compromise and tampering with the CORE_DXE component for execution, is MoonBounce likely to operate entirely in memory to evade detection before gaining lateral movement within the network?

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to understand the behavior of MoonBounce post-execution and whether it operates solely in memory to avoid leaving traces on disk, thereby evading detection.

From the outline:

- MoonBounce is embedded in the UEFI firmware, specifically in the CORE_DXE component.

- It intercepts the boot sequence and introduces an infection chain.

- It hooks into various EFI functions to divert control flow to malicious shellcode appended to the CORE_DXE image.

- This allows the propagation of malicious code to other boot components and introduces a malicious driver into the Windows kernel's memory address space.

- User-mode malware deployed by MoonBounce reaches out to a hardcoded C&C URL to fetch another stage of the payload to run in memory.

- ScrambleCross, another non-UEFI implant, is also present and communicates with the same C&C infrastructure.

Given this information, it seems that MoonBounce operates at the firmware level and introduces malicious code into the kernel's memory address space. Additionally, it deploys user-mode malware that communicates with a C&C server to fetch further payloads, which also run in memory.

However, the presence of ScrambleCross, described as a non-UEFI implant, suggests that there are components operating beyond just memory. Non-UEFI implants typically reside on the file system, which means they have a persistent presence on disk.

Moreover, the outline mentions that MoonBounce persists across disk formatting or replacement due to its placement on the SPI flash. This indicates a firmware-level persistence mechanism.

Regarding lateral movement, the attackers used tools like Psexec and WMI, which are common for moving laterally within a network. These tools can be executed from memory, but they can also be deployed via scripts or executable files on the file system.

Given that there are components like ScrambleCross that are not purely in memory and the fact that lateral movement tools can be deployed in various ways, it's unlikely that MoonBounce operates entirely in memory to evade detection before gaining lateral movement.

Therefore, the answer is:

B: No

**Final Answer: B**
