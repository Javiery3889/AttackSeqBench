I have a CTI outline that describes an attack by a threat actor called Earth Lusca. The outline details various stages of the attack mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, lateral movement, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.

The question is about whether, after using spear phishing and malicious JavaScript in watering hole attacks for initial access and deploying a Cobalt Strike loader disguised as a system update service, it's likely that Earth Lusca will use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase.

I need to evaluate this based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

**Reconnaissance:**

- Used Windows utilities like 'net,' 'nltest,' 'ipconfig,' 'netstat,' 'tasklist' to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.

- Also used third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit.

- Specifically mentioned using PowerView to discover machines in the same domain.

**Initial Access:**

- Employed spear phishing and watering hole attacks.

- Exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.

- Sent spear phishing emails with malicious links leading to LNK files or executables.

- Compromised websites or created fake pages with injected JavaScript for watering hole attacks.

**Execution:**

- Used command and scripting interpreters.

- Deployed containers.

- Scheduled tasks/jobs to run malicious code.

- Example: Created a service using 'sc create' to launch a Cobalt Strike loader.

**Persistence:**

- Used account manipulation, BITS jobs, creating accounts, modifying system processes, and external remote services.

- Created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts.

**Privilege Escalation:**

- Abused elevation control mechanisms.

- Created or modified system processes.

- Hijacked execution flow.

- Example: Used registry modifications to bypass UAC and gain elevated privileges.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Used various techniques to avoid detection, including abuse of elevation control mechanisms, BITS jobs, deobfuscating/decoding files, deploying containers, hiding artifacts, hijacking execution flow, impairing defenses, modifying the registry, and using signed binary proxy execution.

- Leveraged valid code-signed executions and employed obfuscation techniques.

**Credential Access:**

- Targeted user credentials.

- Used procdump to dump lsass process memory for credential hashes.

- Exploited domain controllers using ZeroLogon exploit and Mimikatz.

**Lateral Movement:**

- Exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.

- Transferred tools and established network tunnels using proxy tools like lcx and frp.

**Collection:**

- Collected data from local systems and network shared drives.

- Captured email and screen data.

- Used WinRAR to compress files and megacmd to upload to Mega service for exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**

- Used various communication methods including application layer protocols, data obfuscation, encrypted channels, non-standard ports, protocol tunneling, proxies, and remote access software.

- Established C&C servers and mimicked normal traffic to avoid detection.

**Exfiltration:**

- Compressed files into archives and used megacmd to upload to cloud accounts.

- Used C2 channels for data exfiltration, packaging data to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about whether Earth Lusca is likely to use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase, given their initial access and execution methods.

First, I need to understand which phase "discovery phase" corresponds to in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It seems to align with the "Discovery" subtechnique under the "Discovery" tactic, which is part of the broader "Reconnaissance" category.

Looking back at the reconnaissance phase in the CTI outline, Earth Lusca used Windows utilities like 'net,' 'nltest,' 'ipconfig,' 'netstat,' 'tasklist,' adfind, and PowerSploit (specifically PowerView) for gathering information.

Now, the question is about whether they would use additional tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery.

HUC Port Banner Scanner is a tool used to scan ports and retrieve banner information, which can help identify services running on those ports.

Nbtscan is a tool used to query NetBIOS over TCP/IP names and get IP addresses of hosts in the network.

Fscan is another network scanning tool that can be used for port scanning and service discovery.

Given that Earth Lusca already used PowerView, which is a part of PowerSploit and is very powerful for Active Directory enumeration and network discovery, it's possible that they might not need additional tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, or fscan, as PowerView can provide a lot of the same information.

However, threat actors often use a combination of tools based on the environment and the specific information they need. So, it's not impossible that they would use these additional tools.

But the question is whether it's "likely" based on the information provided.

Looking at the CTI outline, Earth Lusca demonstrated a preference for using PowerShell and existing Windows utilities, as well as some third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit.

Given that PowerView is part of PowerSploit and is designed for network discovery, including enumerating computers, users, shares, etc., it seems that they had the necessary tools for discovery.

Moreover, the outline doesn't mention the use of HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, or fscan. These are not commonly mentioned in the context of PowerShell-based attacks, and they are not part of the tools already listed in the reconnaissance phase.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it doesn't seem likely that Earth Lusca would use these specific tools for network service discovery, especially since they had more sophisticated tools like PowerView at their disposal.

Hence, the answer is "No."

**Final Answer: B**
