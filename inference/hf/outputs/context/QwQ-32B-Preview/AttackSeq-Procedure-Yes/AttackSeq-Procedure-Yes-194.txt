To answer this question, I need to analyze the provided CTI outline and determine the most plausible sequence of tactics and techniques used by the threat actor, FamousSparrow. The question specifically asks about the likelihood of SparrowDoor communicating with a C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel after initial access and execution.

First, let's break down the information from the CTI outline:

1. **Resource Development**: FamousSparrow exploited known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples. They acquired infrastructure from various hosting providers.

2. **Initial Access**: They gained initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in the mentioned applications.

3. **Execution**: They used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing SparrowDoor backdoor, and exploited the same vulnerabilities to execute it.

4. **Persistence**: They created a registry Run key entry and installed SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex. They also used DLL search order hijacking to load a malicious DLL.

5. **Defense Evasion**: They injected encrypted shellcode into processes, attempted to adjust token privileges, and obfuscated files and information.

6. **Credential Access**: They used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.

7. **Discovery**: SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files in specified directories.

8. **Collection**: They could read and exfiltrate file contents.

9. **Exfiltration**: Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

Now, focusing on the question: "After exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access and running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor for Execution, is it likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control?"

Let's consider the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine the most plausible answer, I need to look for indications in the CTI outline about how SparrowDoor communicates with its C&C server.

From the outline:

- "They used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor."

- "SparrowDoor collected system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types. It also probed files in specified directories to obtain their names, attributes, sizes, and last modified times."

- "FamousSparrow exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor."

While the outline mentions that data is exfiltrated over the C&C channel, it does not specify the protocol used for communication. However, it's common for malware to use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to evade detection and ensure the confidentiality of their commands.

Given that FamousSparrow employed various defense evasion techniques, such as injecting encrypted shellcode and obfuscating files, it is plausible that they would also use an encrypted channel for C&C communication to further evade detection by security solutions.

Moreover, using HTTPS for C&C communication is a common practice among malware authors because HTTPS traffic is difficult to distinguish from legitimate web traffic, making it harder for network-based defenses to identify and block malicious communications.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical behaviors of malware, it is likely that SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel.

**Final Answer: A**
