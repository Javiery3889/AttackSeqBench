To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline provided and see if there's any indication that Gamaredon group deploys scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement.

First, let's look at the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- Gamaredon sends spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.

- They abuse compromised email accounts to send malicious emails to victims' contacts.

**Execution:**

- They use scripting like Batch files and VBScript.

- Use rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs.

- Use CreateProcess to launch additional components.

- Initial compromise requires user execution of malicious email attachments.

**Persistence:**

- Register modules as scheduled tasks.

- Use Registry Run keys and Startup folder for persistence.

- Insert malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Use obfuscated files and information.

- Modify registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office related to macros.

- Use code signing with valid certificates.

- Deobfuscate and decrypt strings in their modules.

- Add remote templates to documents sent to targets.

- C# compiler module contains an obfuscated downloader compiled and executed using csc.exe.

**Discovery:**

- Backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration.

**Lateral Movement:**

- Inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.

- Use Outlook VBA macro to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.

**Command and Control:**

- Malware uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.

**Exfiltration:**

- Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Others:**

- Active since at least 2013, targeting Ukrainian institutions.

- Increased activity recently with constant malicious emails.

- Use various programming languages and simple tools for gathering sensitive information and spreading.

- Do not make efforts to stay under the radar; focus on quick spreading and data exfiltration.

- Use many different domains for C&C, both free and paid, frequently changing them.

- Use separate domains for small groups of victims.

- Despite tool errors, their rapid execution and adaptation cause distress to targets.

- Persistence techniques include scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys, and Startup folder.

- Install multiple scripts and executables on each system and constantly update them, complicating defenders' efforts.

Now, focusing on the question:

"After Gamaredon uses its Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets, is it likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities?"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

From the CTI outline, under the "Discovery" section, it is mentioned that:

"The group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration."

This suggests that once the backdoors are in place, they automatically scan for sensitive documents.

Additionally, under "Exfiltration":

"Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server."

This indicates that there is an automated process for identifying and uploading sensitive documents.

Given that lateral movement is achieved through the Outlook VBA macro, which is part of their infection chain, it is reasonable to assume that once lateral movement is accomplished, the same or similar modules would be deployed on the new systems, including those that scan for sensitive documents.

Moreover, the persistence mechanisms include scheduled tasks and registry keys that ensure modules run at every reboot, which could include scanning scripts.

Therefore, it is likely that after lateral movement, Gamaredon would deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

Hence, the answer should be:

**Final Answer: A**
