To answer this question, I need to analyze the provided CTI outline and see if it aligns with the sequence of events described in the question. The question is about whether, after reconnaissance activities, it's likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control (C2) servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

First, let's look at the CTI outline step by step.

**Reconnaissance:**

- Adversaries conduct open-source intelligence gathering and reconnaissance on potential targets.

- They gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture.

- They may use active discovery methods such as scanning perimeter devices, enumerating devices, and collecting social media data for future targeting.

This matches the "reconnaissance activities" mentioned in the question.

**Initial Access:**

- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.

- They send targeted emails containing modified MS Office files as attachments to users on targeted networks.

- Employees open these attachments and enable macros, which install the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

This aligns with the question's mention of "employee-enabled macro execution" leading to the installation of malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3.

**Command and Control:**

- After installation, the malware establishes a connection from the implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server.

- This connection is established via HTTP requests.

This directly corresponds to the question's query about whether the malicious implants will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed.

Given this sequence:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information and conducting active discovery.

2. Initial Access: Phishing campaign with malicious attachments, leading to macro execution and installation of BlackEnergy 3.

3. Command and Control: Malware establishes connection to C2 server.

It's clear that after the reconnaissance and initial access phases, the malicious implants do establish communication with C2 servers.

Therefore, the answer to the question is "Yes," it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with C2 servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Final Answer: A**
