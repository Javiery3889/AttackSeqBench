To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of events described in the attack. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the CTI outline mentions that the campaign involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The specific file mentioned in the question is 'Richard_Johnson.doc', which aligns with the general description in the outline. So, the initial access vector is indeed phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

Next, the outline describes what happens upon opening the malicious Word document: a VBS macro executes, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This PowerShell script then downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

So, the sequence is:

1. Phishing email with malicious Word document.

2. User opens the document.

3. VBS macro executes.

4. Macro runs an encoded PowerShell script.

5. PowerShell script downloads and executes malware payloads.

Given this sequence, the question is asking if it's likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the CTI outline, the answer should be "Yes" because the outline explicitly states that upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro executes. Therefore, it is likely that the campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after the initial access through the phishing email.

However, to ensure there are no misinterpretations, let's consider if there are any factors that might suggest otherwise.

First, the outline mentions that the campaign uses phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. This implies that the documents are designed to contain and execute macros.

Second, the outline specifies that upon opening the document, a VBS macro executes. This directly confirms that macros are indeed executed as part of the attack sequence.

Third, the outline doesn't mention any conditions or alternatives where macros might not be executed. It presents a straightforward sequence where opening the document leads to macro execution.

Therefore, there is no reason to doubt that the campaign is likely to execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after initial access through the phishing email.

In conclusion, the correct answer is "Yes."

Final Answer: A
