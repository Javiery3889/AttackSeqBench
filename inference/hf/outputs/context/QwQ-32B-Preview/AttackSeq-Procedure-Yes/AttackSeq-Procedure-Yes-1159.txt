To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline provided and see what it says about the exfiltration process used by the PROMETHIUM threat actor.

First, let's look at the "Collection" section of the CTI outline:

"Collection: The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files found on the system. It uses a document search module to parse the hard drive for files with specific extensions, compresses them into an archive, and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server."

From this, we can see that after searching for and compressing the files, the malware encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server. The question is asking whether the malware encodes the archives with an "unusual scheme" and splits them into chunks before exfiltration.

The CTI outline mentions that the archive is encoded before sending it to the C2 server, but it doesn't specify the encoding scheme used. The term "unusual scheme" is subjective and not defined in the outline, so I can't definitively say whether the encoding scheme is unusual or not based on the information provided.

Additionally, the outline doesn't mention anything about splitting the archives into chunks. So, based on the information given, I can't confirm that the malware splits the archives into chunks before exfiltration.

Given that, let's look at the question again:

"After PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module during the Collection phase, is it likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase?"

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the CTI outline, we know that the malware encodes the archives before sending them to the C2 server, but it doesn't specify the encoding scheme or whether the archives are split into chunks.

Since the outline doesn't provide details about the encoding scheme being unusual or about splitting the archives into chunks, I cannot confirm these actions. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to choose "Yes" as the answer.

Hence, the most appropriate answer is "No", because the CTI outline does not provide sufficient information to confirm that the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
