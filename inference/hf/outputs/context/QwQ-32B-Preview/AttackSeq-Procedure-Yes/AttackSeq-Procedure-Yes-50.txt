Alright, I've got this CTI outline here, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign that starts with reconnaissance and phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded macros. These macros, when executed, lead to the download and execution of malicious payloads like Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The attack is designed to evade defenses by operating in memory and using specific techniques to execute files without writing to the disk.

Now, the question is: "After evading defenses by operating in memory and using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk, is it likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware?"

And the answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

Okay, so I need to determine whether, after employing these defense evasion techniques, the PowerShell script would communicate with command and control (C2) servers to download Ursnif and GandCrab.

Let's look back at the CTI outline to find relevant information.

In the "Execution" section, it says: "Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script would then download and execute payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab malware."

And in the "Defense Evasion" section: "The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk."

So, from this, it's clear that the PowerShell script is designed to download payloads from somewhere and execute them directly in memory without writing to the disk, using the specified DCOM object.

Now, the question is asking if, after performing these evasion techniques, it's likely that the script will communicate with C2 servers to download Ursnif and GandCrab payloads.

Well, according to the outline, that's exactly what the script is designed to do: download and execute payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.

Moreover, the use of the .Net WebClient class suggests that it's capable of making network requests to download these payloads.

So, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it seems highly likely that the PowerShell script would communicate with C2 servers to download these payloads.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

But let's consider if there's any reason to choose "No."

If I think about it, maybe the script could have the payloads encoded within itself and doesn't need to communicate with C2 servers to download them. However, the outline specifically says that the script "downloads and executes payloads," which implies that it does communicate with external servers to get these payloads.

Additionally, the use of the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk suggests that the files are being fetched from elsewhere, likely from C2 servers.

So, there doesn't seem to be any justification for choosing "No."

In conclusion, based on the CTI outline, it's highly likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers to download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Final Answer: A**
