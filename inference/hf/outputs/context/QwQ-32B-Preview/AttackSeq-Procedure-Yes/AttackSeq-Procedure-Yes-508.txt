To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline provided and understand the sequence of events in the CostaRicto Campaign, particularly focusing on the tactics related to Command and Control (C2) and potential data exfiltration.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
   - SSH tools were used for remote tunneling, redirecting traffic from malicious domains to a local proxy using the attackers' private keys.
   - Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed via scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

2. **Execution:**
   - Malicious code was executed through various methods.
   - A 64-bit backdoor was deployed using scripts and encrypted files, with a PowerShell loader injecting a payload DLL into memory.
   - A 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader called CostaBricks to decode and inject the payload.

3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Techniques included process injection using PowerSploit modules and deobfuscation to decode SombRAT backdoor-related files or information.

4. **Discovery:**
   - The SombRAT backdoor had capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
   - Tools like pscan and nmap were used for network service scanning.

5. **Collection:**
   - Collected data was archived using a custom storage file format.

6. **Command and Control:**
   - The SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
   - Traffic was SSL-encrypted and could bypass HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
   - The C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
   - RSA encryption was used to secure the AES key exchange for C2 traffic.
   - Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were also used.

Now, let's look at the question:

"After the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, is it likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine whether, given the established C2 communication methods, the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel.

Let's consider the following points:

- The SombRAT backdoor has established C2 communication using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL encryption and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

- The communication is secure and likely designed to evade detection.

- The backdoor has capabilities for data collection, as mentioned in the "Collection" section, where collected data is archived using a custom storage file format.

Given that the backdoor has both data collection capabilities and a secure C2 communication channel, it is logical to assume that the exfiltration of collected data would occur over this same channel. This is a common practice in malware operations to maintain consistency and efficiency in communication.

Furthermore, the use of SSL encryption and RSA-secured AES key exchanges indicates that the attackers have implemented robust security measures to protect the C2 communications, which would also cover any data exfiltration activities.

Therefore, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel using the established SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

Thus, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
