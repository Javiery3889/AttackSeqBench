Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. So, they're in it for the money, but they're patient and stealthy, staying in networks for a really long timeâ€”like over two years on average.

First, I need to understand their attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with Reconnaissance: They've been tracking FIN13 since 2017, but activities go back to 2016. They target specific industries in Mexico and have been at it for over five years, which is pretty rare. So, they do their homework, focusing on these sectors because they likely have valuable financial data.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. It's mentioned that specific vulnerabilities aren't clear due to long dwell times and lack of evidence. But, web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

Execution: Once in, they use JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and proxying network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ports to listen for commands.

Persistence: They use various methods to maintain access, like replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords. They also deploy malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR and use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

Privilege Escalation: They use common techniques to gain higher privileges, such as dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ stealthy tactics, using passive backdoors, chaining web shells for complex movements, and using legitimate utilities like certutil to avoid detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with reconnaissance functionalities.

Credential Access: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. The trojanized KeePass is a clever way to log newly entered passwords.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to map the network and gather information about the environment, which helps them achieve their objectives.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally within the network. They employ tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. Also, they use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Command and Control: They use various methods for C2, including proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After leveraging WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally within victim networks, is FIN13 likely to collect data from network shared drives and then stage the data either locally or remotely for eventual fraudulent transactions?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, FIN13 is known for stealing various sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. So, their end goal is to get data that they can use for financial fraud.

They use WMI for lateral movement, which means they can access different parts of the network once they're inside. Network shared drives are likely places where sensitive documents are stored, so it makes sense that they would target those.

In the Discovery phase, they gather information about network and host configurations, user accounts, and services. This helps them understand where valuable data might be stored, including shared drives.

Also, in the Exfiltration phase, they use web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data. So, they have a way to get the data out once they've collected it.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they map victim networks and capture credentials, which would help them gain access to shared drives that might require specific permissions.

Given all this, it seems plausible that after moving laterally using WMI, they would collect data from network shared drives and stage it for exfiltration.

But let's consider if there's any information that might suggest otherwise.

The outline doesn't explicitly mention accessing shared drives, but given their objectives and the methods they use, it's a logical step.

They have a median dwell time of over two years, which means they have plenty of time to explore the network and access different resources.

They also use privilege escalation techniques to gain higher-level access, which would likely include access to shared drives.

Additionally, they use tools for internal reconnaissance, which would help them identify where sensitive data is stored.

So, based on their objectives and the tactics they employ, it's reasonable to conclude that they would collect data from network shared drives and stage it for exfiltration.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But to be thorough, let's consider why someone might choose B: No.

Maybe they only target specific systems or databases and don't bother with shared drives. However, shared drives often contain a wealth of sensitive information, so it's unlikely they would ignore them.

Alternatively, perhaps they have a different method for data collection that doesn't involve shared drives. But again, shared drives are a central repository for many organizations, especially in industries like finance, retail, and hospitality.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they steal various sensitive documents, which are likely to be stored on shared drives.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
