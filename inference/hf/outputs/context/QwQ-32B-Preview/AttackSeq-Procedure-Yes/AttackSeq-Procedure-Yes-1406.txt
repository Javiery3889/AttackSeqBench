Alright, I have this CTI outline here about a cyber attack targeting Instagram users, mainly influencers. It's reported by Jindrich Karasek from Trend Micro on July 12, 2021. So, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and then answer a question about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access**: The attackers targeted Instagram users, especially influencers, by impersonating technical support or friends of the victims. They used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram itself to deliver their messages. These messages had generic greetings and either claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges to trick victims into visiting phishing sites that looked like Instagram's interface.

2. **Impact**: After compromising the accounts, the attackers demanded ransom payments in bitcoin, prepaid credit cards, or vouchers for the return of the compromised accounts. Even after some victims paid, the attackers didn't restore access but kept asking for more payment. They also used the stolen accounts with large followings to perpetuate their scams and sold their hacking expertise in the cybercriminal underground.

Now, the question is: "After impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges, is it likely that the attackers will use phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials before locking out the original owners by changing account passwords?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

Okay, so I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let me think step by step.

First, the attack starts with initial access where attackers impersonate technical support or friends and contact victims via phishing emails or messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. The messages contain claims of copyright violations or offers of verified badges to lure victims to phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface.

So, the sequence here is:

- Impersonation (pretending to be technical support or friends)

- Delivery of phishing messages (via email, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram)

- Phishing messages contain links to fake Instagram login pages

- Victims, thinking it's legitimate, enter their credentials on these phishing sites

Then, according to the question, after these steps, is it likely that attackers will use these phishing sites to collect usernames, passwords, and email credentials, and then lock out the original owners by changing the account passwords?

Well, from the CTI outline, it's clear that the phishing sites are designed to collect login credentials. The fact that they mimic Instagram's interface suggests that they are set up to harvest usernames and passwords from victims who believe they are logging into their legitimate Instagram accounts.

Once the attackers have the credentials, it's plausible that they would log into the accounts themselves to take control. To prevent the original owners from logging back in, changing the account passwords is a likely step. This aligns with the impact described, where attackers lock out the original owners and demand ransom for the return of the accounts.

Moreover, the impact section mentions that even after paying the ransom, some victims didn't get their accounts back, and attackers continued to demand more payment. This suggests that once the attackers have control over the accounts, they maintain that control by keeping the passwords changed and not giving back access unless paid further.

Also, the attackers used the stolen accounts to perpetuate their scams and sold their hacking expertise in the underground. To do this, they need持续 access to the accounts, which again points to them changing passwords to prevent the original owners from interfering.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's highly likely that after collecting the credentials via phishing sites, the attackers would change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Wait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps the attackers don't necessarily change the passwords immediately after phishing the credentials. Maybe they use other methods to lock out the owners.

Let me check the CTI outline again. It says that they "lock out the original owners by changing account passwords." This directly supports the sequence described in the question.

Additionally, in the impact section, it mentions that attackers demanded ransom for the return of the compromised accounts, implying that they have control over the accounts, likely by changing the passwords.

Moreover, the fact that some victims paid the ransom but still didn't get their accounts back suggests that the attackers maintained control by keeping the passwords changed.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that after collecting the credentials via phishing sites, the attackers change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.

Hence, the correct answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
