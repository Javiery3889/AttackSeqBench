Alright, I have this CTI outline about a threat actor called Yellow Garuda, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about Yellow Garuda, which is also known by other names like Charming Kitten, PHOSPHORUS, and UNC788. They've been active since 2012 and are based in Iran. Their main activity is hacking into webmail services by spoofing login pages to steal credentials. Recently, they've started using Android malware called 1PINEFLOWER to exfiltrate data from mobile devices.

So, their main game is stealing credentials and expanding their capabilities to mobile devices.

Now, the outline mentions a new tactic they used in March 2022: using macro-enabled template files for initial access. These templates are hosted on services like Dropbox or AWS, and they likely phish victims into downloading and opening these documents.

Once the victim opens the document, the malicious macro runs, which apparently replaces the default Microsoft Word template, ensuring persistence. So, every time the victim opens Word, the malicious template loads.

There's also mention of defense evasion. The template files have RC4-encrypted strings, and the decryption key is fetched via an HTTP GET request to an Amazon S3 bucket. This suggests that if someone tries to analyze the document without the decryption key, they might not be able to see what's going on.

Next, credential access: Yellow Garuda has a history of phishing for credentials and recently started using a Telegram 'grabber' tool to exfiltrate data from victims' Telegram accounts. This tool can get messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. It requires access to the victim's active Telegram session or SMS messages for authentication.

Then, collection: The Telegram 'grabber' tool collects all that data and stores it in a SQLite database and JSON format. Also, the tool can delete messages from the victim's account.

Lastly, there's some information about their operational security (OPSEC) mistakes, where an open directory exposed some of their tools and procedures.

Now, the question is: After Yellow Garuda collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts using the Telegram 'grabber' tool, is it likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's look back at the relevant part of the outline:

"Collection: Yellow Garuda's Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts. The exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format. The tool also allows the threat actor to delete messages from the victim's account."

This directly states that the exfiltrated data is stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

So, based on this, it seems like the answer should be Yes.

But wait, let's think carefully. The question is asking if it's likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

The outline says that the data is stored within a SQLite database and in JSON format, but it doesn't explicitly say that it's exfiltrated over the web.

However, earlier in the outline, it mentions that the decryption key for the macro-enabled template is obtained via an HTTP GET request to an Amazon S3 bucket. This suggests that there is web communication involved in their attack chain.

Additionally, the Telegram 'grabber' tool likely needs to send the collected data back to the threat actor's servers, which would probably happen over the web.

So, while the outline doesn't explicitly state that the data is exfiltrated over the web, it's a reasonable inference based on the overall behavior of the threat actor.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

But to be thorough, let's consider why someone might choose No.

One reason could be that the outline doesn't explicitly state that the data is exfiltrated over the web. It only says that the data is stored in SQLite and JSON format, but it doesn't specify how it's transmitted.

However, given that Yellow Garuda is a remote threat actor based in Iran, it's highly likely that they would need to exfiltrate the data over the web to access it from their location.

Moreover, the use of macro-enabled templates that communicate with Amazon S3 suggests that they have web capabilities in their tools.

Therefore, it's plausible to conclude that the data is exfiltrated over the web.

Hence, the answer should be A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
