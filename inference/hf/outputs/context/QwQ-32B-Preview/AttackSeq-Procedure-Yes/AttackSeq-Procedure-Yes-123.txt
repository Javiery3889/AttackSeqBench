To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Agrius. The question is asking whether, after the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files, Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and the 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access**: Agrius gained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications, using exploits like CVE-2018-13379 and other vulnerabilities including SQL injection. Successful exploitation allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution**: They deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', which was used for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware. This backdoor was registered as a service for persistence and could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 server commands.

3. **Persistence**: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

4. **Defense Evasion**: Webshells were varied and some were obfuscated with custom base64 encoding. 'IPsec Helper' had capabilities to update its engine and delete traces to evade detection.

5. **Lateral Movement**: They used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leveraged compromised accounts for moving laterally within the network. They also used publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

6. **Command and Control**: 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, using a configuration file with encrypted server addresses. It awaited commands such as updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, looking at the question: "After the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files, is Agrius likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper that initially failed execution and the 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files as part of its data destruction activities?"

The question mentions 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware in the context of data destruction activities. However, in the CTI outline, there is no direct mention of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware being used by Agrius. The outline describes the use of 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and webshells for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and lateral movement, but does not specify any data destruction activities.

Given that, the answer should be that there is no indication in the provided CTI outline that Agrius deploys 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction activities. Therefore, it is unlikely based on the information provided.

So, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
