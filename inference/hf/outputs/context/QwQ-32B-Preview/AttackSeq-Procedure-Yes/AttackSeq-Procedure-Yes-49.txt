To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline provided and understand the sequence of events that occur after the initial access through phishing emails. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the CTI outline mentions that the initial access is achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros. The document is named 'Richard_Johnson.doc', and there are approximately 180 variants identified, with differences mainly in metadata and junk data within the macros. This suggests that the attackers are using a variety of document names and slight modifications to evade detection.

Upon opening the Word document, the embedded VBS macro is executed. According to the outline, this macro likely retrieves and executes an encoded PowerShell script. This is a common technique used by malware authors because PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that is natively available on Windows systems, making it an attractive choice for attackers.

The PowerShell script, as described in the outline, operates in memory to avoid detection. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk. This further enhances the script's ability to evade traditional antivirus detection mechanisms that rely on scanning files on disk.

The script communicates with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download payloads. It first attempts to use the DownloadString method to contact the C2 server and then the DownloadData method to download a resource from a second C2 server. This dual approach likely ensures redundancy and increases the chances of successfully retrieving the payloads.

The payloads downloaded by the PowerShell script are identified as GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. GandCrab is a well-known ransomware variant that encrypts files on the compromised system, demanding a ransom for their decryption. Ursnif, on the other hand, is a banking Trojan that can harvest credentials, gather system and process information, and potentially deploy additional malware.

Given this sequence of events, it is reasonable to conclude that after the initial access through the phishing email and the execution of the VBS macro, the encoded PowerShell script is indeed designed to execute and download the payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
