Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the BRONZE PRESIDENT group and a question related to their tactics. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's describing a cyberespionage group believed to be from the PRC that's been active since mid-2018, targeting NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia. Their phishing lures are related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics.

In terms of their operations:

- **Reconnaissance**: They do their homework, targeting specific organizations and tailoring their phishing emails to look relevant to the victims.

- **Resource Development**: They've developed their own remote access tools and also use publicly available ones like PlugX, which is known to be used by PRC-based groups.

- **Initial Access**: They use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files to get into the networks.

- **Execution**: They use a variety of tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is installed on most accessible hosts, and RCSession is installed via DLL side-loading.

- **Persistence**: They use WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain access.

- **Privilege Escalation**: After getting in, they escalate privileges and install malware on many systems, even domain controllers.

- **Defense Evasion**: They try to hide their activities, delete volume shadow copies, and kill processes after execution to avoid detection.

- **Credential Access**: They collect credentials from high-privilege accounts and extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files.

- **Discovery**: They use tools like Nmap and Nbtscan to map the network and find targets for lateral movement.

- **Lateral Movement**: They use Wmiexec and net commands to move laterally across the network.

- **Collection**: They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to collect files from specific locations.

- **Exfiltration**: They use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate the collected data.

The "Others" section mentions that the group has been active since 2014, and their long-term objective seems to be monitoring target networks. The suggestion is that they might have government sponsorship or tolerance due to their systematic and long-term approach.

Now, the question is: After using scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations during the Collection phase, is it likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will have ORat use a raw socket protocol for Command and Control communication?

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's recall what ORat is. From the outline, ORat is one of the tools used by BRONZE PRESIDENT, along with Cobalt Strike, PlugX, and RCSession. ORat is likely a remote access tool, probably a RAT (Remote Access Trojan), given the context.

The question is about whether ORat uses a raw socket protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication, especially after the collection phase.

To answer this, I need to think about a few things:

1. **Tool Capabilities**: What are the capabilities of ORat? Does it support raw socket communication?

2. **Group TTPs**: What are the typical Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of BRONZE PRESIDENT? Do they prefer using raw sockets for C2?

3. **Context in the Attack Lifecycle**: During the collection phase, they're gathering specific files using scripts. How does this relate to C2 communication?

4. **Other Tools and Their Communication Methods**: How do other tools used by the group handle C2 communication? Might ORat be similar or different?

Let's tackle these one by one.

1. **Tool Capabilities**:

   - The CTI outline mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses ORat, but it doesn't specify the capabilities of ORat in terms of C2 communication.

   - ORat could be a custom tool developed by the group, or it might be a publicly available tool that they've modified.

   - Generally, RATs can use various protocols for C2, including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or even raw sockets.

   - Raw sockets allow for lower-level communication and can be used to create custom protocols, which might help in evading network detection.

2. **Group TTPs**:

   - From the outline, BRONZE PRESIDENT is careful about evasion and tries to minimize detection.

   - They use tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession, which are known to use various communication methods, including HTTPS for Cobalt Strike.

   - They also use PlugX, which is known to use HTTP, HTTPS, and even DNS for C2 communication.

   - Given that they use a mix of tools with different communication methods, it's possible that ORat could use raw sockets if it helps in evading detection.

3. **Context in the Attack Lifecycle**:

   - During the collection phase, they're using scripts to gather specific files.

   - After collection, they need to exfiltrate this data.

   - For exfiltration, they use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike.

   - So, the C2 communication related to exfiltration might be handled by these tools.

   - If ORat is used for other purposes, like maintaining persistence or for lateral movement, it might have its own C2 communication method.

4. **Other Tools and Their Communication Methods**:

   - Cobalt Strike uses HTTPS by default but can be configured to use other protocols.

   - RCSession is likely a custom tool, and its communication method isn't specified in the outline.

   - PlugX can use HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.

   - Given this variety, it's possible that ORat uses raw sockets if it suits their needs.

Now, considering all this, I need to decide whether it's likely that ORat uses raw socket protocol for C2 communication after the collection phase.

Let's think about why they might choose raw sockets:

- **Evasion**: Raw sockets can help in evading network detection by using less common protocols or by mimicking legitimate traffic.

- **Customization**: They can customize the communication protocol to suit their needs and avoid signatures.

- **Reliability**: In some network environments, raw sockets might be more reliable for C2 communication.

However, there are also drawbacks:

- **Complexity**: Implementing raw socket communication can be more complex than using higher-level protocols.

- **Detection Risk**: If not implemented carefully, raw socket communication can stand out and attract attention.

Given that BRONZE PRESIDENT is a sophisticated group with resources to develop their own tools, they might have the capability to implement raw socket communication effectively.

Moreover, since they're careful about evasion and try to minimize their footprint, using raw sockets could be a part of their strategy to avoid detection.

On the other hand, tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession might already provide sufficient evasion techniques using higher-level protocols like HTTPS.

So, it's possible that ORat uses raw sockets, but it's not necessarily more likely than it using HTTPS or another protocol.

Looking back at the question: "After using scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations during the Collection phase, is it likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will have ORat use a raw socket protocol for Command and Control communication?"

The collection phase involves using scripts to gather files, and then these files are likely to be exfiltrated using tools like RCSession or Cobalt Strike.

ORat might be used for other purposes, such as maintaining persistence or for lateral movement, but there's no direct link in the outline connecting ORat to the collection phase or to the exfiltration process.

Therefore, it's not necessarily likely that ORat would use raw sockets for C2 communication in this specific context.

Additionally, the question seems to suggest a sequence: after collection, will ORat use raw sockets for C2?

Given that exfiltration is handled by other tools, and ORat's role isn't clearly defined in the collection/exfiltration phase, it's perhaps less likely that ORat would be used for raw socket communication in this scenario.

Hence, I would lean towards answer choice B: No.

But let's consider if there's any other information that might suggest otherwise.

The "Others" section mentions that the group's long-term objective is monitoring target networks, which suggests that they need reliable and stealthy C2 channels.

Raw sockets could be part of their toolkit to maintain such channels, but again, it's not specified in the outline.

Given the information provided, it's more about what they do during each phase, and there's no direct indication that ORat uses raw sockets for C2, especially after the collection phase.

Therefore, in the context of the question, it's not likely, and the answer should be B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
