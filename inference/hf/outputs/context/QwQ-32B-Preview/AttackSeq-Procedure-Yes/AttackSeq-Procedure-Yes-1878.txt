Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on Mexico and specific industries. This suggests they do thorough research on their targets before striking.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

3. **Execution**: Once inside, they use tools like JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and proxying network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server to listen for commands.

4. **Persistence**: To maintain access, they replace legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords and use malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. Custom droppers and malware with recon functionality are also used.

7. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

8. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement, employing tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using various utilities and libraries, focusing on data that helps in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: "Is it likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations?" with answer choices A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if the sequence of actions—first gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, and then dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials—aligns with FIN13's modus operandi as described in the CTI outline.

Let's look at the relevant parts of the outline:

- **Discovery**: FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

- **Privilege Escalation**: They utilize common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks. They have used utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials.

So, in the Discovery phase, they gather information about the network and host configurations using native OS binaries and other tools. Then, in the Privilege Escalation phase, they dump LSASS memory to obtain credentials.

This suggests that yes, it is likely that FIN13 would gather information on network and host configurations before attempting to dump LSASS process memory for credentials. The sequence makes sense because understanding the network and host configurations helps them identify targets and plan their movements within the network more effectively. Gathering this information first aids in identifying which systems to target for credential dumping and other activities.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they adapt to diverse victim networks, which implies that they need to understand the environment before proceeding with more aggressive actions like credential dumping.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
