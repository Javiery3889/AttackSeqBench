Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant called Hodur. The outline provides a lot of details about the attack, from the initial access to the exfiltration of data. My task is to answer a question about whether Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol after collecting data from various sources.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. Let's list them out:

1. **Resource Development**: The campaign uses a new Korplug variant named Hodur, active since August 2021, targeting research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions. They use phishing documents related to current events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

2. **Initial Access**: The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.

3. **Execution**: A custom loader is used to execute the new Korplug variant. This loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.

4. **Persistence**: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system directory under %allusersprofile%, copying necessary files there, and setting up persistence via a scheduled task or registry entry.

5. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign uses heavy control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. The Korplug file is encrypted and decrypted at runtime, and its configuration data is encrypted with XOR.

6. **Discovery**: Korplug collects information about the system, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, RAM amount, display resolution, system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time.

7. **Collection**: It collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including listing files and directories with their attributes and content, and collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

8. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.

Additionally, the "Others" section mentions that the campaign uses filenames reflecting current events and that the group iteratively improves its tools.

Now, the question is: After Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, is it likely for Korplug to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP?

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

To answer this, I need to look at the exfiltration part of the attack sequence. According to the outline, "Exfiltration: Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands, involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body."

This suggests that Korplug uses a custom protocol over TCP for both command and control (C&C) communications and data exfiltration. The protocol involves TCP messages with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.

The question asks if it's likely for Korplug to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

Given that the exfiltration is done via a custom protocol over TCP with encrypted messages, it's reasonable to infer that the C&C communications also use a similar custom protocol over TCP with encrypted communication.

However, the question mentions "initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP." This is a bit ambiguous. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, which typically uses TCP port 443, and involves SSL/TLS handshakes for encryption.

If the initial handshake is over HTTPS, it might suggest that the C&C communication starts with an HTTPS connection to establish the session, and then switches to a custom TCP protocol for subsequent communications.

Alternatively, if the initial handshake is over plain TCP, it likely means that the custom protocol uses TCP from the beginning without any HTTP involvement.

Given that the exfiltration uses a custom protocol over TCP with encrypted messages, it's possible that the C&C communications also use the same custom protocol, potentially starting with a TCP handshake and then proceeding with encrypted communication.

But the outline doesn't explicitly state whether the initial handshake uses HTTPS or plain TCP. It only mentions that exfiltration uses a custom protocol over TCP with encrypted messages.

However, considering that the group uses anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation, it's plausible that they might use HTTPS for the initial handshake to blend in with normal web traffic, making detection harder.

On the other hand, using plain TCP might be sufficient for their needs, especially if they're operating in an environment where TCP traffic is not closely monitored.

Given the information provided, the most likely scenario is that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for C&C communications, possibly with an initial handshake over TCP, followed by encrypted communication over TCP.

The mention of HTTPS in the question adds some uncertainty, but since the exfiltration uses a custom protocol over TCP, it's less likely that HTTPS is used for the initial handshake, unless the group is specifically trying to mimic legitimate HTTPS traffic.

Therefore, considering the details provided in the CTI outline, the answer is likely "Yes," Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

But to be more precise, it's probably more accurate to say that the initial handshake is over TCP, and then the communication is encrypted over TCP using their custom protocol.

However, since the question allows only "Yes" or "No," and the outline indicates that exfiltration uses a custom protocol over TCP with encrypted communication, it's reasonable to infer that C&C communications also use a similar protocol.

Hence, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
