I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack attributed to the threat group FIN13. The outline is structured around MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which helps in understanding the different stages of the attack. My task is to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about whether Mandiant is likely to track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in the Reconnaissance phase before using JSPRAT for Execution.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

**Initial Access:**
- FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK).
- They use these to establish a foothold in the victim's network.
- The specific vulnerabilities targeted are unclear due to long dwell times and insufficient evidence.
- Web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

**Execution:**
- FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
- They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server to listen for commands.

**Persistence:**
- Various methods are used, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords.
- Malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR are deployed.
- Email communications are used for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Common techniques are used, adapted to different victim networks.
- Utilities like ProcDump are used to dump LSASS process memory.
- Mimikatz is used to extract credentials.
- Certutil is used to launch obfuscated utilities.
- Trojanized KeePass binaries are used for credential harvesting.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Passive backdoors for stealth.
- Chaining web shells for complex pivots.
- Using legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection.
- Custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with recon functionality.

**Credential Access:**
- Techniques include process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing.
- Targeting unsecured credentials.
- Using trojanized KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

**Discovery:**
- Leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
- Gathers information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally.
- Employs utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.
- Uses Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

**Collection:**
- Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- Archives collected data using utilities and libraries.
- Targets specific data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

**Command and Control:**
- Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
- Transfers tools into the environment and encodes data for communication.

**Exfiltration:**
- Exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.
- Steals targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

**Others:**
- Median dwell time is 913 days, much longer than typical financially motivated actors.
- Operational lifespan is over five years.
- Targets only organizations in Mexico.
- Endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions.
- Despite the rise of ransomware, FIN13 remains focused on traditional cybercrime.

Now, the question is: "After FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK for Initial Access, is it likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution?"

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if FIN13 engages in reconnaissance activities before using JSPRAT for execution.

Looking back at the outline:

- **Initial Access:** They deploy web shells and malware to get into the network.

- **Execution:** They use JSPRAT for command execution and network traffic proxying.

- **Discovery:** They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

The Discovery phase seems to align with reconnaissance activities. According to the outline, FIN13 uses various methods for discovery, including native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware.

The question is whether Mandiant would track FIN13 as involving reconnaissance before using JSPRAT for execution.

Given that discovery (reconnaissance) is listed after initial access and execution in the outline, it might suggest that execution happens before discovery. However, in real-world scenarios, these phases can overlap or occur in different orders.

I need to consider the sequence of events:

1. Initial Access: Deploy web shells and malware.

2. Execution: Use JSPRAT for command execution and proxying.

3. Discovery: Gather information about the network.

It's possible that after gaining initial access and setting up execution capabilities, the threat actors would then perform reconnaissance to understand the network better.

But according to the outline, discovery is listed after execution, which might imply that execution happens first, followed by discovery.

However, in practice, reconnaissance could happen at multiple stages. They might do some initial reconnaissance to choose their initial access point, then more in-depth reconnaissance after gaining access.

But the question is specifically about whether Mandiant would track FIN13 as involved in gathering victim network information during the reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for execution.

Given that the outline shows discovery (reconnaissance) after execution, it suggests that execution occurs before reconnaissance. Therefore, it's less likely that Mandiant would track FIN13 as performing reconnaissance before using JSPRAT for execution.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

But I need to think carefully. Maybe there is some overlap or parallel activities.

Alternatively, perhaps reconnaissance happens concurrently with execution, but not before.

Looking back at the outline, there's no explicit statement about the timing of discovery relative to execution.

However, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the phases are:

1. Reconnaissance

2. Initial Access

3. Execution

4. Persistence

5. Privilege Escalation

6. Defense Evasion

7. Credential Access

8. Discovery

9. Lateral Movement

10. Collection

11. Command and Control

12. Exfiltration

13. Impact

According to this sequence, discovery typically comes after execution.

But in practice, threat actors might perform reconnaissance at multiple stages.

Given that the CTI outline shows discovery after execution, it's likely that Mandiant observes FIN13 performing reconnaissance after gaining execution capabilities, not before.

Therefore, it's not likely that Mandiant would track FIN13 as performing reconnaissance before employing JSPRAT for execution.

So, the answer should be B: No.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there's any indication that reconnaissance happens before initial access.

The outline mentions that FIN13 targets only organizations in Mexico, which suggests some level of initial reconnaissance to select targets.

However, the question is about tracking FIN13's activities within a victim's network after initial access, not before.

Therefore, the focus should be on the activities post-initial access.

Given that, and the sequence in the outline, it's unlikely that Mandiant would track FIN13 as performing reconnaissance before using JSPRAT for execution.

Hence, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
