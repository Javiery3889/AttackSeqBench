I've got this CTI outline about a rootkit called CEIDPageLock, which is being spread by something called the RIG Exploit kit. So, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here.

Starting with the Initial Access phase, it says that this rootkit is being distributed by the RIG Exploit kit, and it was first found by 360 Security Center. The rootkit is messing with the homepage of the victim's browser, changing it to a site that looks like 2345.com, which is a Chinese web directory. So, it seems like the attack starts with getting the malware onto the victim's computer through this exploit kit.

Next, the Persistence part: the dropper— that's the piece of malware that delivers the main payload—its main job is to take the driver from the file and save it in the Windows Temp directory as houzi.sys. This driver was previously named CEID.sys and has a certificate that was signed by Thawte, but it's been revoked. After putting the driver in place and starting it, the dropper sends the MAC address and user ID of the infected computer to a domain called www.tj999.top. So, they're establishing a way to identify and communicate with the infected machine.

Then, Defense Evasion: The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver that gets loaded along with the standard system drivers when the system starts up. It uses some tricks to hide from endpoint security products. It connects to one of two hard-coded command and control (C&C) domains to download a configuration that tells it which homepage to change the browser to. The homepage configuration is downloaded encrypted from the C&C server.

Command and Control: The driver connects to those hard-coded C&C domains to get the homepage configuration.

In the Others section, it mentions that CEIDPageLock targets Chinese victims mainly, with very few infections outside of China. It also adds that the malware tries to create a registry key in a specific security product, 360Safe's safemon, as part of the rootkit installation routine. The rootkit sets a value under a particular registry key related to 360Safe.

Now, the question is: After the operators use tricks to hide the driver from endpoint security products and evade defenses during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that they will gather browsing data on victims and use this information for targeted ad campaigns or selling to marketing companies as part of the Collection phase?

The answer choices are Yes or No.

Okay, so I need to think about what the malware is doing and whether it's likely involved in collecting browsing data for ads or selling to marketers.

From the outline, the main activity described is changing the browser homepage to a fake 2345.com site. It also mentions that the driver connects to C&C servers to download configurations for which homepage to change to, and this configuration is encrypted.

But there's no explicit mention of the malware collecting browsing data or engaging in activities related to advertising or marketing.

However, changing the homepage could be a way to redirect users to a specific site, which might be used for serving ads or other purposes. But that's speculative.

Moreover, the fact that it's targeting Chinese victims specifically might indicate that the operators have some interest in that region, but again, without more information, it's hard to say exactly what their motives are.

The question is about whether, after evading defenses, they are likely to collect browsing data for targeted ad campaigns or selling to marketing companies.

Given the information provided, it seems that the main function is to change the homepage and possibly redirect users to a specific site. While this could be related to serving ads, there's no direct evidence in the outline that the malware is collecting browsing data beyond what's necessary for this redirection.

Therefore, I would lean towards answering No, it is not likely that they will gather browsing data for targeted ad campaigns or selling to marketing companies based on the information provided.

But let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.

The driver connects to C&C servers to get configurations, and it's encrypting the homepage configuration. Maybe they are collecting more data than just the homepage settings.

However, the outline doesn't specify what other data is being collected or transmitted. It's possible that they are collecting more data, but without evidence, it's speculative.

Moreover, the main observed behavior is changing the homepage, which could be part of a broader scheme to redirect traffic for ad purposes, but again, that's not directly stated.

Given that, I think the safest answer is No, based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B**
