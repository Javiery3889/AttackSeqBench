Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the BRONZE PRESIDENT group and a question about their tactics. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. So, starting with Reconnaissance, it says that this group targets NGOs, political and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia since mid-2018. They use phishing emails related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics.

Next is Resource Development. They have their own remote access tools and also use publicly available ones. Their infrastructure is linked to entities within the PRC and uses PRC-based ISPs. They've been using tools like PlugX, which is historically associated with PRC-based groups.

Then, Initial Access: They likely use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files as the initial access vector. They gain admin access to all systems within a targeted business unit and install remote access tools on a significant number of hosts.

Execution: They use various tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is installed on over 70% of accessible hosts in some intrusions, and RCSession is installed via DLL side-loading.

Persistence: They use WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. They create tasks like the Sysdriver scheduled task to periodically execute payloads.

Privilege Escalation: After compromising the network, they elevate privileges and install malware on a large proportion of systems. They use native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files containing password hashes.

Defense Evasion: They take steps to minimize detection, like deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution. They install malware on many hosts but exercise restraint to avoid detection.

Credential Access: They collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts. They also extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation.

Lateral Movement: They leverage Wmiexec extensively to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials.

Collection: They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to collate identified files into archives. They use scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations.

Command and Control: Their C2 techniques vary based on the remote access tools used. RCSession communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using a custom protocol, while ORat uses a raw socket protocol. Cobalt Strike uses malleable C2 profiles and connects to multiple C2 domains.

Exfiltration: They use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate archived data. They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to create lists of files with predefined criteria for exfiltration.

Others: Secureworks has been monitoring their activity since mid-2018, with artifacts suggesting network intrusions dating back to 2014. Their long-term objective appears to be monitoring target networks. The group's systemic long-term targeting suggests government sponsorship or tolerance.

Now, the question is: After compromising a network through phishing emails containing LNK files and achieving initial access, is BRONZE PRESIDENT likely to escalate privileges using native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies before employing tools such as Nmap and Nbtscan to perform network service discovery?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to evaluate whether, after initial access, they would first escalate privileges using vssadmin and then use tools like Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery.

First, let's look at the Privilege Escalation section. It mentions that they use native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files containing password hashes. So, yes, they do use vssadmin for privilege escalation.

Now, for network service discovery, the outline mentions that they use Wmiexec extensively for lateral movement and also use net commands. However, it doesn't specifically mention tools like Nmap or Nbtscan.

Nmap and Nbtscan are tools commonly used for network discovery and mapping, but according to the outline, BRONZE PRESIDENT primarily uses Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement.

So, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it seems that BRONZE PRESIDENT prefers using Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement rather than Nmap or Nbtscan.

Therefore, it's less likely that they would use Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery, given that the outline doesn't mention them using these tools.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

But let's double-check.

The question is about the sequence: after initial access, escalate privileges using vssadmin, and then use Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery.

From the outline, they do use vssadmin for privilege escalation, but for network service discovery, they use Wmiexec and net commands, not Nmap or Nbtscan.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question doesn't align with the tactics outlined in the CTI report.

So, the correct answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
