Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Turla group and their recent activities. I need to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about their tactics during the discovery phase and whether they're likely to use their backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline properly. It mentions that Turla is using PowerShell to run malware in memory, which helps them avoid detection since they're not dropping executables on the disk. This is under the Execution tactic, which makes sense because that's when they're actually running their malicious code.

Next, it talks about Persistence. They're using two methods to maintain access to the compromised system: WMI event subscriptions and modifying the PowerShell profile. The WMI method involves creating event filters and consumers that execute base64-encoded PowerShell commands, which load a large script from the registry. The PowerShell profile is altered to run a script every time PowerShell starts, which loads and executes the malware. This ensures that even if the system is restarted, the malware persists.

Then, there's Defense Evasion. Their PowerShell scripts are designed to evade detection by encrypting payloads and obfuscating scripts. They also use an AMSI bypass technique, which patches the AmsiScanBuffer function in memory to prevent antimalware products from scanning their buffers. This is a sophisticated way to avoid being detected by security software.

Moving on to Discovery, Turla uses two backdoors: RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor. These are used for lateral movement within a network and to control other machines. Both backdoors have basic features like file upload, download, and command execution. The RPC backdoor can also load plugins, which can gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives. PowerStallion monitors antimalware logs and the Windows process list.

Command and Control (C2) communication is handled differently by each backdoor. The RPC backdoor uses the RPC protocol, while PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive via SMB as its C2 server. This is interesting because using OneDrive for C2 can help them blend in with normal network traffic.

Lastly, Exfiltration is mentioned for PowerStallion, which exfiltrates information by writing command results to a OneDrive subfolder and encrypting them with XOR key 0xAA. This shows that they have a method for getting data out of the compromised network in a way that's hard to detect.

Now, the question is: After implementing file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase, is Turla likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase?

So, I need to think about the sequence of their actions. In the discovery phase, they're likely mapping the network, understanding the environment, and gaining access to more systems using lateral movement techniques. They've already implemented file upload and download capabilities with the RPC backdoor, which is part of this discovery process.

The question is asking about the collection phase, which I assume is when they start gathering sensitive information to exfiltrate. So, during this phase, would they use the backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives?

Looking back at the outline, it says that the RPC backdoor supports the addition of plugins, which can gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives. So, it seems that they have the capability to collect files from USB drives and possibly recent files.

But is it likely that they would use this capability during the collection phase?

Well, collecting recent files and files from USB drives sounds like it would be part of their information gathering process. Recent files could contain sensitive information, and USB drives are often used to transfer data in and out of networks, so monitoring them could be valuable for the attackers.

Given that they have the plugins available to gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives, it makes sense that they would use these plugins during the collection phase to gather the desired information.

So, considering this, the answer should be "Yes," they are likely to use their backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase.

But let's consider if there's any reason to think otherwise. Maybe they have other methods for collection, or perhaps using these plugins would raise alarms. However, the outline doesn't mention any such constraints. The plugins are designed for these purposes, and it's part of their toolkit, so it's reasonable to assume they would use them for collection.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
