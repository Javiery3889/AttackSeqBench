Alright, I have this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about a report from Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov from March 13, 2018, focusing on reconnaissance efforts by cybercriminals targeting medical networks. They used tools like masscan and search engines like Shodan and Censys to find potential entry points into these networks.

So, reconnaissance is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, where attackers gather information about their targets before launching an actual attack. In this case, the targets are medical networks, and the attackers are looking for vulnerabilities or entry points.

The report mentions that they extracted IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords and used Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations. They found non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication. These could be exploited for further reconnaissance.

Additionally, the "Others" section provides context about the threats affecting medical networks, including malware infections and targeted attacks by APT groups using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data. The report suggests that these attacks might be aimed at intellectual property or business plans.

Now, the question is: After using tools such as masscan and search engines like Shodan and Censys to identify potential entry points into medical networks during reconnaissance, is it likely that the cybercriminals discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter?

The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

To answer this, I need to see if the CTI outline provides any information that suggests the discovery of outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting MQTT protocol.

From the outline, I see that they did find Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication. So, they did discover certain types of systems and services during their reconnaissance.

Now, the question is whether it's likely that they also discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting MQTT.

First, Building Management systems: The outline mentions Building Management systems using Niagara Fox protocol. Niagara Fox is a protocol used in some Building Management systems, so it's possible that these systems are outdated, but the outline doesn't specifically state that they are outdated.

Second, medical devices supporting MQTT: The outline doesn't mention MQTT at all. MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT devices, including some medical devices. So, whether the attackers discovered medical devices using MQTT isn't directly stated in the outline.

Given that, I need to make an inference based on the information provided.

The report talks about discovering non-trivial ports and services, including Building Management systems and printers with vulnerabilities. It's plausible that in such an environment, there could be other internet-connected devices, including medical devices, that might be using protocols like MQTT.

However, since the outline doesn't specifically mention MQTT or outdated Building Management systems, I have to consider whether it's likely based on the context.

The report does emphasize that these medical networks have vulnerabilities, such as outdated protocols and lack of authentication. Therefore, it's possible that outdated systems and devices using protocols like MQTT could be present.

But, the key here is that the question asks if it's likely, based on the reconnaissance activities described, that they discovered these specific types of systems.

Given that they used tools like Shodan and Censys, which can reveal a lot about exposed services and protocols, it's possible that they could have discovered devices using MQTT if those devices were exposed on public-facing ports.

However, the outline doesn't provide specific information about MQTT or the age of the Building Management systems.

So, I need to consider the plausibility.

Building Management systems can be outdated, especially in older facilities, and medical devices can vary in their protocols. MQTT is increasingly being used in IoT devices, including some medical devices, so it's possible that some medical devices on the network perimeter could be using MQTT.

Given that the attackers were conducting thorough reconnaissance and identifying various services, it's plausible that they could have discovered such devices.

But, since the outline doesn't specifically mention MQTT or the age of the Building Management systems, I have to rely on general knowledge about medical networks and the protocols they might use.

Considering that, I think it's reasonable to infer that it's likely they discovered such systems and devices during their reconnaissance.

Therefore, I would choose answer "A: Yes."

But, to be thorough, let's consider why "No" might not be the correct answer.

If I choose "B: No," I would need a reason to believe that it's unlikely they discovered outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting MQTT.

However, based on the outline, we know that they did find vulnerable systems like Building Management systems and printers with weaknesses. It's possible that other vulnerable devices, including those using MQTT, could be present.

Moreover, the "Others" section mentions that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017, indicating a prevalent security issue in medical networks.

Therefore, choosing "No" would require assuming that, despite the presence of other vulnerabilities, there were no outdated Building Management systems or medical devices using MQTT, which seems less plausible.

Hence, "A: Yes" seems to be the more appropriate answer.

**Final Answer**

A: Yes
