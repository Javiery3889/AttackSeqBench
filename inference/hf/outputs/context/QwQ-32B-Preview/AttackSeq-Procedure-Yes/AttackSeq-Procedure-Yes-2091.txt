Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Carbanak group's attack, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It's ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which helps in tracking the stages of the attack.

Starting with Reconnaissance: The Carbanak group gathered data on banking applications and internal procedures outside of business hours to avoid detection. This information was prepared for exfiltration for use in the final stage of the attack.

Next, Initial Access: They used spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word to download a Cobalt Strike beacon. This is how they got into the system initially.

Then, Execution: Once inside, they could download and execute new payloads, run shell commands for lateral movement, and delete files to cover their tracks.

Persistence: They set up a backdoor through the Command and Control (C&C) server to maintain access.

Privilege Escalation: Their goal was to get admin-level credentials to move around the entire infrastructure. They managed to compromise a Domain Administrator account and used it throughout the attack.

Defense Evasion: They operated outside of business hours, interacted with only a few systems, and used single workstations as hubs for centralizing information and communicating with their C&C server.

Credential Access: They got hold of Domain Administrator credentials and used them to compromise more endpoints within the first day.

Discovery: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon, they mapped the internal network, collected admin credentials, and compromised additional endpoints.

Collection: They collected and prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

Command and Control: The Cobalt Strike beacon was their communication tool with the compromised systems.

Exfiltration: They prepared the collected documents for exfiltration.

Additionally, in the "Others" section, it mentions that they impersonated high-profile organizations in their phishing campaigns and that the group was active up until May 2018, despite some arrests.

Now, the question is: After discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials, is it likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to think about what typically happens in an attack sequence after discovery and credential access, especially with admin-level credentials.

From the outline, I see that after discovery and credential access, they aimed to find admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure. They did compromise a Domain Administrator account and used it throughout the attack. Also, they compromised at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day.

Given that they have admin-level credentials and their goal was to move across the entire infrastructure, it's logical to assume that they would use these credentials to move laterally, compromising more systems.

Moreover, in the Execution phase, it's mentioned that they could run shell commands to move laterally in the infrastructure. So, lateral movement was part of their capabilities and intentions.

Therefore, considering their goals and the capabilities they had, it's likely that they did move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

So, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let's double-check. Is there any information in the outline that suggests they didn't move laterally or that they limited their movement?

Looking back, in the Defense Evasion section, it says they minimized detection opportunities by operating outside of business hours, limiting interaction to a handful of systems, and using single workstations as hubs.

This seems a bit contradictory. On one hand, they aim to move across the entire infrastructure, and on the other, they limit interaction to a handful of systems.

However, limiting interaction to a handful of systems doesn't necessarily mean they didn't move laterally. They could have used those systems as pivots to access other parts of the network without directly interacting with many systems.

Also, the fact that they compromised at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day suggests that lateral movement did occur.

Furthermore, the goal of finding admin-level credentials and compromising a Domain Administrator account indicates that they wanted broad access to the network, which typically involves lateral movement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that they did move laterally across the infrastructure.

So, the final answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
