Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant called Hodur. The outline provides a lot of details about the attack sequence, and I need to answer a question based on this information. The question is about what happens after the malware performs data discovery on the systemâ€”specifically, whether it's likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

**CTI Outline Analysis:**

1. **Resource Development:** ESET researchers found an ongoing campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant named Hodur. The campaign targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using phishing documents related to current events in Europe.

2. **Initial Access:** The initial access vector is believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks. They use filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document to distract the victim.

3. **Execution:** The campaign uses a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable. It exports multiple functions, but only one is responsible for loading the final malware stage. This function decrypts the encrypted Korplug file in memory and makes the buffer executable before calling into it.

4. **Persistence:** The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a directory under %allusersprofile%, marking it as hidden and system, and copying necessary files there. It sets up persistence either by creating a scheduled task to run at boot or by adding a registry entry. Then, it launches the executable from its new location and exits.

5. **Defense Evasion:** The campaign uses heavy control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques at every stage. The downloader and loader use methods like junk code, opaque predicates, and encrypted stack strings. The Korplug file is encrypted and only decrypted at runtime, with its configuration data encrypted using XOR. Directories are set as hidden system directories, and the malware can run commands on a hidden desktop.

6. **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, RAM amount, display resolution, system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time.

7. **Collection:** It collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It can list files and directories with their attributes and content and collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.

8. **Command and Control (C2):** Korplug communicates with C2 servers using a custom TCP-based protocol. The initial handshake can be done over HTTPS or TCP, but subsequent communication is always over TCP. The communication is encrypted using RC4 and may use non-standard ports. The configuration contains fallback C2 servers, and Korplug can download additional files from the C2 server.

9. **Others:** The campaign uses filenames reflecting current events to lure victims, showing the group's ability to react quickly to world events. The group iteratively improves its tools, including using trident downloaders to deploy Korplug. ESET offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.

**Question Analysis:**

The question is: "After Mustang Panda's Korplug variant performs data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, is it likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages?"

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

So, I need to determine whether, after performing data discovery, Korplug is likely to use a custom protocol for exfiltrating data over TCP, with the data being compressed and encrypted.

**Approach:**

1. **Identify the relevant parts of the CTI outline:** Focus on the sections related to data collection and command and control communication.

2. **Analyze the data collection phase:** Understand what data is collected and how it might be exfiltrated.

3. **Examine the command and control communication:** Look for details on how the malware communicates with its C2 servers, especially regarding data transmission.

4. **Assess the likelihood of using a custom protocol with compression and encryption:** Based on the information provided, determine if such features are likely to be part of the exfiltration process.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Data Collection Phase:**

   - Korplug collects extensive system information, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.

   - This suggests that the malware gathers a significant amount of data, which may include sensitive files and information.

2. **Command and Control Communication:**

   - Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for communication with C2 servers.

   - The initial handshake can be over HTTPS or TCP, but subsequent communication is always over TCP.

   - Communication is encrypted using RC4.

   - May use non-standard ports.

   - Configuration contains fallback C2 servers.

   - Can download additional files from the C2 server.

3. **Exfiltration Method:**

   - The question specifically asks about exfiltration over TCP using a custom protocol with compressed and encrypted messages.

   - From the C2 communication details, we know that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol that encrypts communication using RC4.

   - However, the outline does not explicitly mention compression of data during exfiltration.

4. **Likelihood Assessment:**

   - Given that Korplug uses a custom protocol for C2 communication and encrypts data using RC4, it is plausible that the same protocol could be used for exfiltrating collected data.

   - The use of encryption in C2 communication suggests that the malware authors are concerned about data confidentiality, which aligns with the idea of encrypting exfiltrated data.

   - Compression could be used to reduce the size of the exfiltrated data, making it faster to transmit and less likely to arouse suspicion by generating less network traffic.

   - However, the CTI outline does not explicitly state that data is compressed before exfiltration.

5. **Contextual Clues:**

   - The malware uses anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation, indicating a level of sophistication.

   - The use of a custom protocol and encryption suggests that the malware is designed to evade detection and analysis.

   - Given this level of sophistication, it is reasonable to assume that the malware may employ compression to optimize data exfiltration.

6. **Conclusion:**

   - Based on the information provided, it is likely that Korplug uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, and given the encryption already in place, it is plausible that the data is also compressed to optimize transmission.

   - Therefore, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
