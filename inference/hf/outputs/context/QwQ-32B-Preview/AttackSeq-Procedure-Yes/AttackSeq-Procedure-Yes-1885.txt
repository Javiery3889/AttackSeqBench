Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials and sensitive documents to carry out fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they don't deploy ransomware; instead, they focus on traditional cybercrime activities.

So, the outline breaks down their tactics based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a matrix that categorizes different stages of a cyber attack. Let's go through the outline step by step to understand their attack sequence.

First, under Reconnaissance, it says that FIN13 has been tracked since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They target specific industries in Mexico and have a long dwell time, meaning they stay in the network for extended periods, averaging around 913 days. That's way longer than usual for financially motivated actors.

Moving on to Initial Access: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK to get into the network. The outline mentions that specific vulnerabilities aren't clear due to long dwell times and insufficient evidence, but web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

Next, Persistence: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions that log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. They also use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

Then, Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses common techniques to gain higher privileges, like dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ stealthy tactics, including using passive backdoors, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and using legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with reconnaissance functionality.

Credential Access: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. The trojanized KeePass is a key tool here for logging passwords.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to map the network and gather information about the environment, which helps them achieve their objectives.

Lateral Movement: FIN13 moves laterally across the network using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands remotely. They use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, as well as Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

Collection: They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely, archiving it using various utilities and libraries, focusing on data that can be used for fraudulent transactions.

Command and Control: They use proxies, different protocols, and encode data for communication. They also transfer tools into the environment as needed.

Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal the targeted data for their fraudulent activities.

Now, the question is: After FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, is it likely that they will employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution, before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to determine the sequence of their tactics based on the outline.

First, in Initial Access, they deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK on external servers. So, BLUEAGAVE is mentioned as one of the custom malware they use for initial access.

Then, in Persistence, they use tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries, among others.

The question is asking if, after initial access using web shells and custom malware, they are likely to employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other persistence methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

Hmm, BLUEAGAVE is already mentioned as part of the initial access, but it's also described as a passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server for command execution.

So, is BLUEAGAVE used both for initial access and for persistence?

Looking back at the outline, it says they deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK for initial access. Then, in persistence, they use SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

But BLUEAGAVE is also described as a passive backdoor that listens for incoming commands, which sounds like a persistence mechanism.

Maybe BLUEAGAVE serves dual purposes: initial access and persistence.

Given that, it's likely that after gaining initial access with BLUEAGAVE, they might maintain persistence with it and possibly deploy additional persistence mechanisms like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

But the question is specifically asking if, after initial access, they employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods for persistence.

Given that BLUEAGAVE is already deployed during initial access and it's a passive backdoor, perhaps they don't need to employ it again; it's already in place.

So, maybe the sequence is: initial access with BLUEAGAVE and web shells, then deploying additional persistence mechanisms like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

Therefore, it might not be accurate to say they employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after initial access, because it's already deployed during initial access.

Alternatively, perhaps they deploy BLUEAGAVE initially, and then reinforce persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

But the outline doesn't specify the exact sequence; it just lists the tools used for initial access and persistence.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to choose the most plausible sequence based on the outline.

Given that BLUEAGAVE is used for initial access and is a passive backdoor, it's likely that it's already in place for persistence after initial access.

Therefore, it may not be necessary for them to employ it again after initial access; it's already there.

So, employing other persistence mechanisms like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass would be the next step.

Hence, the answer might be B: No, because they don't need to employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after initial access; it's already part of the initial access toolkit.

But wait, the question says "employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution, before using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries."

So, it's asking if, after initial access, they use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other persistence methods.

But BLUEAGAVE is already used in initial access, so perhaps the sequence is: initial access with BLUEAGAVE, then additional persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

In that case, they don't employ BLUEAGAVE again after initial access; it's already there.

Therefore, the answer would be B: No, because they don't employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after initial access; it's already deployed during initial access.

Alternatively, if BLUEAGAVE is only used for initial access and they need to deploy separate persistence mechanisms, then again, the answer would be B: No.

But perhaps BLUEAGAVE serves both purposes, so they employ it for initial access and it remains for persistence.

In that case, they might not need to employ additional passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after initial access.

Hence, the answer remains B: No.

I think that's the most plausible sequence based on the information provided.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
