Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the StellarParticle campaign attributed to COZY BEAR, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's divided into different MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Collection. Each section describes specific techniques used by the threat actor.

Starting with Initial Access:

- They used SSH to log into a public-facing system with credentials obtained from previous theft.

- They used port forwarding to set up RDP sessions to internal servers using different domain accounts.

- They also used VPNs to gain access and persist in the network.

- Additionally, they exported saved passwords from Chrome browsers.

So, in the initial phase, they're getting a foothold into the network using multiple methods, including leveraging previously stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities in SSH and RDP.

Next, Persistence:

- They used credential hopping, moving laterally through the network using different credentials at each step.

- They used accounts with Delegated Administrator rights to access other O365 tenants and create persistence.

- They used malware like TrailBlazer and GoldMax for persistence via WMI and crontab entries.

- They added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new ones to maintain access.

This shows that they're not only getting in but also ensuring they can maintain access over time, using a variety of sophisticated methods, including malware and abusing cloud services.

Defense Evasion:

- They stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.

- They renamed utilities to look like legitimate system binaries.

- They also renamed systems to match the victim's naming convention before connecting to VPNs.

This indicates that they're trying to hide their activities and avoid detection by security systems.

Discovery:

- They used tools like AdFind and standard PowerShell cmdlets to gather information from Active Directory.

- They used tasklist.exe to interrogate other systems and probe external services to regain access.

So, they're actively mapping the network and looking for more ways to expand their access.

Lateral Movement:

- They used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move around the environment.

This suggests they're flexible in their approach, using whatever credentials are available to them.

Collection:

- They accessed data from Information Repositories.

Meaning, they're going after specific data stores to exfiltrate information.

Now, the question is: After utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence, is it likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations before using web session cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's think about this.

First, the outline mentions that they used credential hopping for persistence and lateral movement. Credential hopping is a technique where attackers move laterally through a network by collecting and reusing credentials found on each system they compromise.

They also configured malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence, which means they're setting up backdoors to maintain access to the systems they've compromised.

Now, the question is asking whether, after doing these things, it's likely that they would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations and use those cookies to access cloud resources.

Looking back at the outline, under Initial Access, it mentions that they exported saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations. This suggests that they are already interested in and capable of stealing browser-stored credentials, which could include session cookies.

Additionally, under Defense Evasion, it specifically states that they stole browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA). This directly indicates that they use browser cookies as a way to access cloud resources, likely to bypass MFA protections.

So, based on this information, it seems that stealing web session cookies is indeed part of their modus operandi. They have already demonstrated this behavior in the initial access phase and use it specifically to bypass MFA.

Therefore, it is likely that after establishing persistence and moving laterally using credential hopping and malware, they would continue to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations to access cloud resources.

Moreover, since they are already using O365 Service Principals for persistence, it makes sense that they would also use browser cookies to access cloud services, as these cookies often contain session tokens that can be used to authenticate to cloud applications without needing traditional username and password credentials.

Additionally, by stealing session cookies, they can maintain access even if the actual passwords change, as long as the sessions remain valid.

Given all this, the answer should be A: Yes, it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations before using those cookies in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.

This aligns with their observed behaviors and the techniques they have already employed in the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: A**
