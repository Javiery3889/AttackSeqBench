I have a CTI outline that describes a cyber attack campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, with similarities to an earlier campaign named MuddyWater. The campaign uses malicious documents containing text and file names in the Tajik language to target individuals working for government organizations and telecommunication companies in Tajikistan. The documents use social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros and activating the payload. Some payloads are embedded in the document, while others are downloaded from the internet after the lure is clicked. There's also a separate lure with a Java key generator bundled with a Java downloader, but the payload is the same in both cases.

After the payload is executed, two files are created in the ProgramData directory in randomly named directories. A VBS script is used to execute a PowerShell script, and the path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence. In other campaigns, two files are dropped: a VBS script and a base64 encoded text file, which decodes into a PowerShell file. The latest change drops three files: an .sct scriptlet file, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file. The scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

The PowerShell script has multiple layers of obfuscation and is divided into three parts: global variables like paths and encryption keys, functions related to encryption, and the backdoor function. The backdoor function collects machine information, takes screenshots, and sends this data to a C&C server while waiting for commands.

The persistence mechanism adds the VBS script path to the task scheduler. The backdoor collects machine information and takes screenshots, which are sent to the C&C server. Communication with the C&C server is via XML messages with specific ACTION commands like REGISTER, IMAGE, COMMAND, RESULT, and UPLOAD. The backdoor determines the machine's IP address and location and sends system information as part of the REGISTER message. Communication is encrypted using a simple RSA algorithm with small keys.

Additionally, the attackers are actively monitoring the C&C server, as indicated by a personalized message to a researcher who made an improper request. There's also a hidden message in the PowerShell script written in simplified Mandarin Chinese, which appears if communication with the C&C fails and the script is run from a command line. This might be a false flag to mislead researchers.

Now, the question is: After payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access and macros are enabled leading to file execution in randomly named directories during Execution, is it likely that campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics?

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to look at the CTI outline and see if there's evidence of obfuscation and the use of publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

First, in the Execution phase, it's mentioned that the PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation. This directly points to the use of obfuscation techniques as part of their tactics.

Second, regarding the use of publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker, the outline states that in the latest change, three files are dropped: an .sct scriptlet file, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file. It specifically mentions that the scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

So, based on this information, it's clear that the campaign uses both obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

Therefore, the answer should be:

A: Yes

But to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's look at the question again. It asks if it's likely that campaigns use these methods as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

Defense Evasion is a MITRE ATT&CK tactic that involves techniques used by attackers to prevent detection and analysis of their activities. Obfuscation and using tools to bypass security measures like AppLocker are indeed part of Defense Evasion.

Given that the CTI outline explicitly mentions these activities, it's reasonable to conclude that yes, the campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

So, the final answer is:

A: Yes
