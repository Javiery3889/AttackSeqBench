Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Longhorn group and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about the Longhorn group, which has been active since 2011, using back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to attack targets. There's a specific instance where a computer in the U.S. was compromised, but an uninstaller was launched within hours, suggesting it was an unintentional infection. Symantec first noticed their operations in 2014, when a zero-day exploit was used in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

So, the attack sequence starts with initial access through a zero-day exploit in a Word document, leading to the installation of Plexor malware.

Next, the outline mentions that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. It also uses operational security measures to remain undetected. This suggests that once the malware is installed, it performs various actions to gather information and stay hidden.

Under the "Collection" section, it says the malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules. It's designed for espionage operations with capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

In the "Command and Control" part, it explains that Longhorn configures specific domain and IP address combinations for each target's C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically from legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting services. The malware communicates over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.

The "Exfiltration" section mentions that the malware communicates externally at select times, with limits on the amount of data exfiltrated and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

Lastly, under "Others," Symantec has been protecting against Longhorn's tools for three years and has tracked the group's activities against 40 targets in 16 countries. Longhorn uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses. They operate with high operational security and seem to follow a standard Monday to Friday workweek, possibly from an English-speaking, North American country.

Now, the question is: "After using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware, is it likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware?"

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to determine whether, after infecting a target with Plexor malware using a zero-day exploit in a Word document, Longhorn's tools would follow tactics to avoid detection before conducting system fingerprinting and discovery.

Looking back at the CTI outline, it mentions that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and has operational security measures to remain undetected. It also mentions specific techniques used in command and control communications and exfiltration to avoid detection, such as using HTTPS with custom cryptographic protocols, communicating at select times, and randomizing communication intervals.

Additionally, the malware is designed for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration, which are typical post-exploitation activities in espionage operations.

Given that the malware is designed with operational security in mind, it's reasonable to assume that it would employ tactics to avoid detection before performing more visible activities like system fingerprinting and discovery.

So, in this context, the answer would be A: Yes, it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

But let's consider the alternative, B: No. If I choose B, I would need a reason why Longhorn's tools wouldn't follow tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery.

However, based on the information provided, Longhorn is described as operating with a high degree of operational security, suggesting that they do take steps to avoid detection. Therefore, choosing B wouldn't align with the information given in the CTI outline.

Hence, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
