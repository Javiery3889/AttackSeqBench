Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack attributed to the Lazarus group, specifically focusing on a new backdoor called Vyveva. The outline breaks down the attack into several MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. There's also some additional context about the threat actor and their activities.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics provided in the outline. Let's go through each section:

1. **Execution**: The Vyveva backdoor executes via a service and uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution. This suggests that the initial execution happens through a system service, which is a common method for maintaining access and executing code with system privileges.

2. **Persistence**: The installer creates a new service for persistence, specifically for its loader. This means that even after system reboots, the loader will start automatically, ensuring the backdoor remains active.

3. **Defense Evasion**: This section lists several techniques used by Vyveva to avoid detection:
   - Decrypting strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library.
   - Timestomping files to alter their timestamps and make them look legitimate.
   - Masquerading tasks or services to blend in with normal system processes.
   - Modifying the registry to store configuration settings.
   - Using encrypted strings and components to obfuscate its activities.

4. **Discovery**: The backdoor gathers various types of information about the system and its environment:
   - File and directory listings.
   - List of running processes.
   - System information like computer name, OS version, and architecture.
   - Local IP address.
   - System time and time zone.

5. **Command and Control (C2)**: Vyveva communicates with its C2 server over Tor, encrypting the traffic with XOR. It also exfiltrates data to the C2 server.

6. **Exfiltration**: The backdoor exfiltrates data to the C2 server, which aligns with its capability to collect and send information externally.

Additionally, the "Others" section provides context about the threat actor, indicating that Lazarus is behind this attack and that the backdoor has been active since December 2018. It also mentions that the initial compromise vector is unknown but suggests targeted deployment.

Now, the question is: "After obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery, is Vyveva's backdoor likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files before compressing the collected files and sending them to the C&C server?"

The answer choices are simply "A: Yes" and "B: No."

To answer this, I need to evaluate whether the described sequence of actions aligns with the capabilities and behaviors outlined in the CTI report.

First, let's look at what the backdoor is known to do based on the outline:

- It gathers various system information as part of the Discovery phase.

- It exfiltrates data to the C2 server.

- It can execute files using CreateProcessA.

- It has capabilities for persistence via services.

- It uses Tor for C2 communication and encrypts traffic with XOR.

- It employs several defense evasion techniques to hide its presence.

The question is asking about a specific sequence of actions:

1. Collect files from newly inserted removable media.

2. Notify the C&C about these files.

3. Compress the collected files.

4. Send them to the C&C server.

From the outline, we know that Vyveva can exfiltrate data to the C2 server, which includes sending information externally. However, the specific details about what types of data it collects and how it handles them are not fully specified in the outline.

Let's analyze each step:

1. **Collect files from newly inserted removable media**: The outline mentions that Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings, but it doesn't specifically state that it monitors or collects files from removable media. While it's possible that such a capability exists, it's not directly mentioned in the provided information.

2. **Notify the C&C about these files**: The backdoor is capable of communicating with the C2 server and likely reports various types of information, including system details it gathers during the Discovery phase. However, whether it specifically notifies about new files on removable media isn't specified.

3. **Compress the collected files**: The outline doesn't mention any file compression capabilities. While it's plausible that a backdoor might compress files to reduce the size of exfiltrated data, this specific functionality isn't noted in the provided details.

4. **Send them to the C&C server**: Exfiltration to the C2 server is confirmed, but again, without specific details about the types of data being exfiltrated or how they are prepared before transmission.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention monitoring removable media, notifying the C2 about specific files, compressing files, or the exact methods used for exfiltration beyond the general statement of data exfiltration, I have to rely on the information provided to make an inference.

Considering that the backdoor is sophisticated and employs various evasion techniques, it's possible that it could include such functionalities. However, since the outline doesn't specify these particular actions, I cannot confirm with certainty that Vyveva performs this sequence of steps.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the answer is "B: No" â€“ it is not likely that Vyveva's backdoor follows this specific sequence of actions, as they are not detailed in the outline.

**Final Answer: B**
