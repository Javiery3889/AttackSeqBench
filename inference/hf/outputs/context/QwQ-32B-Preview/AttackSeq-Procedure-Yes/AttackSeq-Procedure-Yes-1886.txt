Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials, and ultimately facilitating fraudulent money transfers. So, they're pretty stealthy and patient, with a median dwell time of over two and a half years, which is way longer than usual for financially motivated hackers.

First, I need to understand their attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's break it down step by step.

**Reconnaissance:** They've been tracking FIN13 since 2017, but activities started in 2016. They target specific industries in Mexico and have a long-term approach, indicating they do thorough reconnaissance to understand their victims' networks and operations.

**Initial Access:** They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. Specific vulnerabilities aren't clear because of the long dwell times and lack of evidence, but web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

**Execution:** They use JSPRAT for executing commands, uploading/downloading files, and proxying network traffic. Also, they have passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE that listen for HTTP requests and execute commands via cmd.exe.

**Persistence:** They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

**Privilege Escalation:** They use common techniques like dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.

**Defense Evasion:** They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivoting, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon functionalities.

**Credential Access:** They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. Trojanized KeePass is used to log newly entered passwords.

**Lateral Movement:** They use WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement, along with custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

**Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using various utilities and libraries, focusing on data that helps in fraudulent transactions.

**Command and Control:** They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

**Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After executing lateral movement using WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, is it likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's recall that after lateral movement, the next steps in the MITRE ATT&CK framework are usually related to maintaining access, privilege escalation, and data collection.

From the outline, we see that FIN13 performs extensive network mapping and credential harvesting. They are patient and stay in networks for a long time, suggesting that they take their time to understand the environment before proceeding with their objectives.

Given that, it's plausible that after gaining access to new systems via lateral movement, they would gather information about the network and host configurations to better navigate the environment and identify valuable data sources.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz for privilege escalation and credential access, which implies that they are interested in understanding the system's security posture and available privileges.

Also, they use custom malware with recon functionalities, such as DRAWSTRING, which suggests that reconnaissance is an integral part of their operation.

Therefore, it makes sense that after lateral movement, they would conduct reconnaissance on the newly accessed systems to understand what data is available and how to access it securely without being detected.

Furthermore, staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions implies that they need to know where sensitive data is stored. This requires knowledge of the network and host configurations.

Hence, gathering information on network and host configurations before staging collected data seems like a logical step in their attack sequence.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

It's likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions.

**Final Answer: A**
