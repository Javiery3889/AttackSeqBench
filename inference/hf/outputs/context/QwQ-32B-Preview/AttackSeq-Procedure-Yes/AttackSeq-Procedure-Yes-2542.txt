Alright, I've got this CTI outline here about an attack by Deep Panda, a Chinese APT group, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions that the attack started with initial access through exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers. So, that's the entry point. Then, they used PowerShell scripts to download and execute more files, leading to the installation of a malicious DLL called Milestone, which is a backdoor based on Gh0st RAT.

Okay, so the attack sequence according to MITRE ATT&CK tactics would be something like:

1. **Resource Development**: They developed their tools and prepared the attack.

2. **Initial Access**: Exploited Log4Shell in VMware Horizon.

3. **Execution**: Used PowerShell to run scripts and download syn.exe and 1.dll.

4. **Persistence**: Installed the Milestone backdoor as a service to maintain access.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: Created a new admin user to run another instance of the backdoor.

6. **Defense Evasion**: Used a kernel rootkit called Fire Chili to hide their activities and employed packing and masquerading techniques.

7. **Discovery**: The backdoor gathered system information and took screen captures.

8. **Exfiltration**: Sent the collected data back to their C2 server.

Now, the question is: "After employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, is it likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over the application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel?"

So, I need to determine if, after discovering system information and capturing screens, the backdoor communicates with the C2 server using an application layer protocol before exfiltrating the data through the same channel.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide between these two.

First, let's think about what the backdoor is capable of. According to the outline, the Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture. It also exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

So, it makes sense that after gathering this information, it would communicate with the C2 server to send this data.

Now, the question is about whether it's likely to communicate over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

Well, C2 communications typically happen over application layer protocols, like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc. So, if the backdoor is exfiltrating data through the C2 channel, it's probably using one of these protocols.

Therefore, it's likely that after gathering the system information and screen captures, it would communicate with the C2 server using an application layer protocol to send that data.

But let's consider if there's any information in the outline that might suggest otherwise.

The outline mentions that the backdoor is based on Gh0st RAT and is packed with Themida. It also mentions that it creates a service and masquerades as a legitimate DLL. Additionally, there's a kernel rootkit involved that hides various artifacts.

However, there's no specific mention of the protocol used for C2 communications. It just says that it exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

Given that, it's reasonable to assume that the C2 communications are over an application layer protocol, as that's a common method for such backdoors.

Moreover, the fact that FortiEDR detected and blocked these threats suggests that they have signatures or behaviors associated with known malicious activities, which often include C2 communications over application layer protocols.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's likely that the Milestone backdoor communicates with the C2 server over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same channel.

So, the answer should be A: Yes.

But just to be thorough, let's consider why B: No might not be the correct answer.

If I choose B: No, that would mean that after discovery and screen capture, the backdoor does not communicate with the C2 server over an application layer protocol before exfiltrating data through the same channel.

But that doesn't make much sense because exfiltration typically requires communication with the C2 server, and that communication is usually over an application layer protocol.

There's no indication in the outline that suggests the exfiltration happens through a different method, like steganography or something else not involving C2 communication.

Therefore, choosing B would contradict the typical behavior of such backdoors and the information provided in the outline.

Hence, the correct answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
