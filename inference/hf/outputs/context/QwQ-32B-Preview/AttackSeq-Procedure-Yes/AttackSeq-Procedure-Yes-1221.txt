Alright, I've got this CTI outline here, and a question about a sequence of tactics used by these attackers. Let's see what it's all about.

First, the CTI outline describes an attack where the bad guys got into networks using Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software. They used valid user credentials that they had stolen, which is pretty sneaky because it's hard to detect when someone is using legitimate login details.

Once they were in, they executed some malware called Trochilus, which communicates back to their command and control servers using encryption to hide what they're doing. They also used another backdoor called UPPERCUT, which is unique to this group, APT10.

Then, they escalated their privileges on the network. That means they tried to get higher-level access, maybe admin rights, so they could do more damage or access more sensitive information. They used a technique called DLL sideloading to deliver their malware. That's where they trick the system into loading their malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.

To avoid detection, they again used DLL sideloading to execute a legitimate binary that loads their renamed malicious DLL. This DLL then decrypts, decompresses, and injects the Trochilus payload into memory. It's a pretty sophisticated way to hide their activities.

Next, they accessed credentials. They used a tool called Mimikatz, which is known for stealing credentials from memory. They also got into Visma's Active Directory domain controller and deployed Trochilus there. They even copied the NTDS.DIT database file, which contains password hashes for all users in the domain. That's a goldmine for attackers.

Then, they moved laterally within the network, logging in via Citrix servers using valid user accounts. The login times suggest they were operating from a timezone consistent with Tianjin, China, which is interesting for attribution purposes.

In the collection phase, they compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated it to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.

Finally, their command and control communications used encrypted channels with RC4 and Salsa20 ciphers, and they had a C2 domain named www.miphomanager[.]com.

Now, the question is: After compressing proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase, is it likely that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Hmm, so I need to decide between yes and no based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's look at what the outline says about exfiltration. It mentions that they compressed the data using WinRAR and exfiltrated it to a Dropbox account using cURL for Windows.

So, in the Collection phase, they compressed the data, and in the Exfiltration phase, they used cURL to upload it to Dropbox.

The question is asking if it's likely that they used custom malware for exfiltration to Dropbox and then used cURL to upload the exfiltrated files.

Wait, but according to the outline, they used cURL for Windows to exfiltrate the files to Dropbox. It doesn't mention anything about using custom malware for exfiltration to Dropbox.

So, based on the information provided, it seems that they directly used cURL for exfiltration, not custom malware.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No, it's not likely that they used custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and then used cURL to upload them, because according to the outline, they used cURL for exfiltration.

But let's double-check.

In the outline, it says: "collection: APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool."

So, exfiltration was done using cURL for Windows, not custom malware.

Therefore, the statement in the question that they would use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and then use cURL to upload them doesn't match the outline.

Hence, the correct answer is B: No.

It's not likely, because according to the CTI outline, they used cURL directly for exfiltration, not custom malware.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
