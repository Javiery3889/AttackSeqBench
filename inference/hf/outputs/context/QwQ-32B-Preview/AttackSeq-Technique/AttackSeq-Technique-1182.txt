I have a CTI outline that describes a cyber attack campaign similar to MuddyWater, targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, with a focus on government and telecommunications companies in Tajikistan. The attack uses social engineering in documents to trick victims into enabling macros and activating payloads. The payloads can be embedded in the documents or downloaded from the internet. There's also a Java-based lure with a key generator that bundles a Java downloader, but the payload is the same as in other lures.

After the payload is executed, two files are created in the ProgramData directory within randomly named directories. A VBS script is used to execute a PowerShell script, and the path to this VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence. In some campaigns, two files are dropped: a VBS script and a base64 encoded text file that decodes into a PowerShell script. In the latest version, three files are dropped: an .sct scriptlet file, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file. The scriptlet and inf files use public code to bypass AppLocker.

The PowerShell script has multiple layers of obfuscation and is divided into three parts: global variables (like paths and encryption keys), functions for encryption, and a backdoor function. This backdoor function collects machine information, takes screenshots, and sends this data to a command and control (C&C) server while waiting for further commands.

The persistence mechanism adds the VBS script path to the task scheduler. Defense evasion techniques include obfuscation of the PowerShell script and using publicly available code to bypass AppLocker. The discovery and collection tactics involve gathering machine information and screenshots.

Additionally, there are some interesting notes: the attackers are actively monitoring the C&C server, as evidenced by a personalized threat to a researcher who made an improper request. There's also a hidden message in the PowerShell script written in simplified Mandarin Chinese, which appears if communication with the C&C fails and the script is run from a command line. This could be a false flag to mislead researchers about the attackers' identity.

Now, the question is: After the backdoor collects machine information and screenshots to send data to the C&C server, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurs to enable communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages?

The answer choices are:

A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application

B: T1039 - Data from Network Shared Drive

C: T1102 - Web Service

D: T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer

To answer this, I need to understand what happens after the backdoor collects data and prepares to send it to the C&C server. The question mentions "querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages," so I need to look for an ATT&CK technique that aligns with communicating with external services in a way that involves encryption.

Let's look at each option:

A: T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application: This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access or to maintain access. However, the question is about communication after data collection, not about initial access or maintaining access through exploiting an application. So, this seems less likely.

B: T1039 - Data from Network Shared Drive: This technique involves collecting data from network shared drives. But the question is about communicating with external services to transmit data, not about collecting data from shared drives. So, this doesn't seem to fit.

C: T1102 - Web Service: This technique involves using web requests to a web server to exfiltrate data or receive commands. This sounds promising because it involves communicating with external services, which could include transmitting encrypted messages.

D: T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer: This technique involves transferring tools from an external system into the target network. However, the question is about transmitting data out of the network to the C&C server, not about bringing tools in. So, this seems less relevant.

Given these explanations, option C: T1102 - Web Service, appears to be the most plausible technique for querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages after data collection.

Therefore, the final answer is C: T1102 - Web Service.
