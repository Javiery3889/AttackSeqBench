Alright, I've got this CTI outline about a cyber attack by the Bitter APT group targeting Bangladesh's government. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the outline mentions that this is an "Initial Access" tactic according to MITRE ATT&CK. So, the focus here is on how the attackers gain entry into the victim's system. They've been doing this since August 2021, specifically targeting a elite unit of the Bangladesh government, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) of the police force.

The attack vector is spear-phishing emails sent to high-ranking officers. These emails contain either a malicious RTF document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. These documents are weaponized to exploit known vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, and CVE-2018-0802.

So, when the victim opens the malicious document, it launches the Equation Editor application, which then runs embedded objects containing shellcode to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Now, the question is asking about what happens after the vulnerabilities are exploited through these malicious documents. Specifically, it's asking about which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication.

The answer choices are:

A: T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding

B: T1197 - BITS Jobs

C: T1566 - Phishing

D: T1090 - Proxy

First, let's understand what each of these techniques entails.

A: T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding: This is a method where adversaries use unusual or custom encoding schemes to obfuscate their commands or data, making it harder for defenders to detect or interpret.

B: T1197 - BITS Jobs: This technique involves using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to transfer data in a way that blends in with normal system behavior, making it less likely to be detected by security measures.

C: T1566 - Phishing: This is the practice of sending malicious communications, like emails, designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.

D: T1090 - Proxy: This involves routing network traffic through a proxy server to obscure the origin of the communication or to bypass network security controls.

Given that the question is about concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication, we need to think about techniques that help hide the communication between the compromised system and the C2 server.

Let's eliminate some options first.

Option C, T1566 - Phishing, is already mentioned in the initial access vector. The phishing emails are used to deliver the malicious documents, but once the system is compromised, phishing isn't directly used to conceal C2 communications. So, this might not be the most relevant choice for this specific question.

Option B, T1197 - BITS Jobs, is a technique used for data exfiltration or transferring files in a stealthy manner. While it could be used for C2 communications, it's more commonly associated with data exfiltration. However, it's still a possibility.

Option A, T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding, is directly related to obfuscating data, which could include C2 communications. This seems like a strong candidate because encoding communications in a non-standard way can make them harder to detect by security tools that rely on recognizing known patterns.

Option D, T1090 - Proxy, is also a strong candidate because using a proxy can mask the origin of C2 communications, making it harder to trace back to the actual C2 server.

Now, between A and D, which one is more likely?

Well, both techniques can be used to conceal C2 communications, but they do so in different ways.

Non-standard encoding focuses on making the content of the communications unreadable or unrecognizable, whereas using a proxy focuses on hiding the source or destination of the communications.

Given that the question is about concealing the identity of the C2 server, which likely refers to hiding the destination of the communications, using a proxy would be more directly relevant to achieving that goal.

Non-standard encoding could make the communications harder to decipher, but if the destination IP or domain is visible, it might still be possible to identify the C2 server, especially if it's communicating over standard ports and protocols.

On the other hand, using a proxy can hide the actual C2 server's address by routing communications through intermediate servers, making it more difficult to trace back to the real C2.

Therefore, I think T1090 - Proxy is the most plausible technique for concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication.

But let's consider if there's any information in the CTI outline that might point towards one technique over the other.

The outline details the initial access vector, which is phishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting specific CVEs. It doesn't provide explicit information about how the C2 communications are handled after the system is compromised.

However, given that the attackers are part of the Bitter APT group, which is known for its sophistication, it's likely that they would employ techniques to hide their C2 servers to maintain persistence and avoid detection.

Using a proxy is a common method among APT groups to obfuscate the location of their C2 servers.

Non-standard encoding is also used, but it's more about hiding the content of the communications rather than the destination.

Therefore, based on the need to conceal the identity of the C2 server, which implies hiding the destination of the communications, T1090 - Proxy is the most appropriate choice.

So, my final answer is D: T1090 - Proxy.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{D} \]
