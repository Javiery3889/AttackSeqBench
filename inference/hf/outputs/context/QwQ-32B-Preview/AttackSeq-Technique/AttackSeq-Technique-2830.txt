Alright, I've got this CTI outline about a malware campaign involving a new RAT called BlackSoul, attributed to the threat actor ReconHellcat. The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a CAB archive that impersonates a document from the NIST website. The malicious loader, 1-10-20-hb44_final.exe, uses obfuscation techniques similar to previous campaigns and retrieves two files: an executable named blacksoul and a DLL named blacksoulLib.

So, the attack sequence according to MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access: Spear phishing email with a malicious CAB archive.

2. Execution: The loader executes, retrieves and runs the blacksoul executable and loads the blacksoulLib DLL.

3. Defense Evasion: The malware uses obfuscation techniques to hide its presence.

4. Credential Access: The DLL searches for browser data and gathers information to communicate with the C2 server.

5. Collection: BlackSoul can transfer files and run arbitrary commands, handling various tasks based on C2 commands.

6. Command and Control: Communication is over RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding, using Cloudflare Workers Service for C2 infrastructure and DNS-over-HTTPS for additional security.

Now, the question is: After BlackSoul established communication with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to transfer data over the C2 channel?

The answer choices are:

A: T1558.001 - Golden Ticket

B: T1048.001 - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol

C: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration

D: T1560 - Archive Collected Data

First, let's understand what each of these techniques entails:

A: T1558.001 - Golden Ticket: This is related to Kerberos authentication, where an attacker obtains a golden ticket to move laterally within a network without needing to reauthenticate. It doesn't directly relate to data exfiltration over a C2 channel.

B: T1048.001 - Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol: This involves exfiltrating data using symmetric encryption over a non-command and control channel. However, in this case, the data is being transferred over the C2 channel, which contradicts the "non-C2 Protocol" part.

C: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration: This technique involves the malware automatically exfiltrating data without user interaction, which aligns well with the capabilities of BlackSoul as described in the Collection phase.

D: T1560 - Archive Collected Data: This involves compressing or archiving data before exfiltration to reduce size or evade detection. While this might be a step in the process, the question is specifically about the technique used to transfer data over the C2 channel.

Given the information in the CTI outline, BlackSoul is capable of file transfers and running arbitrary commands, and it communicates with the C2 server using RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding. The question is focusing on the technique used to transfer data over this C2 channel.

Looking back at the answer choices:

- A: Golden Ticket is not relevant here as it pertains to Kerberos tickets and lateral movement, not data exfiltration.

- B: Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol doesn't fit because the data is being exfiltrated over the C2 channel, not a non-C2 protocol.

- C: Automated Exfiltration aligns well with the capabilities described, as BlackSoul can automatically transfer files and exfiltrate data once it has established communication with the C2.

- D: Archive Collected Data might be a step before exfiltration, but it doesn't describe the act of transferring the data over the C2 channel.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1020 - Automated Exfiltration.

However, let's double-check to ensure there isn't any misinterpretation. The outline mentions that BlackSoul can "retrieve specified files from the machine and upload them to the C2." This sounds like exfiltration, and if this process is automated as part of the malware's functionality, then T1020 is indeed the correct choice.

Additionally, the use of RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding suggests a structured and automated way of communicating with the C2 server, further supporting the choice of Automated Exfiltration.

In conclusion, based on the attack sequence and the capabilities of BlackSoul as described in the CTI outline, the most likely ATT&CK technique occurring after establishing C2 communication is T1020 - Automated Exfiltration.

**Final Answer: C**
