Alright, I have this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about a cyber attack that uses a vulnerability in Ghostscript (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files. HWP is a file format used in Hangul Word Processor, which is popular in South Korea. The attack has been going on since mid-2017 and is still active, especially targeting public sectors and cryptocurrency-related organizations. The attackers pretend to be from government institutions or organizations to spread the malware, and there was an increase in activity in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation.

The outline also mentions that there's a collection of malicious HWP file samples from January to May 2020, and these files often impersonate government inquiries or job-related documents, targeting specific professions or groups. Additionally, AhnLab's anti-malware product detects and blocks these HWP malware using specific aliases.

Now, the question is: After targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection, is it likely that attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion?

And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let me try to understand the sequence of events here.

First, the attackers are targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents. This sounds like phishing, where they send fake documents that look like they're from legitimate sources, like government inquiries or job-related documents.

Then, these documents are malicious HWP files that exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) for initial access. So, when the target opens the HWP file, the vulnerability is triggered, and the malware gets executed.

Now, the question is introducing something about simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion. EPS stands for Encapsulated PostScript, which is another file format used for vector graphics.

But in the CTI outline, there's no mention of EPS files or PostScript syntax. The focus is entirely on HWP files exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability.

Wait, but in the "Others" section, it mentions that AhnLab's anti-malware product detects Exploit/EPS.Generic and mentions the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms. So, there is some connection to EPS files, but it's not central to the attack described.

Given that, I need to consider if the attackers are likely to use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion after targeting with impersonated HWP documents.

But the main attack vector is HWP files exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability. The EPS files seem to be a secondary aspect, possibly used in different stages or variants of the attack.

So, is it likely that after collecting information by targeting specific groups with impersonated documents, the attackers will then exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files for initial access, and only after that, use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion?

Hmm.

First, the sequence in the question seems a bit convoluted. It says "only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion."

But according to the CTI outline, the primary method is using malicious HWP files to exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability for initial access.

Defense evasion techniques are usually employed after gaining access to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

So, in a typical attack sequence, initial access is gained first, and then defense evasion techniques are used.

But the question is suggesting that the attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

That seems backwards to me.

Moreover, there's no clear indication in the CTI outline that EPS files are used for defense evasion or that they are used in sequence with the HWP files.

It's possible that EPS files are used in a different part of the attack or perhaps in a separate attack vector.

Given the information provided, I think the answer should be No, it's not likely that attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

The main attack vector is the HWP files exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability, and defense evasion techniques would more likely be used after gaining initial access, not before.

Also, the CTI outline doesn't provide enough information to suggest a sequence involving both HWP and EPS files in the manner described in the question.

Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
