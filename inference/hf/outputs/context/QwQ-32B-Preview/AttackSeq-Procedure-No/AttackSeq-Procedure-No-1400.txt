Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in financial, retail, and hospitality sectors. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they don't deploy ransomware; instead, they use custom passive backdoors and tools for extended periods within victim environments.

So, the outline breaks down their activities according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is a matrix that categorizes different tactics and techniques used by threat actors. Let's go through the outline step by step to understand their modus operandi.

First, under Reconnaissance, it says that FIN13 has been tracked since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They have a median dwell time of 913 days, which is unusually long, and they've been operational for over five years, focusing only on Mexican organizations.

In the Initial Access phase, they exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities they exploit aren't clear due to the long dwell times and lack of evidence.

For Execution, they use JSPRAT, which is a Java-based remote access tool that allows them to execute commands, upload and download files, and proxy network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports to listen for incoming HTTP requests and execute commands via cmd.exe.

Persistence is achieved through various methods: replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and using email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

For Privilege Escalation, they use common techniques, adapting to different victim networks. They've used ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion tactics include using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with reconnaissance functionality.

Credential Access involves techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials. They target unsecured credentials and use trojanized KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

Discovery phase involves using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. They gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

Lateral Movement is performed using WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally. They use utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. Additionally, they use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Collection involves gathering data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely. They archive collected data using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

Exfiltration is done over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries, is FIN13 likely to use DNS Calculation techniques (e.g., multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a command and control port) before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to determine whether FIN13 is likely to use this specific DNS Calculation technique as part of their exfiltration process.

First, let's understand what DNS Calculation techniques are. The example given is multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a command and control port. This seems like a method to dynamically calculate a port number for C2 communications based on the IP address.

So, is this something FIN13 is known to do based on the CTI outline?

Looking back at the outline, under Defense Evasion, it mentions that FIN13 employs tactics like using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion. They also use custom droppers and malware with reconnaissance functionality.

However, there's no explicit mention of using DNS Calculation techniques for determining C2 ports.

But, in the Persistence section, it mentions that they use MAILSLOT for C2 communications, which is an email-based backdoor. So, perhaps their C2 mechanisms don't rely on dynamically calculated ports.

Moreover, in the Exfiltration phase, it states that they exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories. This suggests that they use web-based methods for exfiltration, possibly over standard HTTP or HTTPS ports, which are 80 and 443, respectively.

Given that, it doesn't seem likely that they would need to calculate ports dynamically, as they're using web services on standard ports.

Additionally, using a technique like DNS Calculation to determine ports could be risky, as it might raise red flags during network monitoring, especially if the ports are non-standard.

FIN13 is known for their stealth and long dwell times, so they likely prefer methods that blend in with normal network traffic.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it doesn't seem that FIN13 uses such DNS Calculation techniques for determining C2 ports.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

But, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any indirect evidence or hints that might suggest otherwise.

Looking back at the Persistence section, it mentions that they use MAILSLOT for C2 communications via email. This suggests that they have multiple C2 methods, including email, which doesn't involve port calculations.

In the Execution phase, they use JSPRAT, which is a web-based backdoor, likely operating over standard web ports.

In the Lateral Movement phase, they use WMI and custom web shells, again, likely over standard ports.

Moreover, in the Exfiltration phase, they use web shells and JSP tools over web services, which typically use standard ports.

There's no mention of them using non-standard ports or dynamically calculating ports for their C2 communications.

Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that FIN13 does not use DNS Calculation techniques for determining C2 ports as part of their exfiltration process.

So, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
