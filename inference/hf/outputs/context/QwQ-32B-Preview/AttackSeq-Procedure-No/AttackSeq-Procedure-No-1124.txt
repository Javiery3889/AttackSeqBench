To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of events during the cyber attack. The question is asking whether, after the initial access gained through a spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119, the Flash file 'show.swf' is likely to downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload embedded in the GIF image.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Date: July 8, 2015
   - Method: Spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government
   - Vulnerability Exploited: CVE-2015-5119 (Adobe Flash vulnerability)
   - Attack Vector: Link to a Flash exploit hosted on rpt.perrydale[.]com and report.perrydale[.]com
   - IP Address: 194.44.130.179 (Ukrainian IP, likely through DNS hijacking)
   - Payload: 'show.swf' and 'b.gif'

2. **Execution:**
   - 'show.swf' contains ActionScript to execute shellcode for installing a payload
   - ActionScript classes: MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, ShellWin32.as
   - 'TryExpl' function in MyClass.as creates a use-after-free condition to exploit CVE-2015-5119
   - Shared functions with a previous UPS attack exploiting CVE-2015-3113
   - Data type manipulation, logging, and decrypting shellcode are part of the exploit

3. **Others:**
   - Similarities with a previous attack attributed to APT group UPS or APT3
   - ActionScript classes and log messages indicate attribution to UPS
   - Payload extraction and decryption technique from an animated GIF image similar to CVE-2015-3113 attacks
   - Shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 are 99% similar
   - APT group UPS quickly leverages new vulnerabilities
   - SHA256 for the Flash exploit: a2fe113cc13acac2bb79a375f692b8ba5cc2fa880272adc7ab0d01f839e877ff
   - Domains involved: rpt.perrydale[.]com, report.perrydale[.]com, IP 194.44.130.179

Now, let's look at the question:

"**After the spear-phishing attack leveraging a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119, is it likely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image?**"

Answer Choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if the attack sequence includes NTLM downgrade and hash capture before installing the payload from the GIF image.

From the CTI outline:

- The initial access is through a spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119 in Adobe Flash.

- The exploit is contained in 'show.swf', which executes shellcode to install a payload.

- The payload is embedded in a GIF image named 'b.gif'.

- The ActionScript classes and functions are detailed, but there is no mention of NTLM downgrade or hash capture.

- The attack is attributed to APT group UPS or APT3, which is known for using similar techniques in previous attacks.

Given this information, there is no direct indication that the attack includes NTLM downgrade and hash capture. The outline focuses on the initial access through the Flash exploit and the execution of shellcode to install the payload from the GIF image.

NTLM downgrade attacks are typically associated with network-based attacks, where an attacker downgrades the authentication protocol to capture NTLM hashes, which can then be used for pass-the-hash attacks. However, in this scenario, the initial access is through a client-side exploit (Flash vulnerability), and the sequence described does not include any network-based authentication steps that would involve NTLM.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, it is unlikely that the Flash file 'show.swf' would downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes as part of this specific attack sequence. The main objectives appear to be exploiting the Flash vulnerability to execute shellcode and install the payload from the GIF image.

Hence, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
