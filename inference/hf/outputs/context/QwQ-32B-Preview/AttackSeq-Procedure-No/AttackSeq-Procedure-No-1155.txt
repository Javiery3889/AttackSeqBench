I have a CTI outline here that describes a cyber attack targeting Instagram users, particularly influencers. The attack involves initial access through phishing and credential access via phishing sites. The question is about the sequence of tactics used by the attackers after compromising the accounts. Specifically, it asks whether it's likely that attackers will collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. According to the outline:

1. **Initial Access**: Attackers target Instagram users, especially influencers, by impersonating technical support or friends. They use phishing emails or messages through platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram itself. These messages contain generic greetings and lure victims with claims of copyright violations or offers of verified badges. The goal is to get victims to visit phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface to capture their credentials.

2. **Credential Access**: Once the attackers have the victims' usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials from the phishing sites, they change the account passwords, locking out the original owners. They also download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

Now, the question is: After locking out the original owners by changing the passwords, is it likely that the attackers will collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts?

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to evaluate these choices based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's consider what typically happens in such attacks. Usually, the sequence is:

- Attackers send phishing messages to victims,诱骗他们点击链接并输入他们的凭据。

- Once the credentials are collected through the phishing sites, attackers gain access to the accounts.

- Attackers then change the passwords to lock out the original owners.

- At this point, attackers might demand ransom payments from the victims in exchange for returning control of the accounts.

In the CTI outline, it's mentioned that attackers change the passwords and download account data after obtaining the credentials through phishing sites. There's no explicit mention of demanding ransom payments in the outline, but it's a common tactic in such scenarios.

The question is asking whether the attackers collect credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments. Based on the typical sequence I just outlined, this seems backwards. Usually, the phishing happens first to gain access, then the attackers lock out the owners and demand ransom.

Looking back at the outline, the phishing occurs before the password change and data exfiltration. There's no indication that phishing is used after demanding ransom.

Therefore, it's unlikely that attackers would collect credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments. The phishing step is typically前期的，用于初始访问和获取凭据。

Hence, the answer should be "No", which is option B.

To summarize:

- Attackers use phishing to get initial access and credentials.

- They change passwords and lock out owners.

- They may then demand ransom payments.

- Phishing for credentials doesn't occur after demanding ransom; it's a前期步骤。

**Final Answer: B**
