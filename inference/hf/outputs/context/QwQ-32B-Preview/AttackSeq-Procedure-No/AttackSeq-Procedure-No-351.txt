Alright, I've got this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about a cyber attack that happened on February 11, 2016. There were two malicious emails sent to officials at Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Both emails came from the same IP address and had the same attachment: a weaponized RTF document. This RTF exploited CVE-2012-0158 to drop an encoded PE file named svchost.exe, which has downloader functionality.

So, initial access was gained through these emails with malicious attachments. The attachments exploited a vulnerability to drop a downloader. That makes sense.

Next, under Command and Control, it says that the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol to communicate with its C&C servers. Some modules don't have C&C capabilities and rely on the RAT component for exfiltrating data.

From the "Others" section, it's part of an APT campaign called "Operation Transparent Tribe" targeted at Indian diplomatic and military resources. Proofpoint researchers found connections to watering hole sites that dropped the RAT with data exfiltration functions. The campaigns share common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language.

The malware family is modular, and additional payloads are downloaded by the main RAT module for functions like keylogging and stealing browser credentials. Infections happen in stages, starting with a downloader component. The RAT can spy on victims through webcams, steal emails from Outlook, record screens, etc. Some variants support over 40 individual commands.

Alright, so now I have to answer the question: Following the initial access achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file, is it likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to determine if, after the initial access via the malicious RTF and dropping the downloader, the MSIL/Crimson malware will set up C&C using a custom TCP protocol before downloading the full RAT from the specified IP and port.

Let's think about this step by step.

First, the initial access vector is through a weaponized RTF exploiting a vulnerability to drop a downloader. This downloader is likely the first stage of the infection process.

According to the outline, the malware family is modular, and infections typically occur in stages, with the first stage being a downloader component. So, the downloader dropped by the RTF is probably the initial stage.

This downloader is named svchost.exe and has downloader functionality. Its job is likely to reach out to a C&C server to download additional components, including the full RAT.

Now, the question is about whether the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish C&C using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from the specified IP and port.

Given that the downloader's purpose is to fetch additional payloads from the C&C server, it needs to communicate with the C&C server using some protocol. According to the outline, the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communications.

So, it's likely that the downloader uses this custom TCP protocol to communicate with the C&C server to download the full RAT component.

The question specifies "before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001."

Assuming that the downloader needs to establish a C&C connection to download the full RAT, it would need to set up the C&C communication first.

Therefore, it makes sense that the downloader would establish the C&C connection using the custom TCP protocol before attempting to download the full RAT from the specified IP and port.

So, based on this reasoning, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let's double-check.

Is there any information in the CTI outline that contradicts this?

The outline states that the downloader is part of the MSIL/Crimson malware family and that it uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communications.

It also mentions that infections occur in stages, with the first stage being the downloader component.

Therefore, it's logical to conclude that the downloader would establish C&C using the custom TCP protocol before downloading the full RAT component.

Hence, the answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

A
