Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials and sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they don't deploy ransomware; instead, they use custom passive backdoors and tools for extended periods within victim environments.

So, the question is about their sequence of actions, specifically after they exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories. It asks whether it's likely that they would transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication during their command and control phase only after this exfiltration step.

First, I need to understand the sequence of their attack based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline.

Starting with Reconnaissance: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on Mexico and specific industries, which suggests they have a clear target selection process.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

Execution: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and proxying network traffic. Also, they use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server to listen for incoming requests and execute commands.

Persistence: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

Privilege Escalation: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with reconnaissance functionality.

Credential Access: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. They use trojanized KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Collection: They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely, archiving collected data using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

Command and Control: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

Others: Their operations have a median dwell time of 913 days, which is much longer than typical financially motivated actors. They've been operational for over five years, targeting only organizations in Mexico. Their endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. They haven't deployed ransomware and remain focused on traditional cybercrime.

Now, the question is: After FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services by using web shells and JSP tools hosted in web-accessible directories, is it likely that they would transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication during their command and control phase only after this exfiltration step?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand the sequence implied in the question. It says "after exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools, is it likely that they would transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication during their command and control phase only after this exfiltration step?"

So, the sequence suggested is:

1. Exfiltrate data using web shells and JSP tools.

2. Then, transfer tools into the environment and encode data for command and control.

I need to evaluate if this sequence makes sense based on the CTI outline.

Looking back at the outline:

- Exfiltration is part of the collection phase, where they collect data from network shared drives, stage it, and exfiltrate it, possibly over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

- Command and control is a separate phase where they maintain communication with compromised systems, possibly transferring tools and encoding data for stealth.

Now, does the exfiltration happen before or after they set up command and control channels?

From the outline, it seems that they first gain initial access using web shells and custom malware, then set up persistence, escalate privileges, perform discovery, move laterally, collect data, and then exfiltrate it.

So, the command and control activities, including transferring tools and encoding data, are likely part of maintaining their access and controlling the compromised systems throughout the intrusion, not necessarily after exfiltration.

In fact, to exfiltrate data, they need to have command and control channels established beforehand to send the exfiltration commands and transmit the data out.

Therefore, it's more logical that they set up command and control, including transferring tools and encoding data for communication, before exfiltrating data, not after.

So, the sequence should be:

1. Set up command and control, transferring tools and encoding data for communication.

2. Use these established channels to exfiltrate data.

Hence, the answer should be B: No, it's not likely that they would transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication during their command and control phase only after exfiltrating data.

They need to have the command and control infrastructure in place before they can exfiltrate data.

Additionally, the outline mentions that they use web shells and JSP tools for initial access and execution, but command and control involves more than just exfiltration; it includes maintaining access, issuing commands, and managing the compromised systems.

Therefore, the command and control activities, including tool transfers and data encoding, are likely ongoing throughout the intrusion, starting from the initial access phase.

So, the correct answer is B: No.

Final Answer: B
