To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers in the Instagram hacking campaign. The outline provides details on the initial access and credential access phases, which are crucial for understanding the attackers' activities.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

**Initial Access:**

- Date: July 12, 2021

- Reporter: Jindrich Karasek from Trend Micro

- Target: Instagram users, particularly influencers

- Method: Cybercriminals impersonated technical support or friends of the victims.

- Delivery vectors: Phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram messages.

- Lure: Generic greetings, claims of copyright violations, or offers of verified badges to entice victims to provide credentials on phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface.

**Credential Access:**

- Attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.

- After obtaining credentials, they changed the account passwords, locking out the original owners.

- They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

Now, let's look at the question:

"**After collecting victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites, is it likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords?**"

Answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to consider the sequence of actions the attackers are likely to take after gaining access to the victims' accounts.

From the CTI outline, we know that after obtaining the credentials:

1. The attackers change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.

2. They download all images and messages from the accounts, possibly using Instagram's data backup feature.

The question is asking whether, before changing the passwords, the attackers are likely to stop specific services related to backups.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Understanding Backups:**

   - Instagram likely has a data backup feature that allows users to export their data, including photos, messages, etc.

   - Attackers might want to access this data for various purposes, such as selling it, using it for further phishing attempts, or extorting the victim.

2. **Stopping Backup Services:**

   - If attackers stop backup services, they might prevent the original owners from backing up their data elsewhere or from restoring their account data if they manage to regain access.

   - However, stopping backup services might also alert the platform or the user to unusual activity, which could be counterproductive for the attackers.

3. **Sequence of Actions:**

   - The outline states that attackers download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through the backup feature, after changing the passwords.

   - This suggests that they perform the data extraction after gaining full control of the account by changing the passwords.

   - Therefore, it's unlikely that they would stop backup services before changing the passwords because their primary goal is to lock out the original owners and access the account data.

4. **Likelihood of Stopping Backup Services:**

   - There is no indication in the CTI outline that the attackers manipulate backup services in any way.

   - The focus is on collecting credentials, changing passwords, and downloading data.

   - Manipulating backup services does not seem to be a part of their documented TTPs in this campaign.

5. **Rationale:**

   - The attackers' main objectives appear to be taking over the account and exfiltrating data.

   - Stopping backup services might be an additional step that could draw attention or is not necessary for achieving their goals.

   - Therefore, it is less likely that they would perform this action before changing the passwords.

Based on this analysis, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
