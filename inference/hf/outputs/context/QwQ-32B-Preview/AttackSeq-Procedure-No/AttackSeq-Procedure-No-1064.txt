Alright, I have this CTI outline about a threat actor called Yellow Garuda, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about Yellow Garuda, which is also known by other names like Charming Kitten, PHOSPHORUS, and UNC788. They've been active since 2012 and are based in Iran. Their main activity is cyber attacks, specifically spoofing login pages to steal credentials. Recently, they've also started using Android malware called 1PINEFLOWER to exfiltrate data from mobile devices.

In terms of their attack methods, the outline mentions that they use macro-enabled template files for initial access. This is a new tactic observed in March 2022, where they use remote template injection to execute malicious macros. These documents are hosted on services like Dropbox or AWS, and they likely use phishing to get victims to download and open them.

Once they gain access, they maintain persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template with their malicious one. This means every time the victim opens Word, the malicious template loads.

They're also into credential access, using phishing sites and a Telegram 'grabber' tool to exfiltrate data from Telegram accounts. This tool can collect messages, media, group memberships, and contact data, store it in a SQLite database and JSON format, and even delete messages from the victim's account.

Regarding exfiltration, it's clear that they transfer this collected data over the web.

Additionally, there's some information about their operational security (OPSEC) mistakes, where an open directory exposed some of their tools and procedures. There's also a surveillance report that gives insights into their data collection objectives and internal structure.

Now, the question is: After maintaining persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template with a malicious macro-enabled template file, is Yellow Garuda likely to use right-to-left override to obfuscate the filenames of malicious email attachments for defense evasion?

I need to choose between "Yes" and "No."

To answer this, I need to see if the CTI outline provides any information about Yellow Garuda using right-to-left override or any similar techniques for obfuscation.

Looking back at the outline, I see that they use macro-enabled template files and have expanded to Android malware. They use phishing to deliver these templates, hosted on third-party services.

But nowhere in the outline does it mention them using right-to-left override or any specific methods to obfuscate filenames.

Right-to-left override is a technique where special characters are used to make filenames appear different from what they actually are, often to trick users into opening malicious files. For example, a file might appear to be an innocent image file, but actually, it's an executable.

Given that the outline doesn't mention this technique, and based on the information provided, I don't see any evidence that Yellow Garuda uses right-to-left override for filename obfuscation.

Therefore, the answer should be "No."

But let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.

The outline does say that they use phishing to get victims to download and open the documents. It's possible that they use various social engineering tactics, including filename obfuscation, to make the attachments look benign.

However, specifically regarding right-to-left override, there's no mention of it in the outline.

So, based on the information given, I don't see any reason to believe that Yellow Garuda uses right-to-left override for this purpose.

Hence, the answer is "No."

**Final Answer: B**
