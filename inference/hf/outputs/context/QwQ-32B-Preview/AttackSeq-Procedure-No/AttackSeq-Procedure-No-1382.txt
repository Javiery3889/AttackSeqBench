Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they don't deploy ransomware; instead, they use custom passive backdoors and tools for extended periods within victim environments.

So, the question is: After obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, is it likely that FIN13 will delay execution of core functionality using a timer before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the CTI outline.

Starting with Reconnaissance: FIN13 has been tracking victims since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on long-term intrusions, mapping victim networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents. This suggests they take their time to understand the environment before acting.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. Specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

Execution: They use JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Also, they use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports, listening for incoming HTTP requests and executing commands via cmd.exe.

Persistence: They use various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. They also use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

Privilege Escalation: They use common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks. They've used utilities like ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. Additionally, they've employed certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with recon functionality.

Credential Access: They use techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials. They also target unsecured credentials and have used trojanized versions of KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Collection: They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely. They also archive collected data using utilities and libraries, targeting specific data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

Command and Control: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They also transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Others: Their operations have a median dwell time of 913 days, which is much longer than typical financially motivated actors. They have an operational lifespan of over five years, targeting only organizations in Mexico. Their endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. Despite the rise of ransomware, they haven't deployed ransomware and remain focused on traditional cybercrime.

Now, looking at the question: After obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, is it likely that FIN13 will delay execution of core functionality using a timer before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells?

So, the sequence here is:

1. Obtain credentials using specific techniques (process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries).

2. Delay execution of core functionality using a timer.

3. Move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

I need to determine if this sequence is plausible based on the CTI outline.

First, let's confirm if FIN13 uses the mentioned techniques for credential access and lateral movement.

From the outline:

- Credential Access: They use process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials. So, yes, they use these techniques.

- Lateral Movement: They use WMI for remote command execution and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. So, yes, they use these methods for lateral movement.

Now, the question is whether they would delay execution of core functionality using a timer between obtaining credentials and moving laterally.

Looking back at the outline, under Defense Evasion, it mentions that they use passive backdoors for stealth and chaining web shells for complex pivots. Also, they have a long dwell time, indicating a patient approach.

Using a timer to delay execution could be a tactic to avoid detection, perhaps to wait for a specific time when network activity is less likely to be noticed or when certain security controls are less active.

However, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention the use of timers for delaying execution. But since they are known for stealth and long dwell times, it's plausible that they might employ such tactics to remain undetected.

But to make a more informed decision, I need to look for any indicators in the outline that suggest they use timing mechanisms or schedule tasks.

Looking back:

- Under Persistence, they use passive backdoors and trojanized KeePass binaries, which suggest they are focused on maintaining access and collecting credentials over time.

- Under Defense Evasion, they use passive backdoors and legitimate utilities, which again points to a stealthy approach.

- Under Privilege Escalation, they use ProcDump to dump LSASS memory, which is a legitimate utility used in a malicious way.

- Under Lateral Movement, they use WMI and custom web shells, which are common tactics for moving laterally in a network.

But there's no explicit mention of scheduling tasks or using timers to delay execution.

However, in the context of their overall approach, which is patient and focused on avoiding detection, it's possible that they would implement such delays to minimize their footprint and avoid triggering alerts.

Moreover, in cyber operations, it's common to schedule tasks at specific times to coincide with certain activities or to avoid peak monitoring periods. So, while not explicitly stated, it's a plausible tactic for them to use.

Given that, I think the answer is A: Yes, it is likely that FIN13 will delay execution of core functionality using a timer before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells.

But to be thorough, let's consider why B: No might also be a possible answer.

If FIN13 is focused on stealth and long-term access, they might prefer to move slowly and methodically, but without necessarily using timed delays. They could rely on other methods to avoid detection, such as mimicking legitimate user behavior or using living-off-the-land binaries.

Additionally, some groups might consider timed delays unnecessary if they have already established a strong foothold in the network and believe that their activities are sufficiently hidden.

However, given that the outline emphasizes their stealthy approach and long dwell times, using timed delays seems consistent with their modus operandi.

Therefore, I believe the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**
