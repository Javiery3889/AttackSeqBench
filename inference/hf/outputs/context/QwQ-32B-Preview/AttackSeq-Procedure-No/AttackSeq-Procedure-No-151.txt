Alright, I have this CTI outline about an incident involving a threat group called TG1021. They seem to be pretty sophisticated, using a bunch of different techniques to get into systems and move around. My task is to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about whether TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

**Reconnaissance:** The outline mentions that TG1021 performed reconnaissance, but it doesn't provide many details here. Just that they did some kind of recon before launching the attack.

**Initial Access:** They gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks. They used a variety of exploits, including a 0-day vulnerability.

**Execution:** They executed a memory-resident malware called NodeIISWeb.

**Persistence:** To maintain persistence, they used web shells and a custom malware framework that operates mostly in-memory. They also removed disk-resident tools after use to avoid detection.

**Privilege Escalation:** They used various techniques for privilege escalation, including a custom version of the Potato family tools called PotatoEx.dll, and other techniques like dynamic DLL loading, execution, code injection, and token manipulation using ExtDLL.dll.

**Defense Evasion:** They made significant efforts to avoid detection, interfering with logging mechanisms, evading EDRs, and operating mostly in-memory to avoid leaving traces on disk.

**Credential Access:** They modified login webpages to record credentials and save them in plaintext.

**Discovery:** They used publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance. These tools were loaded directly into memory without writing to disk, and after execution, they retrieved output files and deleted them.

**Command and Control:** They established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process. NodeIISWeb allowed them to perform various actions on the affected host.

Now, the question is: After TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase, is it likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory?

So, the question is about the Discovery phase and whether they used SharpHound and PowerSploit during that phase.

Looking back at the outline, under Discovery, it explicitly states that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit, loaded directly into memory without writing to disk, performed their operations, retrieved output files, and then deleted them.

The question is asking about the likelihood of this happening during the Discovery phase, after they have already performed lateral movement.

Hmm. So, lateral movement is a different phase, coming after they have initial access and possibly privilege escalation. Discovery could happen at various points during the attack, not necessarily just at the beginning.

In this case, after lateral movement, it makes sense that they would perform discovery on the new systems they have accessed to understand the environment better, map relationships, and find further targets.

Given that, it's likely that they would use tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit again on these new systems to gather more information.

SharpHound is used for active directory reconnaissance, helping to map out relationships between users, groups, and machines. PowerSploit is a set of scripts for post-exploitation tasks, which can include enumeration and discovery.

So, considering that they used these tools earlier in the attack, it's plausible that they would use them again after lateral movement to gather more information about the new systems and the broader network.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they loaded these tools directly into memory and removed traces after use, which aligns with their defense evasion tactics.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into infected machines' memory, even after lateral movement.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit confusingly. It says, "after TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase, is it likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory?"

So, it's asking about whether, after lateral movement, they performed discovery using these tools.

But the outline already says that they used SharpHound and PowerSploit during the Discovery phase, without specifying when in the attack chain this occurred.

However, in a typical attack sequence, discovery activities can happen multiple times, at different stages, including after lateral movement, to understand the new systems and the network they've moved into.

Given that, and considering that TG1021 has already demonstrated the use of these tools earlier in the attack, it's reasonable to assume that they would use them again after lateral movement to gather more intelligence.

Additionally, the fact that they remove disk-resident tools after use suggests that they are careful about covering their tracks, which aligns with the description of loading tools into memory and deleting output files.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes," they likely performed these actions during the Discovery phase after lateral movement.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I think A: Yes is the correct answer.

**Final Answer: A**
