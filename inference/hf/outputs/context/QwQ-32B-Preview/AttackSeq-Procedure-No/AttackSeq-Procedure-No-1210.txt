Alright, I've got this CTI outline here about some activities by the Turla group, and there's a question about whether PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS after using certain command and control channels. I need to look at the outline, understand what's going on, and then evaluate the answer choices.

First, let's break down the CTI outline. It mentions that Turla is using PowerShell to run malware in memory, which helps them avoid detection because they're not dropping executables on the disk. This is under the Execution tactic in MITRE ATT&CK. So, they're executing code directly in memory using PowerShell.

Next, for Persistence, they're using two methods: WMI event subscriptions and modifying the PowerShell profile. With WMI, they create event filters and consumers to run base64-encoded PowerShell commands that load a script from the registry. The PowerShell profile is altered to run a script every time PowerShell starts, which loads and executes the malware. This ensures that their malware persists across reboots and continues to run.

Under Defense Evasion, it's noted that their PowerShell scripts are designed to evade detection by encrypting payloads and obfuscating scripts. They also use an AMSI bypass technique, which patches the AmsiScanBuffer function in memory to prevent antimalware products from scanning their buffers. This is a way to avoid being detected by security software.

In the Discovery phase, Turla uses two backdoors: RPC backdoor and PowerStallion. These backdoors are used for lateral movement within a network and to control other machines. They can upload and download files and execute commands. The RPC backdoor can also load plugins that gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives. PowerStallion monitors antimalware logs and the process list on the Windows system.

For Collection, the RPC backdoor plugins can collect recent files from the local file system and files from USB drives. PowerStallion is a lightweight PowerShell backdoor that uses Microsoft OneDrive as its command and control server. It can execute additional PowerShell scripts and write command results to another OneDrive subfolder.

Command and Control is handled differently by the two backdoors: the RPC backdoor uses the RPC protocol, while PowerStallion uses OneDrive accessed via SMB.

Now, the question is: After utilizing the RPC protocol and Microsoft OneDrive as command and control channels, is it likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS?

So, I need to determine if PowerStallion exfiltrates data via HTTPS, given that it uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide between these two based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive as its command and control server, accessed via SMB. SMB is the Server Message Block protocol, which is used for sharing files, printers, etc., in a network. OneDrive, being a cloud storage service, can be accessed via various protocols, including SMB.

The question is about exfiltration via HTTPS. HTTPS is a secure way of transferring data over the web, commonly used for secure communications.

So, does PowerStallion exfiltrate data via HTTPS?

From the outline, it says that PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control. It executes additional PowerShell scripts and writes command results to another OneDrive subfolder.

Now, OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS as well, since it's a web-based service. However, in this case, they're using SMB to access OneDrive.

But the question is about exfiltration via HTTPS after using RPC and OneDrive for command and control.

Exfiltration typically involves sending stolen data out of the network to the attackers' servers.

Given that PowerStallion uses OneDrive for command and control, it's possible that exfiltration also occurs through OneDrive. Since OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS, one might think that exfiltration happens via HTTPS.

However, since they're using SMB to access OneDrive for command and control, it's possible that exfiltration also happens via SMB.

But SMB is a different protocol from HTTPS. SMB is a file-sharing protocol, while HTTPS is for web-based communications.

So, is it likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS?

Well, considering that they're already using OneDrive via SMB for command and control, it's possible that exfiltration also happens via SMB.

But OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS as well, so it's possible that they use both protocols for different purposes.

Alternatively, they might use HTTPS for exfiltration separately from the SMB-based command and control.

But the outline doesn't specifically mention how exfiltration occurs.

However, since PowerStallion is a PowerShell backdoor and PowerShell can make web requests via HTTPS, it's possible that it can exfiltrate data via HTTPS.

But the outline doesn't explicitly state that.

On the other hand, the outline mentions that PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control and writes command results to another OneDrive subfolder.

It's possible that exfiltration happens by uploading data to OneDrive via SMB, which would not be HTTPS.

But again, OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS, so it's possible that exfiltration occurs via HTTPS as well.

Given that, I need to make an inference based on the information provided.

The question is: After utilizing the RPC protocol and Microsoft OneDrive as command and control channels, is it likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS?

Given that PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control and writes command results to another OneDrive subfolder, it's possible that exfiltration occurs via SMB.

However, since OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS, and PowerStallion is a PowerShell backdoor that can make web requests, it's also possible that it exfiltrates data via HTTPS.

But the outline doesn't specify the exfiltration method explicitly.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes," meaning it's likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS.

B says "No," meaning it's not likely.

Given that PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control, but OneDrive can also be accessed via HTTPS, and considering that PowerShell can make HTTPS requests, it's plausible that exfiltration could occur via HTTPS.

However, since the outline mentions SMB for command and control and doesn't specify the exfiltration method, I might lean towards "No" because there's no direct evidence suggesting that HTTPS is used for exfiltration.

But the question is about likelihood, and given that OneDrive can be accessed via HTTPS and PowerStallion is a PowerShell backdoor capable of making HTTPS requests, it's possible that they use HTTPS for exfiltration.

Moreover, using HTTPS for exfiltration could be a way to blend in with normal web traffic and avoid detection.

Therefore, even though the outline doesn't explicitly state that PowerStallion exfiltrates via HTTPS, it's plausible based on the capabilities described.

So, considering all that, I think the answer is "Yes," it is likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS.

Final Answer: A
