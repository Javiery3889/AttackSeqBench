Alright, I have this CTI outline from Symantec about some cyber attacks involving the WastedLocker ransomware and the group called Evil Corp. They used something called SocGholish, which is a malicious JavaScript framework, to trick victims into downloading what looks like a software update but is actually malware.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. So, starting with Reconnaissance, the attackers identified U.S. organizations to target. Then, for Initial Access, they used compromised websites to deliver the SocGholish framework, which is a JavaScript-based malicious payload. Victims would download what they think is a browser update, but it's actually a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript.

In the Execution phase, this JavaScript leads to the execution of another JavaScript file using wscript.exe, which profiles the computer and downloads more PowerShell scripts for discovery. So, they're using PowerShell to gather information about the system.

Then, for Privilege Escalation, they used a technique involving slui.exe and wmic.exe to gain higher privileges on the system. For Defense Evasion, they used tools like PsExec to manage Windows Defender, disabling scans and removing definitions to make sure their activities aren't detected.

In the Discovery phase, they used commands like whoami, net user, net group, and even PowerView's Get-NetComputer command to search for computer objects in the Active Directory. This helps them map the network and find valuable targets.

For Lateral Movement, they used Cobalt Strike Beacon to move laterally across the network, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.

Command and Control communications were handled by the injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload talking to a C&C domain associated with WastedLocker.

Finally, the Impact phase involved deploying the WastedLocker ransomware to encrypt computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding ransom.

Now, the question is: After profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group during the discovery phase, is it likely that password spraying via SMB will be used to empty log files before employing lateral movement through commands and process injection on remote computers?

So, I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's break down the question:

1. After discovery phase activities (whoami, net user, net group, and using PowerView).

2. Is password spraying via SMB likely to be used to empty log files.

3. Before employing lateral movement through commands and process injection.

So, I need to see if password spraying via SMB to empty log files is a likely step in this attack sequence based on the information given.

Looking back at the outline:

- In the Discovery phase, they used standard commands to gather information about the system and network.

- For Lateral Movement, they used Cobalt Strike Beacon to move across the network.

- They used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.

But, there's no explicit mention of password spraying or emptying log files.

However, password spraying is a common initial access vector, where attackers try common passwords across many accounts to gain access. SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol often used for sharing files and printers in a network, and it can be used for lateral movement.

Emptying log files could be a defense evasion technique to cover their tracks, preventing administrators from seeing their activities in logs.

Given that, is it likely that they would use password spraying via SMB to empty log files before lateral movement?

Well, password spraying is typically used for initial access, not necessarily for emptying log files. Also, SMB can be used for lateral movement, but the outline specifies that they used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.

Moreover, the outline mentions that they used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services, but not specifically to empty log files.

So, based on the information provided, it doesn't directly support the idea that password spraying via SMB was used to empty log files as part of this attack sequence.

Therefore, I would lean towards "No," it is not likely that password spraying via SMB was used to empty log files before lateral movement.

The attack sequence, as described, involves using SocGholish for initial access, PowerShell for discovery, Cobalt Strike for privilege escalation and lateral movement, and PsExec for defense evasion related to Windows Defender.

There's no indication that password spraying via SMB was part of their tactics in this particular attack campaign.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
