To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and determine whether PROMETHIUM exfiltrates data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase, based on the information given.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the relevant sections.

1. **Initial Access**: PROMETHIUM uses trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.

2. **Execution**: The trojanized installers deploy the malware and a legitimate application. The malware uses a service for persistence and executes a PowerShell command to reconfigure Windows Defender.

3. **Persistence**: A service is created to launch the C2 contact module upon startup, with the service name changing per package.

4. **Defense Evasion**: The malware checks for specific antivirus software and adds exclusions in Windows Defender to evade detection.

5. **Collection**: The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files by parsing the hard drive for specific file extensions, compressing them into an archive, encoding the archive, and sending it to the C2 server.

6. **Command and Control**: Around 30 new C2 domains are identified, hardcoded into the malware, suggesting the use of a Builder tool.

7. **Others**: Information about the threat actor's resilience, global targeting, and possible enterprise service operation.

Now, focusing on the Collection phase, the outline states that the malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files. It uses a document search module to find files with specific extensions, compresses them into an archive, encodes the archive, and sends it to the C2 server.

The question is: After PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module during the Collection phase, is it likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase?

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine the correct answer, I need to see if the CTI outline provides any information about the frequency of data exfiltration.

Looking back at the Collection phase description:

- The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files.

- It parses the hard drive for files with specific extensions.

- It compresses the files into an archive and encodes the archive.

- It sends the archive to the C2 server.

However, there is no mention of the frequency of this exfiltration process. The outline does not specify whether this happens every 10 minutes, daily, or under different conditions.

Since the information about the exfiltration frequency is not provided in the CTI outline, I cannot confirm that exfiltration occurs every 10 minutes. Therefore, the most accurate answer is "No," it is not likely that the malware will exfiltrate data every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase, based on the given information.

**Final Answer: B**
