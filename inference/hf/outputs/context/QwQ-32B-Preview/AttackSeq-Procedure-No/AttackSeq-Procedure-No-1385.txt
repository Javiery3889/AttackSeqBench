Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials and sensitive documents to carry out fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

So, the question is: After FIN13 employs passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports to listen for incoming HTTP requests and execute commands, is it likely that they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries?

Answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events here. The CTI outline mentions several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques used by FIN13. Let's break it down.

Starting with Reconnaissance: FIN13 has been tracked since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on Mexico, especially financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents for fraudulent money transfers.

Initial Access: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK to get a foothold in the network. The specific vulnerabilities they exploit aren't clear due to long dwell times and insufficient evidence. But web shells on external servers are a consistent entry point.

Persistence: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions that log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. They also use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

Privilege Escalation: They use common techniques to gain higher privileges, adapting to different victim networks. They've used ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. Additionally, they've used certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

Defense Evasion: They employ tactics to avoid detection, such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and using legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with reconnaissance functionality.

Credential Access: They use techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and network sniffing to obtain credentials. They target unsecured credentials and use trojanized KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

Discovery: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.

Lateral Movement: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

Collection: They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely, archiving collected data using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

Command and Control: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

Exfiltration: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Others: Their operations have a median dwell time of 913 days, much longer than typical financially motivated actors. They've been operational for over five years, targeting only organizations in Mexico. Their endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. Despite the rise of ransomware, they haven't deployed ransomware and remain focused on traditional cybercrime.

Now, the question is about the sequence of their tactics. Specifically, after employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports for listening to incoming HTTP requests and command execution, is it likely that they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries?

So, let's parse this question. It's asking whether, after setting up a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, FIN13 would then exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, but only after using other methods to establish persistence, such as SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit confusing. Initial access is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, before persistence. So, initial access is how they get into the network in the first place, and persistence is how they maintain access over time.

In the CTI outline, it's mentioned that they exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK for initial access. Then, for persistence, they use tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

So, the question seems to be mixing up the sequence here. It's asking if, after setting up a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, they would exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence.

But according to the outline, initial access is through exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, and persistence is achieved through tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

So, the sequence suggested in the question seems backward. Typically, initial access happens first, followed by establishing persistence.

Let me see if I can rephrase the question to understand it better. It's asking: After using a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, is it likely that they will then exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass for persistence.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because initial access should come before persistence. Maybe the question is trying to say that after establishing persistence with BLUEAGAVE, do they then use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass for further initial access.

But that also doesn't make sense because initial access is the first step. Maybe it's a miswording, and it's actually asking about additional initial access vectors after persistence is established.

Alternatively, perhaps it's asking whether, after setting up persistence with BLUEAGAVE, they would then use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass for further persistence or lateral movement.

But the question specifically mentions "initial access" after persistence is already established, which seems contradictory.

Let me look back at the CTI outline to see if there's any mention of using initial access techniques after persistence is established.

In the "Initial Access" section, it says they exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK to establish a foothold. It doesn't mention using initial access techniques after persistence is established.

In the "Persistence" section, it mentions tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for maintaining access.

So, based on the outline, it seems that initial access is through exploiting external servers with web shells and custom malware, and then they establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

Therefore, the sequence should be:

1. Initial Access: Exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK).

2. Persistence: Use tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries to maintain access.

The question is asking if, after employing a passive backdoor like BLUEAGAVE, they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

This seems to suggest that after setting up BLUEAGAVE, they would then set up persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass before exploiting external servers again for initial access.

But this doesn't make sense because initial access is the first step. Once they've already established initial access and persistence, why would they need to exploit external servers again for initial access?

Maybe the question is trying to say that after setting up BLUEAGAVE, they use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass for additional persistence, and then exploit external servers again for more initial access points.

But that still seems unclear. Perhaps it's better to look at the answer choices.

Option A says "Yes," meaning that it is likely that after employing BLUEAGAVE, they will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

Option B says "No," meaning that it is not likely.

Given the confusion in the question, I need to make an educated guess based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

From the outline, it's clear that initial access is through exploiting external servers with web shells and custom malware, and persistence is established using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass.

It's possible that after gaining initial access and establishing persistence, they might look for additional entry points or ways to maintain access, but referring to these as "initial access" seems incorrect.

Perhaps what the question is trying to get at is whether FIN13 uses a specific sequence of tactics: first, establish initial access with BLUEAGAVE, then set up persistence with SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass, and then exploit external servers again for more initial access.

But this seems like they're creating redundant initial access vectors after already having persistence. While it's possible that threat actors may establish multiple entry points for redundancy, referring to these subsequent
