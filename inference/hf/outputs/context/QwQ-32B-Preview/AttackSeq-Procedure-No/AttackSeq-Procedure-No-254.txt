To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any indication that NanHaiShu creates SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts after gathering system information.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - The threat actor uses spearphishing emails with attachments containing VBA macros.
   - These macros execute JScript files when macros are enabled.

2. **Execution:**
   - The VBA macro decodes and runs JScript data, saving it to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js'.
   - A decoy XLS file is also decoded and loaded to hide the malicious activity.
   - A VBScript file is created to delete the original malicious file.

3. **Persistence:**
   - The malware modifies the registry ('%regrun%') to point to network.js for autostart.

4. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Uses base64 encoding for decoy files and JScript.
   - URL strings are obfuscated in multiple layers.

5. **Discovery:**
   - Gathers system information like Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, and Proxy Server.
   - Uploads this information to the C&C server.

6. **Exfiltration:**
   - Capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code.
   - Potentially used for exfiltrating sensitive data.

Now, looking at the question: "After NanHaiShu gathers system information from infected machines, such as IP Address, Volume Serial Number, and Computer Name, is it likely to create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code?"

Let's analyze this step by step:

- The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.

- It is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code from the C&C server.

- The question is asking whether, after gathering system information, it is likely to create SOCK5 and custom protocol proxies between infected hosts before downloading and executing further scripts.

From the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of creating SOCK5 proxies or custom protocol proxies between infected hosts. The outline details the initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, and exfiltration phases but does not specify the creation of proxies as part of its TTPs.

However, it's worth considering that some malware does use proxies to route traffic or to maintain anonymity, but this would typically be part of the initial access or command and control communication, not necessarily after the discovery phase.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't mention the creation of SOCK5 or custom protocol proxies, and there's no indication in the provided information that this is part of NanHaiShu's TTPs, the most plausible answer is "No."

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
