Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack campaign by Mustang Panda, using a new variant of Korplug called Hodur. The outline provides a lot of details about the attack, from initial access to data exfiltration, mapped against MITRE ATT&CK tactics. My task is to answer a specific question based on this outline, choosing between "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand the question clearly. It asks: "After Mustang Panda's Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages, is it likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives?"

So, breaking this down:

1. The Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, with compressed and encrypted messages.

2. The question is whether, after performing this data exfiltration, it is likely to perform data discovery, like collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

I need to decide if, given the information in the CTI outline, this sequence of actions makes sense.

Let me start by recalling what the CTI outline says about data exfiltration and data discovery.

Under "Command and Control," it mentions that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol. The initial handshake can be over HTTPS or TCP, but subsequent communication is always over TCP. The communication is encrypted using RC4 and may use non-standard ports. The configuration contains fallback C&C servers, and Korplug can download additional files from the C&C server.

Additionally, under "Collection," it states that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It can list files and directories along with their attributes and content, and collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.

So, it's clear that Korplug is designed to collect data from various sources on the system and exfiltrate it to the C&C server using a custom protocol over TCP, with encryption and compression.

Now, the question is about the sequence: does it first exfiltrate data and then perform data discovery?

Wait, that seems a bit backward. Typically, in a cyber attack, the sequence is:

1. Initial access

2. Execution of malware

3. Persistence mechanism setup

4. Data discovery: the malware looks around the system to find valuable data

5. Data exfiltration: the collected data is sent back to the attackers via the C&C channel

So, based on general knowledge of how malware operates, it's the data discovery that happens before data exfiltration.

But let's check the CTI outline to see if there's any specific sequence mentioned.

Under "Discovery," it says that Korplug collects extensive information about the system, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, amount of RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time.

Under "Collection," it details how Korplug collects data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, including files, directories, and their attributes and content.

So, it seems that the data discovery and collection happen before the exfiltration.

Looking back at the question: "After Mustang Panda's Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages, is it likely to perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives?"

Given the typical sequence of malware operations and the information in the CTI outline, it seems that data discovery and collection happen before data exfiltration.

Therefore, the sequence implied in the question—exfiltration followed by data discovery—seems inverted from the expected sequence.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the malware performs exfiltration and then continues to perform data discovery for ongoing data collection.

However, generally, malware would first establish a presence on the system, discover available data, collect it, and then exfiltrate it. It might continue to monitor and collect new data over time, but the initial sequence should be discovery, collection, then exfiltration.

Moreover, the CTI outline doesn't suggest that data discovery happens after exfiltration.

In fact, under "Collection," it says that Korplug collects data from various sources, which implies that this happens as part of its operational cycle, likely before exfiltration.

Therefore, based on both general malware behavior and the specifics provided in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that data discovery occurs after data exfiltration.

So, the answer should be "No."

Wait, but let's consider if there's any scenario where data discovery might occur after exfiltration.

Perhaps, in some cases, malware might exfiltrate some initial data and then, based on feedback from the C&C server, perform further data discovery and collection.

But even in that case, the data discovery would still be preceding the subsequent exfiltration of new data.

The question specifies "after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP," is it likely to perform data discovery.

Given that data discovery is a necessary step before exfiltration, it would be unusual for data discovery to occur after exfiltration, unless the malware is designed to continuously monitor and collect new data over time.

But even then, the initial data discovery would precede the initial exfiltration.

Perhaps the question is trying to test whether the malware can perform data discovery and exfiltration concurrently or in an overlapping manner.

The CTI outline doesn't provide explicit timing information about these activities, but based on standard malware behavior, data discovery typically comes before exfiltration.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is "No," it is not likely to perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
