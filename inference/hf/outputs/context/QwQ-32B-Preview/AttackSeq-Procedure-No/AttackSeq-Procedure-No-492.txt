Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Harvester group and a question regarding their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline.

1. **Initial Access**: The Harvester group started their campaign in June 2021, targeting organizations in South Asia, particularly Afghanistan. The initial infection vector is unknown, but they were first detected through a malicious URL on victim machines.

2. **Execution**: They used a custom backdoor called Backdoor.Graphon, along with other tools like a custom downloader and a screenshot tool to execute commands, capture user activities, and enable remote access.

3. **Persistence**: They set a registry entry to ensure their custom downloader runs at startup, specifically under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\"MicrosoftSystemServices"= "[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\Microsoft Services[.]vbs"`.

4. **Defense Evasion**: They tried to hide their activities by using legitimate infrastructure like CloudFront and Microsoft services for C2 communications and employed a decoy URL to mislead users.

5. **Collection**: The screenshot tool captures images and saves them in a password-protected ZIP archive, deleting archives older than a week.

6. **Exfiltration**: The ZIP archives containing screenshots are likely exfiltrated, though the method isn't specified in the outline.

Now, the question is: "After Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection, is it likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication?"

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

Hmm, so I need to determine whether it's likely that Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon use FTP for C2 communication, especially in the context of the activities described.

Let's think about this.

First, the outline mentions that Harvester attempted to blend their activities with legitimate traffic by using legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C2 activities. This suggests that they prefer to use channels that look normal and expected, to avoid drawing attention to their communications.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that is commonly used for transferring files over a network, but it's not typically used for C2 communications for a few reasons:

1. **Visibility**: FTP is not as commonly used for web traffic as HTTP or HTTPS. Using FTP for C2 could stand out in network traffic analysis.

2. **Encryption**: FTP typically transmits data in plain text, including usernames and passwords, which makes it less secure and more easily detectable by security tools looking for plaintext data transmissions.

3. **Legitimate Use**: While FTP is used in some organizations, it's less common in modern networks, especially for web-based activities. Using FTP for C2 might not blend well with normal traffic patterns.

Given that Harvester is trying to hide their activities by using legitimate infrastructure like CloudFront and Microsoft services, it's more likely that they would use protocols that are commonly associated with these services, such as HTTP or HTTPS.

Additionally, the outline mentions that they used a decoy URL (`hxxps://usedust[.]com`), which suggests they are using HTTPS, further indicating a preference for protocols that are standard and encrypted.

Cobalt Strike Beacon is a well-known tool that can be configured to use various C2 protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and even raw TCP. However, FTP is not a typical choice for Cobalt Strike Beacon, and there's no mention in the outline that suggests FTP is being used.

Backdoor.Graphon is a custom backdoor, so its capabilities are not publicly known, but given the context, it's likely designed to use protocols that blend in with normal traffic.

Therefore, considering the efforts made by Harvester to hide their activities within legitimate traffic and the preferences for protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, it's less likely that they would use FTP for C2 communications.

So, the answer should be:

B: No

**Final Answer: B**
