To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any indication that Agrius deploys CaddyWiper or engages in data destruction activities, particularly targeting OT capabilities and specific drive partitions.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Agrius uses public-facing application exploits, including CVE-2018-13379 and 1-day vulnerabilities.
   - They attempt SQL injection and upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

2. **Execution:**
   - They deploy a custom .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'.
   - This backdoor is used for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware.
   - It's registered as a service for persistence and can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

3. **Persistence:**
   - Webshells and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor are used for persistence.

4. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Webshells are obfuscated with custom base64 encoding.
   - 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces to evade detection.

5. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Webshells are used to tunnel RDP traffic.
   - Compromised accounts are used for lateral movement.
   - Publicly available offensive security tools are used for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

6. **Command and Control:**
   - 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - It awaits commands like updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, looking at the question:

"After the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files, is Agrius likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities along with mapped drives and physical drive partitions as part of its data destruction activities?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To determine the answer, I need to see if the CTI outline suggests that Agrius engages in data destruction activities, specifically using CaddyWiper to target OT capabilities and drive partitions.

Looking back at the outline, there's no mention of CaddyWiper or any data destruction activities. The primary activities described are initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. The backdoor is used for data exfiltration and deploying additional malware, but there's no indication of wiping files or destroying data.

CaddyWiper is a specific type of wiper malware known for its destructive capabilities, but it's not mentioned in the CTI outline. Therefore, based on the information provided, there's no reason to believe that Agrius deploys CaddyWiper or engages in the described data destruction activities.

Hence, the most plausible answer is:

B: No

**Final Answer: B**
