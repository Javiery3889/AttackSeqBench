I've been given this CTI outline about a threat actor called FIN13, and I need to answer a question based on it. The question is about whether FIN13 is likely to use steganography to hide its C2 communications before exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

First, I need to understand what's in the CTI outline. It seems like FIN13 is a group that's been active since 2016, targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers.

Looking at the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They gather information about their targets.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.

3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file operations, and proxying network traffic.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods to maintain access, including trojanized KeePass binaries and backdoors like MAILSLOT.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to escalate privileges and extract credentials.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors and use legitimate utilities to avoid detection.

7. **Credential Access**: They steal credentials through process dumping and network sniffing.

8. **Discovery**: They perform internal network reconnaissance using native tools and custom malware.

9. **Lateral Movement**: They move laterally using WMI and custom web shells.

10. **Collection**: They collect data from network shares and archive it.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

The "Others" section mentions that they have a long dwell time and are focused on traditional cybercrime, not ransomware.

Now, the question is about whether FIN13 is likely to use steganography to hide C2 communications before exfiltrating data over web services.

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data. It's a method to conceal the existence of the communication. Given that FIN13 is focused on long-term access and avoiding detection, using steganography could be beneficial for them to hide their C2 communications.

However, looking back at the CTI outline, there's no explicit mention of steganography being used by FIN13. The methods they use for C2 are mentioned, such as web shells, MAILSLOT backdoors, and custom tools like BLUEAGAVE and JSPRAT.

Given that they already use web shells and other backdoors for C2, which are effective for their purposes, it's not clear whether they additionally use steganography to hide these communications.

Moreover, steganography can be complex to implement and may not necessarily offer additional benefits beyond what their current methods provide, especially since they have a long dwell time, suggesting that their current methods are effective for avoiding detection.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there's no indication that FIN13 uses steganography for hiding their C2 communications.

So, the answer to the question is "No," they are not likely to use steganography for this purpose.

**Final Answer: B**
