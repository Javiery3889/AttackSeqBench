I have this CTI outline about CosmicDuke, which is a type of malware, and there's a question about whether it compresses data using a custom LZW algorithm before sending it via FTP. I need to choose between "Yes" and "No" based on the information provided in the outline.

First, I need to understand what the CTI outline is saying. It describes how CosmicDuke infects systems, how it persists, what kind of credentials it steals, how it discovers files, and how it communicates with its command and control servers.

Starting with the initial access, it says that CosmicDuke tricks victims into opening PDF files with exploits or disguised executable files. It uses social engineering to make these files look benign, like documents or images, and while the user is looking at a decoy, the malware installs in the background.

Next, in the execution phase, it mentions that CosmicDuke uses a similar loader to another malware called MiniDuke. The loader has been updated over time, and CosmicDuke started using the updated version in mid-April 2014.

For persistence, CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service that starts the malware using a duplicated process token. It also copies itself to the system32 folder with various filenames.

In the credential access phase, it targets a wide range of software to steal credentials, including chat clients, web browsers, email clients, and even Windows credentials like LM and NT hashes. It also exports certificates and private keys, encrypting the exported data with the password 'saribas.'

The discovery phase involves searching for files on hard drives and network drives, looking for specific file types and non-English filenames containing words related to encryption.

Regarding command and control, CosmicDuke communicates via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltrating data and updating itself. The configuration, which includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the malware and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

Finally, the exfiltration is done via FTP, and the report details the login credentials and FTP folder structure of the remote sites contacted by CosmicDuke, most of which were live at the time the report was written.

Now, the question is: After searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection, is CosmicDuke likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP?

Looking back at the outline, under the "Command and Control" section, it mentions that the configuration is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1. LZNT-1 is a variant of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm used by Microsoft, but it's not exactly LZW, which is a different compression algorithm.

The question is asking specifically about a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compressing the output data generated by command execution before exfiltration via FTP.

From the outline, we know that CosmicDuke compresses its configuration using something similar to LZNT-1, but there's no explicit mention of using LZW for compressing the collected data before exfiltration.

However, since LZNT-1 is similar to LZW in that both are dictionary-based compression algorithms, it's possible that the malware uses a similar compression method for the exfiltrated data.

But the question is asking about a custom implementation of LZW specifically. Given that the outline mentions compression using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1 for the configuration, it's not directly stating that LZW is used for the exfiltrated data.

Moreover, the exfiltration method is via FTP, and the report details the FTP server structures and credentials, but it doesn't specify any compression method used for the data being sent.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards "No," meaning that it is not likely that CosmicDuke compresses the output data with a custom LZW algorithm before exfiltration.

The evidence suggests that it uses a compression method similar to LZNT-1 for its configuration, but there's no direct indication that it uses LZW for the exfiltrated data.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: B
