To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Waterbear campaign, which is associated with the BlackTech cyberespionage group.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Execution:**
   - The campaign uses a modular malware approach.
   - A DLL loader is used to decrypt and execute an RC4-encrypted payload, typically a first-stage backdoor.
   - This backdoor can receive and load additional executables from external attackers.
   - The infection starts with a malicious DLL loader, which can be triggered by modifying a legitimate server application to import the malicious DLL or through phantom DLL hijacking and DLL side-loading.
   - The loader searches for a hardcoded path to decrypt the payload, which is then injected into an existing Windows Service, such as LanmanServer, run by svchost.exe.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - In a recent campaign, Waterbear used API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific security product.
   - The malware injects code into the security product to hide its network behaviors.
   - The payload uses API hooking to modify the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, thus avoiding detection while the original system DLL files remain unchanged.
   - The API hooking is designed to hide specific processes and TCP endpoint records associated with Waterbear's activities.

3. **Others:**
   - The campaign targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia, specifically Taiwan, and sometimes Japan and Hong Kong.
   - Attackers demonstrate knowledge of the victims' environments and security products, indicating a high level of familiarity with their targets.
   - The API hooking shellcode is generic and could potentially be used to target other security products in the future, making Waterbear harder to detect.

Now, let's look at the question:

**Question:** After Waterbear's backdoor configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities, is it likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if the use of API hooking techniques to modify specific functions in memory is likely to occur after the backdoor has been configured with encryption keys and C&C server addresses.

From the CTI outline, we know that:

- Waterbear uses API hooking to evade detection, specifically modifying 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' functions.

- This technique was observed in a recent campaign to hide network behaviors from a specific security product.

- The API hooking is part of their defense evasion tactics.

Given that the backdoor is already configured with encryption/decryption keys and XOR-encrypted C&C server addresses, it's reasonable to assume that the malware is already set up for communication with the attackers. However, to ensure that its activities remain hidden from security products, it would be logical for the malware to employ additional evasion techniques, such as API hooking.

Therefore, it is likely that after the backdoor is configured, API hooking techniques would be used to evade detection by modifying the specified functions in memory.

Thus, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
