To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any indication that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the lateral movement phase. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the relevant parts.

1. **Reconnaissance**: TG1021 performed reconnaissance by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.

2. **Initial Access**: They gained initial access by exploiting these IIS servers with deserialization attacks, including a 0-day vulnerability.

3. **Execution**: They executed a memory-resident malware called NodeIISWeb.

4. **Persistence**: They maintained persistence using web shells and a custom malware framework that operates mostly in-memory. They also removed disk-resident tools after use to maintain stealth.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and other techniques for privilege escalation.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs. They also removed tools after use.

7. **Credential Access**: They modified login webpages to record credentials in plaintext.

8. **Discovery**: They used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory for reconnaissance, retrieved output files, and then deleted them.

9. **Command and Control**: They established C2 by hooking into IIS request handling processes using NodeIISWeb.

Now, the question is about whether TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the lateral movement phase.

Let's think about this:

- The outline mentions that they used SharpHound for reconnaissance, which is a tool used for Active Directory (AD) enumeration. This suggests that the target environment likely has an Active Directory infrastructure.

- AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) is a service that allows for federated identity management, often used for SSO (Single Sign-On) across different domains or organizations.

- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) tokens are used in AD FS for authentication and authorization between entities.

Given that TG1021 used SharpHound, which is used for AD reconnaissance, it's plausible that they might look for and exploit AD FS servers if present in the environment.

However, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention AD FS or SAML tokens. It's possible that AD FS is part of the environment, but we don't have direct evidence from the outline that TG1021 interacted with AD FS or abused SAML tokens.

Now, considering the lateral movement phase:

- Lateral movement typically involves moving from the initial entry point to other parts of the network to achieve the threat actor's objectives.

- Common techniques for lateral movement include using remote desktop protocols, exploiting vulnerabilities in other services, or using stolen credentials.

- Abusing AD FS and SAML tokens could be a method for lateral movement if the threat actor can obtain and use valid SAML tokens to access other resources within the network.

Given that TG1021 was active in an environment with AD (since they used SharpHound), and they collected credentials, it's possible that they could exploit AD FS if it's present.

But, the CTI outline doesn't provide specific information about AD FS or SAML tokens being abused.

Looking back at the question: "After TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory to perform reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase, is it likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase?"

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, while it's possible that TG1021 could abuse AD FS and SAML tokens for lateral movement, there's no direct evidence or indication in the outline that they did so.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the most accurate answer would be B: No, because there's no explicit mention or strong indication of AD FS or SAML token abuse in the CTI outline.

However, it's important to note that in a real-world scenario, if an environment has AD FS and SAML tokens, and the threat actor has access to credentials and is performing lateral movement, abusing SAML tokens could be a potential vector. But based solely on the information provided in the outline, there's no direct support for that conclusion.

**Final Answer: B**
