I've been given a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) outline about a threat actor called FIN13 and a question related to their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). My task is to analyze the CTI outline, understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and then determine the most plausible sequence of TTPs from the given answer choices in the question.

First, I need to thoroughly analyze the CTI outline. The outline provides a detailed description of FIN13's activities, starting from reconnaissance to exfiltration. It's important to note that FIN13 has been active since 2016, targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in financial, retail, and hospitality industries. Their main goal seems to be stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers.

Let's break down the CTI outline based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They conduct long-term intrusions, map victim networks, capture credentials, and steal sensitive documents.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. Specific vulnerabilities are not mentioned due to long dwell times and insufficient evidence.

3. **Execution**: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server to execute commands.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. They also use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: FIN13 uses common privilege escalation techniques, such as dumping LSASS process memory using ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion. They also use custom droppers like LATCHKEY and malware like DRAWSTRING with recon functionality.

7. **Credential Access**: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing. They target unsecured credentials and use trojanized KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

8. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive collected data using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

From the "Others" section, it's noted that FIN13 has a median dwell time of 913 days, which is much longer than typical financially motivated actors. They have operated for over five years, targeting only organizations in Mexico. Their endgame involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions. Notably, despite the rise of ransomware, FIN13 has not deployed ransomware and remains focused on traditional cybercrime.

Now, let's look at the question:

"After leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery, is it likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions?"

Answer Choices:

A: Yes

B: No

The question is asking whether, after performing internal reconnaissance, FIN13 is likely to use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network for lateral movement, followed by collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

To answer this, I need to evaluate FIN13's known TTPs and see if using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy aligns with their observed behavior.

First, from the CTI outline, FIN13 is known to use various methods for persistence and lateral movement, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions, deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and using email communications with a backdoor called MAILSLOT. They also use custom passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE and JSPRAT for execution and command and control.

Notably, FIN13 has been using custom malware and backdoors specifically designed for their operations. They have developed tools like BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK, JSPRAT, MAILSLOT, LATCHKEY, and DRAWSTRING, among others. This suggests that they have the capability and preference to use their own custom tools for various stages of their attack lifecycle.

Moreover, the outline mentions that FIN13 uses native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the question's statement about leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for discovery.

Now, regarding lateral movement, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy. However, FIN13 is known to use various methods for persistence and movement within the network, such as deploying malware and using backdoors.

PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool that system administrators use to deploy software and updates across a network. If FIN13 were to use such a tool, it would likely be part of their effort to move laterally within the network in a manner that blends with normal network traffic, thereby evading detection.

However, considering FIN13's preference for custom malware and backdoors, it seems less likely that they would rely on legitimate software deployment tools for lateral movement. Their use of custom tools suggests a higher degree of control and stealth, as custom tools can be tailored to avoid detection by security measures.

Furthermore, the question mentions moving "AvosLocker" across the network. AvosLocker is a ransomware variant, but the CTI outline specifically states that FIN13 has not deployed ransomware and remains focused on traditional cybercrime, such as fraudulent money transfers. Therefore, it's unlikely that FIN13 would be moving ransomware like AvosLocker across the network, as it doesn't align with their known objectives.

Given this information, the sequence of TTPs presented in the question seems inconsistent with FIN13's known behavior. They focus on credential theft, network reconnaissance, and data exfiltration for fraudulent transactions, rather than deploying ransomware.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

B: No

It is not likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement, as it doesn't align with their known TTPs and objectives.

**Final Answer: B**
