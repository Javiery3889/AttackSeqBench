Alright, I have this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about reconnaissance efforts by cybercriminals targeting medical networks. The report was written by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov on March 13, 2018. They describe how attackers use tools like masscan to find potential entry points into medical infrastructure. They look for IP ranges related to medical keywords and use search engines like Shodan and Censys to find public resources of these organizations.

During their reconnaissance, they found non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces that don't require authentication. These could be exploited for further reconnaissance.

Additionally, the "Others" section mentions that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017. There's also information about APT actors targeting pharmaceutical organizations with malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data, possibly for intellectual property or business plans. The report recommends removing medical data from public access, updating software, and not connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN to mitigate these threats.

Now, the question is: After conducting reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces, is it likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's think about this. The reconnaissance phase is the initial step where attackers gather information about their target. They use tools like masscan to find open ports and services, and search engines like Shodan and Censys to find public-facing resources.

In this case, they identified Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with unauthenticated web interfaces. These are specific types of services that might have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that attackers can exploit.

But the question is about whether metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings are likely to be retrieved during the discovery phase.

First, I need to understand what discovery phase entails. In the context of an attack, the discovery phase usually follows reconnaissance and involves gaining initial access to the target network and establishing a foothold.

During this phase, attackers might perform actions like:

1. Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

2. Enumerating the network to understand its structure.

3. Looking for sensitive information or valuable assets.

So, retrieving metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings would be activities that could occur during this phase, as attackers try to understand what data is available and where it's stored.

But, based on the CTI outline, the focus is on the reconnaissance phase, where attackers are identifying potential entry points, such as open ports and services, rather than actually accessing the systems to retrieve file metadata.

However, the question mentions "during the discovery phase," which seems to refer to the phase after reconnaissance where attackers have gained initial access and are exploring the network.

But there might be some overlap between reconnaissance and discovery. For example, some information can be gathered from public sources or by scanning services without actually compromising them.

In the case of the Building Management systems using Niagara Fox protocol and printers with unauthenticated web interfaces, it's possible that these services could be accessed to retrieve some information, perhaps even file listings or metadata, without fully compromising the system.

For instance, if a printer's web interface is unauthenticated, an attacker might be able to access logs or configuration files that contain metadata or file listings.

Similarly, the Niagara Fox protocol might allow for some information disclosure if not properly secured.

So, it's possible that during the reconnaissance phase, attackers could retrieve some metadata or file listings from these vulnerable services.

But the question specifies "during the discovery phase," which suggests that they have already gained some level of access beyond just scanning for open ports.

Given that, it's more likely that once attackers have gained initial access through one of these vulnerabilities, they would proceed to retrieve metadata and file listings as part of their efforts to understand the network and locate valuable data.

However, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly state whether metadata and file listings are retrieved during this phase.

I need to look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

To decide between these, I need to consider whether it's likely, based on the information provided, that metadata and file listings would be retrieved during the discovery phase.

Given that the discovery phase involves gaining access and exploring the network, it's reasonable to assume that attackers would seek to retrieve such information to advance their objectives.

Therefore, I would倾向于选择A: Yes.

But let me think about this again. The CTI outline doesn't provide specific details about what happens during the discovery phase; it mainly focuses on the reconnaissance efforts and the types of vulnerabilities found.

Without explicit information about what occurs after gaining access, I might be making an assumption based on general knowledge of attack phases rather than specifics from the outline.

However, the question is phrased based on the CTI outline, so it's expected that I use the information provided to make an informed decision.

Given that the outline mentions the identification of specific vulnerable services, and considering that these services could potentially be used to retrieve metadata and file listings, I think it's plausible that attackers would attempt to do so during the discovery phase.

Therefore, my answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{A} \]
