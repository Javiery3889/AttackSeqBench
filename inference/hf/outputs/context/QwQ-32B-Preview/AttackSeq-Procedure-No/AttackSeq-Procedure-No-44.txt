To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any information that suggests Machete divides files into smaller chunks before exfiltrating them, especially if the files are larger than 0x1000000 bytes (which is 16,777,216 bytes or 16 MB).

First, let's look at the part of the CTI outline that discusses the collection and exfiltration activities of Machete.

Under "Collection," it's mentioned that:

- Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs were encrypted.

Under "Command and Control," it's stated that:

- Machete used standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C&C) servers.

- It also implemented fallback channels, using HTTP to exfiltrate documents if FTP was unavailable.

- The malware could download additional files for execution on the victim's machine and used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.

Now, the question is about whether Machete divides files into smaller parts before exfiltrating them, specifically if the file size is 16 MB or larger.

Looking back at the CTI outline, there's no explicit mention of Machete splitting files into smaller chunks for exfiltration. However, it's important to consider that exfiltrating large files over network protocols like FTP or HTTP might be risky and could attract attention, especially if the network traffic is being monitored.

Some advanced malware does employ techniques to split large files into smaller parts to make exfiltration less conspicuous and to avoid raising alarms through large data transfers. But again, the CTI outline doesn't specify whether Machete does this.

Given that the outline doesn't provide any information about file division or splitting for exfiltration, and considering that the question is asking about a specific behavior (dividing files of 16 MB or more), I would have to conclude that there's no evidence to suggest that Machete engages in this practice based on the provided information.

Therefore, the answer should be "No," meaning that Machete is not likely to divide files before exfiltrating them, at least not based on the details provided in the CTI outline.

However, it's worth noting that this is an inference based on the absence of information rather than explicit evidence. In real-world scenarios, malware behaviors can be complex and may include various techniques not documented in every CTI report.

In conclusion, based on the provided CTI outline, the most appropriate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
