Alright, I've got this CTI outline about an attack by the Turla APT group, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions that the attack starts with initial access using a .NET/MSIL dropper that delivers the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. This dropper is disguised as an invitation to a G20 task force meeting and was observed in mid-July. The decoy document seems to be related to the G20 Digital Economy event, suggesting that the targets are likely G20 participants or those interested in the event.

Next, under Execution, it says that when the MSIL dropper is executed, it deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. This JavaScript dropper then installs a JS decryptor, which decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory. The dropper is named Runer.exe and it doesn't have any obfuscation or anti-analysis features. It writes Stage1 JS and the decoy PDF to the %APPDATA% folder for execution.

Under Defense Evasion, it notes that the KopiLuwak MSIL dropper lacks obfuscation or anti-analysis features, and the JavaScript dropper, Scr.js, fingerprints the system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion. The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites, and the HTTP User-Agent is now hardcoded, which is a change from previous variants.

In the Discovery section, Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file. These commands include checking for Kaspersky Lab directories and performing a traceroute to www.google.com.

Under Command and Control, the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites via HTTP POST requests and can receive various commands, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands.

Exfiltration is also mentioned as a capability of the updated KopiLuwak backdoor, which can exfiltrate files to the C&C and download files to the infected machine, with specific commands for these actions.

Lastly, under Others, it's noted that Proofpoint researchers haven't observed the attack in the wild but consider it potentially high impact for PCs running the .NET framework. The Turla APT group is believed to be Russian state-sponsored and has been involved in various cyber espionage activities. The researchers will continue monitoring the actor and the new tools.

Now, the question is: After Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and performs discovery tasks by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file, is it likely that Scr.js will install itself as a cron job before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to look back at the CTI outline and see what happens after Scr.js performs discovery tasks.

From the outline, under Execution, it mentions that the MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper (Scr.js), which then installs a JS decryptor to decrypt and execute the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.

Under Defense Evasion, it says that Scr.js sets up persistence without raising suspicion. However, it doesn't specify how it sets up persistence.

In the Discovery section, it mentions that Scr.js fingerprints the system by executing commands and saving output to a temporary file, including checking for Kaspersky Lab directories and performing a traceroute to Google.

So, after performing these discovery tasks, it's likely that Scr.js would set up persistence before executing the backdoor code.

Now, the question is whether it installs itself as a cron job.

Cron jobs are a way to schedule tasks on Unix-based systems. However, the dropper mentioned, Runer.exe, suggests that this is a Windows executable, as .exe files typically run on Windows.

Windows systems use Task Scheduler for similar purposes, not cron jobs. So, it's unlikely that Scr.js would install itself as a cron job on a Windows system.

Moreover, the question mentions "before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code."

This suggests that there's a task named PolicyConverter that executes appidpolicyconverter.js, which contains the backdoor code.

Given that, it's more plausible that Scr.js sets up persistence through Windows Task Scheduler or by creating a registry run key, rather than a cron job.

Therefore, the answer is likely B: No.

It's not likely that Scr.js will install itself as a cron job on a Windows system; instead, it would use Windows-specific methods for persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
