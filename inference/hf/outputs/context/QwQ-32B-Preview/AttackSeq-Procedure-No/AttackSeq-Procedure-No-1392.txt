Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on Mexico and specific industries, indicating they have a clear target selection process.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

3. **Execution**: Once inside, they use tools like JSPRAT for command execution, file operations, and proxying network traffic.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS memory with ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. Custom droppers and malware with recon functionality are also used.

7. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

8. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement, employing tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using various utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: "Is it likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance?"

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the sequence of tactics FIN13 might use. Specifically, whether they would retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before conducting internal network reconnaissance using native OS binaries.

Let's analyze this step by step.

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: This is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help users manage secrets securely. Secrets can include database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.

2. **Enum_secrets module**: This likely refers to a tool or script used to enumerate or list secrets stored in the AWS Secrets Manager.

3. **Reconnaissance using native OS binaries**: This refers to the phase where attackers gather information about the network and host configurations using built-in operating system tools.

So, the question is asking whether FIN13 would first retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before performing internal network reconnaissance using native OS tools.

To answer this, I need to consider the typical sequence of attack stages and see how they align with the activities described in the CTI outline.

First, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the standard sequence of tactics is:

1. Reconnaissance

2. Initial Access

3. Execution

4. Persistence

5. Privilege Escalation

6. Defense Evasion

7. Credential Access

8. Discovery (which includes reconnaissance)

9. Lateral Movement

10. Collection

11. Exfiltration

12. Impact

Now, in the CTI outline, the sequence is slightly different, but it covers similar ground:

1. Reconnaissance

2. Initial Access

3. Execution

4. Persistence

5. Privilege Escalation

6. Defense Evasion

7. Discovery

8. Lateral Movement

9. Collection

10. Command and Control

11. Exfiltration

So, generally, reconnaissance comes before other tactics like discovery and collection.

However, in this specific question, it's asking about the sequence between retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and gathering information using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

First, I need to see if FIN13 is known to use AWS services or target cloud environments. In the CTI outline, there's no explicit mention of AWS or cloud services. The targets are in Mexico, in finance, retail, and hospitality, but no specific reference to cloud usage.

But, considering that many organizations use cloud services, it's possible that some of FIN13's targets have AWS environments.

Now, the question is about whether FIN13 would retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before performing internal network reconnaissance using native OS binaries.

Let's think about the logical sequence:

- **Retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager** would likely happen after gaining initial access to a system that has access to AWS services, possibly after privilege escalation to gain credentials with AWS access.

- **Gathering information using native OS binaries** is part of the discovery phase, where attackers map the network and understand the environment they've infiltrated.

So, typically, discovery happens early in the attack lifecycle, often after initial access and before lateral movement or privilege escalation.

However, if FIN13 has gained access to a system with AWS credentials, they might exploit those credentials to access AWS services, including Secrets Manager, to retrieve additional credentials or sensitive information.

But, in terms of sequence:

- Discovery (using native OS binaries) is likely to happen early, to understand the environment.

- Accessing AWS Secrets Manager would require specific credentials and access, which might be obtained during privilege escalation or from specific systems.

So, it's possible that discovery comes before accessing AWS Secrets Manager, especially if accessing AWS services requires specific systems or credentials that are identified during the discovery phase.

Alternatively, if the initial access is through an external server with AWS credentials, they might access AWS services early on.

Given the information in the CTI outline, FIN13 uses web shells on external servers as a consistent entry point. If these external servers have access to AWS services, it's possible that accessing AWS Secrets Manager could happen relatively early in the attack chain.

However, the discovery phase, which includes mapping the network and understanding host configurations, is crucial for any lateral movement or further exploitation. So, even if they access AWS Secrets Manager early, they would still need to perform internal network discovery to understand where to go next.

Moreover, the CTI outline mentions that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and third-party tools for internal reconnaissance. This suggests that they perform a thorough discovery of the internal network to map resources and identify high-value targets.

Given this, it's likely that they would perform initial discovery using native OS binaries before delving into accessing AWS Secrets Manager, especially if accessing AWS services requires specific credentials that they might find during their discovery phase.

Additionally, accessing AWS Secrets Manager might be part of their credential access tactic, where they look for additional credentials to aid in their operations.

So, in terms of sequence:

1. Initial Access (via web shells on external servers)

2. Execution (using JSPRAT, etc.)

3. Discovery (using native OS binaries to map the network and understand the environment)

4. Privilege Escalation (to gain higher privileges, possibly accessing systems with AWS credentials)

5. Credential Access (accessing AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve additional secrets)

6. Lateral Movement (using WMI, etc., to move laterally across the network)

7. Collection (stealing sensitive data)

8. Exfiltration (transferring stolen data out)

Given this sequence, it's more likely that discovery using native OS binaries happens before accessing AWS Secrets Manager.

Therefore, the answer should be "No," it's not likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B**
