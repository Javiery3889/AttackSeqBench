To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of events during the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) heist carried out by the Lazarus group. The question specifically asks whether the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only after deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

First, let's break down the CTI outline to identify the sequence of attack stages and the tactics used by the Lazarus group.

**CTI Outline Analysis:**

1. **Execution:**
   - The attackers deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) which established persistence via a registry key.
   - The malware attempted to disable specific antivirus processes.
   - A 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file was used, which was decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
   - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), packed with Themida, was used to communicate with command and control servers and execute remote commands.

2. **Persistence:**
   - The loader/spreader malware was placed in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
   - A registry key was set for automatic execution.
   - The malware attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords related to FEIB.

3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The malware attempted to kill specific antivirus processes.
   - A 'Polyglot' file was used to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
   - Backdoor malware was packed with Themida to evade analysis and detection.

4. **Lateral Movement:**
   - The malware was copied to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
   - It iterated through a list of IP addresses to target active and responding devices.
   - Connections were established to SMB shares using provided credentials.

5. **Command and Control:**
   - Backdoor malware communicated with remote C&C servers.
   - It expected command line parameters specifying C&C address and port number.
   - It polled the C&C for tasks to execute and maintained a communication session to execute remote commands.

6. **Others:**
   - Background on the FEIB heist, including the use of the SWIFT network for unauthorized transfers.
   - Arrests in Sri Lanka related to cashing out transferred funds.
   - Recommendations for network hardening and monitoring.

From the outline, it's clear that the Lazarus group used various tactics, including execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. However, there is no explicit mention of deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

Given that, I need to infer whether the deployment of backdoor malware for C&C communication happened before or after the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

**Question Analysis:**

The question states: "After deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist, did the Lazarus group use backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only afterwards?"

Answer Choices:

A: Yes

B: No

The question implies that Hermes ransomware was deployed at some point during the heist to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, and it asks whether the use of backdoor malware for C&C communication occurred only after this action.

However, the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or the sequence in which it was used relative to other tactics.

**Evaluation:**

Given that the CTI outline doesn't provide explicit information about the deployment of Hermes ransomware and its sequence relative to other activities, I need to make an educated inference based on the typical sequence of events in a cyber attack.

Generally, in a ransomware attack, the sequence is as follows:

1. Initial compromise and execution of malware.

2. Establishment of persistence to maintain access.

3. Lateral movement to spread across the network.

4. Collection and exfiltration of data (in some cases).

5. Deployment of ransomware to encrypt files and delete shadow copies and backups.

6. Communication with C&C servers to receive further instructions or to report the success of the ransomware deployment.

Based on this general sequence, it's plausible that backdoor malware for C&C communication was used both before and after the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

In the CTI outline, it's mentioned that backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) was used to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands. This suggests that C&C communication was a持续 part of the attack, likely throughout the heist, including before and after the deployment of ransomware.

Therefore, it's unlikely that the use of backdoor malware for C&C communication was limited only to after the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

**Conclusion:**

Given the general sequence of events in a ransomware attack and the information provided in the CTI outline, it's more plausible that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands both before and after deploying Hermes ransomware.

Hence, the answer should be "No," meaning that they did not use backdoor malware for C&C communication only after deploying Hermes ransomware.

**Final Answer: B: No**
