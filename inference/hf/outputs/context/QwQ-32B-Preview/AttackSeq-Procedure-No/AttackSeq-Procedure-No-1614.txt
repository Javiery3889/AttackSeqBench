Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack and a question related to it. I need to figure out the correct answer based on the information provided in the outline. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions several MITRE ATT&CK tactics, so I'll list them out in order:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The attack is identified as a new Cosmic Banker attack, targeting Mexican banking institutions. It's linked to previous campaigns since March 2019 and has connections to Brazilian banking institutions and the Banload malware.

2. **Initial Access**: The attack starts with a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department, SAT. The email contains a zip file with malicious batch files and a legitimate-looking executable.

3. **Execution**: The batch files execute a PowerShell script that downloads a zip file (md.zip) containing the main malware library (12.dll), an executable loader from the AutoIt toolkit, and other services. The script also creates a folder in the public directory, extracts files, and renames them.

4. **Persistence**: The PowerShell script includes mechanisms for startup persistence, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

5. **Defense Evasion**: The main malware file is packed with VMProtect, making static analysis difficult.

6. **Credential Access**: The malware aims to steal bank credentials from Mexican financial institutions and also accesses Outlook to collect email accounts from the contacts list.

7. **Collection**: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

8. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.

Now, the question is: "After accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts, will the collected email accounts be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers?"

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to determine whether the collected email accounts are exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers based on the information in the CTI outline.

Looking back at the outline, under the "Collection" section, it says: "The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request."

So, the collected email accounts are sent through a POST web request, not over FTP.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a different method of transferring data, typically used for file transfers between computers on a network.

Given that the outline specifies that the data is sent via a POST web request, it doesn't align with exfiltration over FTP.

Therefore, the correct answer should be "No," because the data is sent via a POST web request, not over FTP.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

In the "Command and Control" section, it mentions that the PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data. It doesn't specify the protocol used for this communication, but earlier, in the "Collection" section, it clearly states that the data is sent through a POST web request.

POST is a HTTP method, which is different from FTP.

Hence, the exfiltration is happening via HTTP POST, not FTP.

So, the answer should be B: No.

I think that's the correct conclusion based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: B**
