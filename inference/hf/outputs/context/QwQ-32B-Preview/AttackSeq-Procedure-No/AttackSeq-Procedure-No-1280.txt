Alright, I have this CTI outline about an APT10 attack from 2019 in Southeast Asia. So, I need to analyze this and answer a question about their tactics based on the information provided.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- enSilo detected APT10 activity in April 2019 in Southeast Asia.

- They used DLL Side-Loading with jjs.exe to load a malicious jli.dll.

- This led to injecting shellcode into svchost.exe, which contained the malicious payload.

So, the initial access vector was exploiting DLL Side-Loading to get their malicious code executed on the target systems.

**Persistence:**

- First loader variant used a service for persistence, installing jjs.exe as a service with various names like WxUpdateServiceInfo, HxUpdateServiceInfo, etc.

- Second variant used the Run registry key for the current user under the name 'Windows Updata'.

This shows that APT10 employed different methods to maintain persistence on the compromised systems, depending on the variant of the loader they used.

**Defense Evasion:**

- The loader had a decryption and injection mechanism to evade detection.

- PlugX payload replaced executable headers' magic values with 'VX' to avoid being identified by security products.

- Memory allocation and release were wrapped with dummy calls to GetForegroundWindow to generate noise and evade detection.

This indicates that APT10 put effort into making their malware stealthy and harder to detect by security software.

**Command and Control:**

- C&C servers were located in South Korea.

- Domains used by the first loader variant resolved to IP addresses associated with 'DAOU TECHNOLOGY' in South Korea.

- PlugX domains also resolved to similar IP addresses, suggesting the same group operated both variants.

This suggests that APT10 used infrastructure in South Korea for their C&C communications.

**Others:**

- APT10 delivered different payloads like PlugX and Quasar RATs.

- Quasar RAT included SharpSploit for password extraction using mimikatz.

- Samples originated from the Philippines.

- Activity is consistent with APT10's history of targeting Southeast Asia.

- They used typosquatting domain names to pose as legitimate tech companies.

- The threat actor is still active, and this recent activity might be part of testing or a short-lived attack.

This provides additional context about APT10's operations, their tools, and their targeting preferences.

Now, the question is: "After using DLL Side-Loading with legitimate executables to load malicious DLLs during initial access, is it likely that APT10 will connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines before establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key?"

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

So, I need to determine based on the CTI outline whether it's likely that APT10 would connect to the IPC$ share on remote machines as part of their attack sequence.

First, let's understand what IPC$ share is. IPC$ (Inter-Process Communication share) is a special share in Windows that allows processes to communicate with each other over a network. It's often used by attackers to enumerate users, groups, and shares on a remote system without needing to provide credentials.

In the context of APT attacks, connecting to IPC$ share can be a reconnaissance step, allowing the attacker to gather information about the target network before proceeding with further exploitation.

Looking back at the CTI outline, there's no direct mention of APT10 connecting to IPC$ shares during their attack. The outline details the initial access method (DLL Side-Loading), persistence mechanisms (services and registry keys), defense evasion techniques, and C&C infrastructure.

However, the question is asking about the likelihood of APT10 connecting to IPC$ shares before establishing persistence. Given that IPC$ shares are often used for reconnaissance and lateral movement, it's possible that APT10 may use this technique as part of their broader attack campaign.

But based on the provided outline, there's no explicit evidence or indication that APT10 connected to IPC$ shares in this particular attack sequence. The focus is on the initial access and persistence methods used.

Moreover, the question specifies "before establishing persistence through services or the Run registry key." The CTI outline describes how APT10 established persistence using these methods but doesn't mention any steps taken prior to that, such as connecting to IPC$ shares.

Given the information provided, I don't have sufficient basis to confirm that APT10 connected to IPC$ shares as part of this attack sequence. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "No," it's not likely based on the given information.

However, it's worth noting that in general, APT groups like APT10 may use various techniques for reconnaissance and lateral movement, which could include connecting to IPC$ shares. But in this specific case, since there's no mention of it in the CTI outline, it's not supported by the provided data.

So, my final answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
