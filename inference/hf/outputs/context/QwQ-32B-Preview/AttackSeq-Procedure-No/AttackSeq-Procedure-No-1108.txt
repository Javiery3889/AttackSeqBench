To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics and techniques used by CosmicDuke, particularly focusing on the Collection and Exfiltration phases.

First, let's look at the Collection phase. According to the outline, CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. This suggests that during this phase, the malware is actively gathering sensitive data from the compromised system.

Next, the Exfiltration phase is about transferring the collected data out of the target's network to the attackers. The question is whether CosmicDuke uses the same channel for Exfiltration as it does for Command and Control (C2) communications.

From the CTI outline, under the Command and Control section, it's mentioned that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware. This indicates that there are different channels being used for C2 and data exfiltration.

Specifically, C2 communications use HTTP GET requests, while exfiltration employs FTP and WebDav servers. This suggests that CosmicDuke uses distinct protocols and channels for different purposes.

Therefore, based on this information, it's unlikely that CosmicDuke exfiltrates data over the same channel used for C2 during the Exfiltration phase.

So, the answer should be:

**Final Answer: B: No**
