Alright, I've got this CTI outline about an APT10 attack from 2019 in Southeast Asia. They used a technique called DLL Side-Loading to inject shellcode into svchost.exe. Then there's this question about whether APT10 is likely to use a specific Office Test persistence mechanism after injecting the shellcode.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence from the CTI outline. It starts with Initial Access using DLL Side-Loading, where they abuse jjs.exe to load a malicious jli.dll instead of the legitimate one it depends on. This malicious DLL then decrypts a data file, svchost.bin, and injects the shellcode into svchost.exe. So, the execution phase involves creating a process, allocating memory, writing the shellcode, and executing it remotely.

Next, the Defense Evasion part mentions that the loader has a decryption and injection mechanism to avoid detection. They also modify the executable headers to prevent security products from identifying them. Additionally, they use dummy API calls to create noise and evade detection.

Then, the Command and Control section says that APT10 used C&C servers in South Korea, with domains registered in Hong Kong. The domains resolved to IP addresses associated with 'DAOU TECHNOLOGY' in South Korea, and these domains were linked to previous APT10 activities.

In the 'Others' section, it's mentioned that APT10 delivers different payloads like PlugX and Quasar RATs. The Quasar RAT includes SharpSploit for extracting passwords using Mimikatz. The samples were from the Philippines, and APT10 has a history of targeting Southeast Asia. They use typosquatting domain names to pose as legitimate tech companies and have unique malware families. The group is still active, and this recent activity might be part of testing or a short-lived attack.

Now, the question is: After injecting decrypted shellcode into svchost.exe using DLL Side-Loading for execution, is APT10 likely to use the Office Test persistence mechanism within Microsoft Office by adding the Registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf to ensure persistence?

The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions anything about persistence mechanisms, especially one related to Microsoft Office registry keys.

Looking back at the outline, under Initial Access, it describes how they used DLL Side-Loading to gain execution. In the Execution phase, it details how the malicious DLL injects shellcode into svchost.exe. The Defense Evasion section talks about techniques to avoid detection, but nothing specific about persistence.

The Command and Control section discusses the infrastructure they used, but again, no mention of persistence mechanisms.

In the 'Others' section, it mentions that APT10 delivers different payloads like PlugX and Quasar RATs. Quasar RAT has SharpSploit for extracting passwords using Mimikatz, but still, no specific mention of persistence mechanisms.

So, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there's no direct indication that APT10 used the Office Test persistence mechanism with the registry key mentioned.

However, I need to consider if this kind of persistence is typical for APT10 or if there's any indirect evidence in the outline that suggests they would use such a method.

From the outline, APT10 has been using various payloads like PlugX and Quasar RATs. These are known malware families that typically include persistence mechanisms. But the specific method mentioned in the question—using a registry key for Office Test persistence—is not something that's been detailed in the outline.

Moreover, the attack sequence described focuses on DLL Side-Loading to inject shellcode into svchost.exe, which is a different approach from using Office for persistence.

Given that, it seems unlikely that APT10 would use the Office Test persistence mechanism in this particular attack, based on the information provided.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there's any reason to think otherwise.

Is there any indication that APT10 uses Microsoft Office for persistence in general? The outline mentions that they use typosquatting domain names to pose as legitimate tech companies, which might suggest they sometimes target Office users, but that doesn't directly relate to using Office for persistence.

Also, the Quasar RAT includes SharpSploit for password extraction, which is a .NET-based tool, but again, not directly related to the Office Test persistence mechanism.

Furthermore, the attack vector here is DLL Side-Loading through jjs.exe, which is related to JavaScript engines in Java, not directly to Office.

Therefore, without any specific evidence or indication in the CTI outline that APT10 uses the Office Test persistence mechanism in this attack, it's reasonable to conclude that they are not likely to use it in this scenario.

So, the final answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
