Alright, I have this CTI outline about Operation Sharpshooter, which seems to be a cyber attack campaign. I need to answer a question based on this outline, specifically about the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack. The question is: "After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication?" And I have two answer choices: A: Yes, and B: No.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. The outline is structured around MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which include Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Discovery, and Exfiltration. Let's go through each part step by step.

Starting with Reconnaissance: The McAfee team found that Operation Sharpshooter posed as legitimate job recruitment activity to gather information for potential exploitation. This suggests that the threat actors were gathering intelligence on their targets, possibly to identify vulnerabilities or to craft more convincing phishing messages.

Next, Initial Access: The campaign began on October 25 with malicious documents containing a Korean-language metadata and English job descriptions, targeting defense and government organizations. These documents had a malicious macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word, which then retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.

Then, Execution: The shellcode from the macro in winword.exe acted as a downloader for Rising Sun. It used functions like LoadLibraryA() and GetProcAddress() to resolve libraries and APIs, downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document to specific folders, and executed them using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process, so it doesn't need to set up persistence mechanisms itself.

Discovery: After gaining access, the implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information, such as network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP addresses, system information, and OS product name from the registry. It also decrypted additional information, though not all of it was used by the implant.

Exfiltration: The implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before sending it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

In the "Others" section, it's mentioned that this implant framework uses code from an older backdoor called Duuzer, which was previously used to target South Korea and Japan. There are similarities to Lazarus Group attacks, but there are also possibilities of false flags. The campaign targeted nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies globally, mainly in the United States. The implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, and file operations. Attribution to the Lazarus Group is suggested but not confirmed due to potential false flags.

Now, looking at the question: "After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication?"

So, I need to determine if, after the discovery phase, the implant likely used blogs and WordPress for command and control (C2) communication.

First, let's recall from the outline how the implant communicated with the C2 server. In the Exfiltration section, it mentions that the implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it via HTTP POST requests. However, it doesn't specify the communication channel or the type of server it communicated with.

But earlier, in the Initial Access section, it mentions that the malicious documents were distributed via an IP address in the United States and through Dropbox. So, Dropbox was used as a distribution vector, but not necessarily for C2 communication.

In the Execution section, it talks about how the shellcode downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document to specific folders and executed them using certain API functions, but again, no mention of C2 communication method.

The Exfiltration section only mentions HTTP POST requests to a control server, but it doesn't specify whether this control server is a blog or a WordPress site.

So, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there's no direct indication that blogs or WordPress sites were used for C2 communication.

However, it's common in some cyber operations for threat actors to use legitimate platforms like blogs or WordPress sites to host C2 servers, as these platforms are widespread and can blend in with normal traffic, making detection harder.

But in this specific case, the outline doesn't provide any evidence or hints suggesting that blogs or WordPress were used for C2.

Therefore, based on the given information, it's not likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

So, the answer should be B: No.

But let's consider if there's any indirect evidence or context that might suggest otherwise.

The "Others" section mentions that the implant framework uses code from Duuzer, which was last seen targeting South Korea and Japan. It also notes similarities to Lazarus Group attacks but raises the possibility of false flags.

Lazarus Group is known for using various C2 channels, including those hosted on legitimate platforms to avoid detection. So, perhaps, given the association with Lazarus Group, it's possible that they might use blogs or WordPress for C2.

However, this is speculative and not directly supported by the information in the outline.

Moreover, the outline specifies that the implant communicated via HTTP POST requests to a control server, but it doesn't specify the nature of that server.

Given that, I should stick to the information provided and not make assumptions based on general knowledge about threat groups.

Since there's no direct or indirect evidence in the outline suggesting that blogs or WordPress were used for C2, the most accurate answer is B: No.

It's important not to introduce external information or assumptions when making judgments based on a specific report.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
