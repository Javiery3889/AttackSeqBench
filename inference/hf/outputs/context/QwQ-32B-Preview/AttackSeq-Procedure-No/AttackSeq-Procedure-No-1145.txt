Alright, I've got this CTI outline to analyze, and a question about whether cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys after discovering certain vulnerabilities in medical networks. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about discovery of various services on medical network perimeters, like outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces. Also, there are medical devices such as spirometers or blood pressure monitors that support MQTT protocol and are discoverable online. This suggests that these devices might not have proper security measures, making them potential targets for unauthorized access.

The "Others" section provides some context: over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017, and there are APT actors targeting pharmaceutical organizations with malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data. The recommendation is to remove medical data nodes from public access, update software, and avoid connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

Now, the question is: after uncovering these vulnerabilities, is it likely that cybercriminals would then use Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations?

Shodan and Censys are search engines that allow users to find specific types of devices or services connected to the internet. They're particularly useful for finding internet-connected devices, including those that might be vulnerable or misconfigured.

Given that the CTI outline mentions that these medical devices and systems are discoverable online, it's reasonable to assume that cybercriminals could use tools like Shodan and Censys to find them. These search engines can help identify specific types of devices, versions of software, and even open ports, which are all valuable information for an attacker looking to exploit known vulnerabilities.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the information provided.

On one hand, the outline highlights that these devices and systems are discoverable online, which implies that they are exposed to the internet and could be found using search engines like Shodan and Censys.

On the other hand, the outline doesn't explicitly state that Shodan and Censys were used in the attacks mentioned. However, it's a common practice for attackers to use these tools to find potential targets with known vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the outline mentions that medical devices supporting MQTT are discoverable online, which suggests that they have internet accessibility, making them potential targets for such searches.

Given this information, it seems likely that cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to discover these publicly available resources.

Therefore, the answer should be:

Final Answer: A
