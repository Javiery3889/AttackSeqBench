To answer this question, I need to analyze the CTI outline provided and see how it relates to the question about identifying entry points into medical infrastructure using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance.

First, let's look at the CTI outline:

**Reconnaissance:**

- The report by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov details cybercriminals' reconnaissance efforts targeting medical networks.

- They used masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.

- Specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys were used to find publicly available resources of these organizations.

- They discovered non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication, which could be exploited for further reconnaissance.

**Others:**

- Over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017.

- APT actors targeted pharmaceutical organizations using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.

- Recommendations include removing medical data nodes from public access, updating software, and avoiding connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

Now, the question is: "After discovering various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, as part of network service discovery, is it likely that entry points into medical infrastructure will be identified using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance?"

The answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine whether using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance is likely to identify entry points into medical infrastructure, given the information in the CTI outline.

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Tools:**

   - **Masscan:** A fast port scanner that can scan the entire internet in under 5 minutes. It's used to identify open ports and services on target networks.

   - **Shodan and Censys:** These are search engines that index internet-connected devices and services. They can be used to find specific types of devices or services based on various criteria.

2. **Reconnaissance Activities:**

   - The CTI outline mentions that cybercriminals used masscan to extract IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords and then used Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations.

   - They discovered non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

3. **Identification of Entry Points:**

   - The discovery of these services and ports suggests that there are potential entry points into the medical infrastructure.

   - Outdated systems and medical devices are likely to have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

4. **Likelihood of Identifying Entry Points:**

   - Given that the cybercriminals used these tools and discovered exploitable services, it is likely that these tools can identify entry points.

   - The CTI outline provides examples of specific vulnerabilities found, such as unprotected web interfaces and outdated protocols.

5. **Context from the 'Others' Section:**

   - The high percentage of medical organizations with malware indicates that these infrastructures are vulnerable.

   - APT actors targeting these organizations further suggests that there are identifiable entry points.

   - The recommendations to remove medical data nodes from public access and update software imply that current practices are insufficient in protecting against such reconnaissance efforts.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that entry points into medical infrastructure will be identified using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
