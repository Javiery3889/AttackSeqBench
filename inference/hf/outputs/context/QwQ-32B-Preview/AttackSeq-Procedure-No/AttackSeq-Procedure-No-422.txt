To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the campaign. The question is asking whether it's likely that the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The campaign involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. These emails are designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

2. **Execution**: Opening the malicious Word document executes a VBS macro that calls a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script then downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.

3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.

4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads. It first attempts to use the DownloadString method and then the DownloadData method to download resources from C2 servers.

5. **Impact**: The payloads are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware. GandCrab encrypts files, while Ursnif performs credential harvesting, gathers system and process information, and may deploy additional malware.

6. **Others**: The campaign was analyzed using VirusTotal Graph, which organized variants into groups based on metadata or document structures. At least three different variants of Ursnif were hosted on bevendbrec[.]com, along with PowerShell cradles and PS Empire scripts used to inject the GandCrab sample into memory. Carbon Black's Threat Analysis Unit released this report to help researchers and security practitioners combat the campaign, as new samples were being discovered daily.

Now, let's look at the question:

"Is it likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to determine if there's any indication in the CTI outline that suggests the campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after the initial access phase.

First, I need to understand what CVE-2018-13379 is. A quick search reveals that CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS devices, specifically in the SSL VPN portal, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Given that, I need to see if there's any mention or implication in the CTI outline that the campaign targets FortiOS devices or plans to exploit this specific vulnerability after gaining initial access via phishing emails.

Looking back at the outline:

- The initial access vector is phishing emails with malicious Word documents.

- The payloads delivered are Ursnif and GandCrab.

- The campaign uses various techniques to execute scripts, download payloads, and communicate with C2 servers.

- There's no mention of targeting network devices or exploiting vulnerabilities in specific types of devices like FortiOS.

- The impact is described in terms of ransomware and information theft, but nothing about compromising network infrastructure.

Given this information, there's no direct or indirect indication that the campaign plans to exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after initial access.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, it's unlikely that the campaign will exploit this specific vulnerability.

So, the answer should be:

B: No

**Final Answer: B**
