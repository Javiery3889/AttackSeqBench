Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the GreyEnergy group and a question regarding their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It describes how the GreyEnergy group typically gains initial access to a network. They use two main methods: exploiting public-facing web services and sending spearphishing emails with malicious attachments that drop a lightweight backdoor called "GreyEnergy mini." Once they have a foothold, they use tools like Nmap for network mapping and Mimikatz for credential harvesting to escalate their privileges and gain control over the entire network.

Now, the question is asking whether, after these initial steps, the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network. I need to evaluate the answer choices: A) Yes or B) No.

To answer this, I need to consider the information provided in the CTI outline and see if it supports the use of PDQ Deploy by the GreyEnergy group for lateral movement.

Let's recall what PDQ Deploy is. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software tool used for deploying software and managing installations across multiple computers in a network. It's a legitimate administrative tool, but like any such tool, it can be abused by attackers for malicious purposes, such as deploying ransomware or other malware across a network.

Given that the GreyEnergy group has already gained domain administrator privileges, they would have the ability to use such administrative tools. However, the CTI outline doesn't specifically mention PDQ Deploy. It only mentions Nmap and Mimikatz, which are tools used for reconnaissance and credential dumping, respectively.

So, the question is about a subsequent step in their attack chain: lateral movement and deployment of malware (specifically AvosLocker). The outline doesn't provide details about how they move laterally beyond using Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.

Given that, I need to consider whether it's plausible that they would use PDQ Deploy for this purpose. On one hand, PDQ Deploy is a powerful tool that can efficiently deploy software across a network, which would be useful for rapidly spreading ransomware like AvosLocker. On the other hand, using such a legitimate tool might raise red flags or be easily detectable, especially if it's not normally used in the target environment.

Moreover, the GreyEnergy group might prefer to use more stealthy methods for lateral movement, such as using built-in Windows tools like PowerShell, PsExec, or WMI, which are less likely to be detected by security systems.

The CTI outline mentions that they use "fairly standard tools," and while PDQ Deploy might be considered standard in some administrative contexts, it's not as universally present or well-known as the tools like Nmap and Mimikatz that are already mentioned.

Additionally, the outline doesn't provide any specific indication that PDQ Deploy is part of their toolkit. So, based on the information given, I don't have concrete evidence to support the use of PDQ Deploy by the GreyEnergy group for lateral movement.

Therefore, in the absence of specific information linking the GreyEnergy group to PDQ Deploy, and considering that there are more common and stealthy methods for lateral movement, I would lean towards answer choice B) No.

However, it's important to note that threat actors can evolve their tactics and may use a variety of tools depending on the target. But based solely on the provided CTI outline, there's no direct support for the use of PDQ Deploy in this context.

So, my final answer is:

Final Answer: B
