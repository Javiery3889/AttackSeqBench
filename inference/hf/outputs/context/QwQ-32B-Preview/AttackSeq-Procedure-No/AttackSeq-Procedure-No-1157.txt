Alright, I have this CTI outline here about a cyber attack targeting Instagram users, mainly influencers. It's reported by Jindrich Karasek from Trend Micro on July 12, 2021. The attack involves initial access through phishing techniques where the attackers impersonate technical support or friends of the victims. They use various communication channels like phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or direct Instagram messages. These messages typically have generic greetings and lure victims with claims of copyright violations or offers of verified badges to trick them into visiting phishing sites that look like Instagram's login page.

So, the question is asking about the sequence of tactics used by these attackers after the initial impersonation and delivery of phishing messages. Specifically, it's asking if it's likely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.

Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events as described in the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access**: Attackers impersonate technical support or friends.

2. **Delivery**: They send phishing messages via email, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram, claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges.

3. **Phishing**: These messages direct victims to phishing sites that mimic Instagram's login page to harvest credentials.

4. **Impact**: After compromising the accounts, attackers demand ransom payments for the return of the accounts. Some victims pay but don't get their accounts back; instead, attackers continue to demand more payment. They also use the compromised accounts to perpetuate scams and sell their hacking expertise in underground markets.

Now, the question is asking if, after impersonating and sending phishing messages, the attackers are likely to lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the CTI outline.

First, consider the sequence:

- Attackers impersonate and send phishing messages.

- Victims click on these messages and are directed to phishing sites.

- On these sites, they enter their Instagram credentials, which are then harvested by the attackers.

Now, the question is whether, as part of this process, the attackers change the account passwords to lock out the original owners before using the phishing sites.

Hmm.

Let's think about this.

If the attackers change the account passwords immediately after gaining access, that would prevent the original owners from logging in. But, if they do this before using the phishing sites, there's a problem.

Because, if they've already changed the passwords, the phishing sites wouldn't be necessary anymore, right? They've already gained access and locked out the owners.

Wait, but according to the CTI outline, the phishing sites are used to collect credentials from victims. So, the changing of passwords would likely happen after they have the credentials, not before.

Moreover, the impact section mentions that attackers demand ransom payments for the return of the accounts, suggesting that they have control over the accounts, presumably by having changed the passwords or otherwise locked out the original owners.

So, the sequence likely is:

1. Impersonate and send phishing messages.

2. Victims fall for the phishing and enter their credentials on the fake login pages.

3. Attackers collect these credentials.

4. Using these credentials, attackers log into the Instagram accounts.

5. Once inside, they change the account passwords to lock out the original owners.

6. Then, they can use the accounts for their purposes, such as demanding ransom or conducting further scams.

Therefore, changing the account passwords is a step that occurs after they have gained access through the phishing campaign, not before.

So, the statement in the question suggests that attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials. But based on the CTI outline, it seems more logical that they collect the credentials first through phishing, use those credentials to access the accounts, and then change the passwords to lock out the owners.

Hence, the sequence described in the question appears to be reversed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be "No," meaning it's not likely that attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials.

Wait, but let's think about another perspective. Maybe in some cases, attackers do change passwords immediately to lock out owners, and then continue to use the account. But according to the CTI outline, the main method is phishing to collect credentials, suggesting that password changing happens after gaining access.

Moreover, if attackers change passwords before setting up phishing sites, how would the phishing sites be used to collect credentials? The accounts would already be compromised, and the phishing sites might not be necessary anymore.

Unless... unless the attackers want to collect new credentials to access other accounts or something. But that doesn't make much sense in this context.

Alternatively, maybe the attackers use the phishing sites to collect credentials and simultaneously change passwords to lock out the owners. But even then, the sequence would be: phishing to get credentials, then using those credentials to change passwords.

So, still, changing passwords comes after phishing.

Therefore, the statement in the question seems incorrect in suggesting that password changing happens before using phishing sites.

Hence, the answer should be "No."

I think answer choice B is the correct one.

**Final Answer: B**
