Alright, I have this CTI outline from ESET about a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant called Hodur. The outline provides a lot of details about the attack, including the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used. My task is to answer a specific question based on this outline, and I have to choose between "Yes" and "No."

First, I need to understand the question: "After establishing persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under %allusersprofile% and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry, is the Korplug variant likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol?"

So, breaking it down:

1. The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory under %allusersprofile% and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.

2. Then, it's likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections.

3. Finally, it exfiltrates data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

I need to determine if steps 2 and 3 are likely based on the CTI outline.

Let's look at the outline to find relevant information.

Under "Persistence:"

- Korplug creates a directory under %allusersprofile%, marks it as hidden and system, copies necessary files there, and sets up persistence via a scheduled task or registry entry.

This matches the first part of the question.

Now, for the second part: remotely discovering systems over LAN connections.

Looking through the outline, under "Collection:"

- Korplug collects data from local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

- It can list files and directories along with their attributes and content.

- Collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.

This suggests that Korplug can indeed discover systems over LAN connections, especially since it can access network shared drives and mapped drives.

Additionally, under "Command and Control:"

- Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

- It can download additional files from the C&C server.

But the question is about discovering systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data.

So, it seems that Korplug has the capability to discover systems over LAN and collect data from them.

Now, for exfiltration:

- Under "Exfiltration:"

- Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom TCP-based protocol used for commands.

- Involves TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.

So, the exfiltration method is via custom TCP protocol, which aligns with the question.

Given this information, it seems likely that after establishing persistence, Korplug would remotely discover systems over LAN connections to collect data, and then exfiltrate that data via the custom TCP-based protocol.

But I need to make sure there's no information in the outline that contradicts this.

Looking back, under "Initial Access:"

- Phishing and watering hole attacks are believed to be the initial access vectors.

- Uses filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.

Under "Execution:"

- Custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.

- The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability.

Under "Defense Evasion:"

- Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.

- Encrypted Korplug file decrypted in memory and made executable.

Under "Others:"

- Campaign uses current events to lure victims.

- Group iteratively improves its tools.

- ESET offers intelligence reports.

Nothing in these sections contradicts the idea that Korplug would discover and collect data from LAN systems before exfiltration.

In fact, the "Collection" section explicitly mentions collecting data from network shared drives, which implies LAN discovery and access.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that the Korplug variant would remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data via the custom TCP-based protocol.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

But let's consider if there's any reason to choose "No."

If the outline stated that Korplug only collects data from the local system and does not access network resources, then "No" would be appropriate.

However, since it specifically mentions collecting data from network shared drives and mapped drives, "Yes" is the more accurate answer.

Hence, the final answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
