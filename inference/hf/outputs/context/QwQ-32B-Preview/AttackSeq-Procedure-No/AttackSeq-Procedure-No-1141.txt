Alright, I have this CTI outline and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's about reconnaissance efforts by cybercriminals targeting medical networks. The report was written by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov in March 2018. They talk about using a tool called masscan to find potential entry points into medical infrastructure. They look for IP ranges related to medical keywords and use search engines like Shodan and Censys to find public resources of these organizations.

So, reconnaissance is the initial step where attackers try to gather information about their target. In this case, they're targeting medical networks. They're using tools to scan for open ports and services that might be vulnerable.

The report mentions discovering non-trivial ports and services, like Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces that don't require authentication. These could be exploited for further reconnaissance or even for gaining access to the network.

Additionally, the "Others" section provides some context. It says that over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017. There's also mention of APT actors targeting pharmaceutical organizations using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data, possibly for intellectual property or business plans.

The authors recommend removing medical data nodes from public access, updating software, and not connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN to mitigate these threats.

Now, the question is: "After identifying outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online, is it likely that reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces will be conducted during the discovery phase?"

And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide whether, after finding outdated medical devices with MQTT protocol that are discoverable online, it's likely that attackers will conduct reconnaissance using tools like masscan and look for things like Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces during the discovery phase.

Let's think about this.

First, the CTI outline describes reconnaissance activities that include using masscan to identify potential entry points, searching for IP ranges related to medical keywords, and using Shodan and Censys to find public resources.

They specifically mention finding non-trivial ports and services, like Building Management systems using Niagara Fox and printers with unauthenticated web interfaces.

So, in the context of this report, reconnaissance involves scanning for vulnerable services and identifying potential entry points into the medical network.

Now, the question is asking whether, after identifying outdated medical devices supporting MQTT and being discoverable online, such reconnaissance activities are likely during the discovery phase.

Well, discovery phase is part of the reconnaissance where attackers identify and gather information about potential targets.

Given that the CTI outline already describes reconnaissance activities involving scanning and identifying various vulnerable services, it seems plausible that identifying outdated medical devices with MQTT would be part of that same reconnaissance process.

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT devices, including medical devices. If these devices are discoverable online and are outdated, they could be vulnerable to exploitation.

So, if attackers are already using tools like masscan to find potential entry points, it makes sense that they would also look for outdated medical devices with MQTT enabled, especially since these devices could provide another vector for gaining access to the network.

Furthermore, the CTI outline mentions that Building Management systems and printers with unauthenticated web interfaces are also being looked at as potential entry points.

So, in the discovery phase, attackers are trying to map out the network, identify all accessible services, and find any weaknesses that can be exploited.

Therefore, it's likely that if they're already using masscan and other tools to find various services, they would also look for outdated medical devices with MQTT enabled.

Hence, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let's consider if there's any reason to choose B: No.

Well, maybe if the question suggested that the identification of outdated medical devices with MQTT was a separate activity not related to the reconnaissance described in the report.

But in this case, the CTI outline clearly describes broad reconnaissance activities aimed at identifying various vulnerabilities in medical networks.

Given that, it's reasonable to assume that identifying outdated medical devices with MQTT would be part of that same reconnaissance effort.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
