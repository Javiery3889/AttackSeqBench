Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Longhorn group and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about the Longhorn group, which has been active since 2011, using back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to attack targets. There's a specific instance where a computer in the US was compromised but the malware was uninstalled within hours, probably by accident. Symantec first noticed their activities in 2014 when a zero-day exploit was used in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

So, the initial access tactic is using a zero-day exploit in a Word document to deploy Plexor malware. That makes sense.

Next, under Discovery, it says that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. They also use operational security measures to stay hidden.

Then, under Collection, it mentions that the malware has many commands for remote control and can be customized with plugins and modules. It's designed for espionage, with capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

Command and Control talks about how Longhorn sets up specific domain and IP combinations for each target's C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their identity. The IP addresses are usually from legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting. The malware communicates over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.

Exfiltration mentions that the malware communicates externally at specific times, with limits on the amount of data exfiltrated and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

In the Others section, it says Symantec has been protecting against Longhorn for three years and has tracked them. Longhorn has targeted governments and international organizations, with evidence of activities against 40 targets in 16 countries. They use preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses. The group operates with high operational security and seems to operate during standard business hours, possibly from an English-speaking, North American country.

Now, the question is: After using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware, is it likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection?

And the answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's think about this. The outline clearly states that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. It also mentions that they use operational security measures to remain undetected.

So, after gaining initial access through a zero-day exploit in a Word document and deploying Plexor malware, it's logical to assume that the malware would then perform system fingerprinting and discovery to understand the target environment better. This is a common tactic in espionage-related cyber attacks. The malware needs to know what it's dealing with to effectively carry out its objectives without being detected.

Furthermore, the outline mentions that the malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules. This suggests that once the initial access is gained, the malware can be tailored to the specific target, which would require some level of discovery and fingerprinting.

Also, the fact that the malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals indicates that they are taking steps to avoid detection, which aligns with the idea of following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

So, putting it all together, it seems very likely that after infecting a target with Plexor malware, Longhorn's tools would perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities before proceeding with other activities while adhering to their operational security measures.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But let's consider if there might be any reason to choose B: No.

Well, maybe if the malware was designed to be as stealthy as possible, it might avoid performing extensive system fingerprinting that could raise alarms. However, the outline specifically mentions that the malware has system fingerprinting capabilities, and for espionage purposes, having information about the target system is crucial.

Another thought: perhaps in some cases, the malware is designed to lie low and not perform any actions until remotely commanded to do so. But again, even in that scenario, some level of discovery might be necessary to report back to the operators about the compromised system.

Moreover, the fact that the malware has an uninstaller that was launched within hours in one instance suggests that sometimes the infection might be short-lived, possibly because it was detected or because it was a test. But in general, their operations are designed to persist and remain undetected for espionage purposes.

So, overall, it makes more sense to go with A: Yes.

Final Answer: A
