Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the Smooth Operator malware and a question to answer based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline, ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. So, looking at the outline:

1. **Initial Access**: The malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software. Infected software packages are signed and notarized, making them seem legitimate. The malicious code is in a dylib that downloads and executes a second-stage payload.

2. **Execution**: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software, creating a new thread and using a constructor function in the dylib to start without affecting normal library usage.

3. **Persistence**: It persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software, ensuring it runs every time a specific library is loaded.

4. **Defense Evasion**: Several techniques are used here, including daemonizing the second-stage payload, deleting itself after execution, writing to legitimate directories to look normal, and obfuscating C2 traffic.

5. **Discovery**: The malware collects information like OS version from SystemVersion.plist and domain and account names from 3CX's config.json.

6. **Command and Control**: Communications are over HTTPS with custom data encoding, multiple C2 servers, and random selection for each beacon.

7. **Exfiltration**: Data is exfiltrated over HTTPS, not through the C2 channel, specifically victim-specific data from the 3CX installation and a victim ID.

Now, the question is: After collecting the OS version from SystemVersion.plist during discovery, is Smooth Operator likely to perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json during its collection stage?

So, I need to figure out the sequence of actions here. Let's look at the discovery phase:

- It collects OS version from SystemVersion.plist.

- It also collects domain and account name values from 3CX's config.json.

Then, for command and control:

- It communicates over HTTPS with obfuscated data.

- It has multiple C2 servers and chooses one randomly for each beacon.

And for exfiltration:

- It exfiltrates collected data over HTTPS, separate from the C2 channel.

So, the question is about the timing: does it communicate with C2 via HTTPS before parsing config.json, after getting the OS version?

Let's think about this. The discovery phase seems to be about gathering information about the victim machine. It collects OS version and other config data. Then, it presumably sends this information back to the C2 server.

But the exfiltration is mentioned separately, and it's said to be over HTTPS, not over the existing C2 channel. That's interesting. So, maybe there are two different communication channels: one for C2 and another for exfiltration.

Looking back, in the command and control section, it says it communicates over HTTPS with custom encoding, and it has multiple C2 servers. In exfiltration, it exfiltrates victim-specific data over HTTPS via HTTP GET requests.

So, perhaps the discovery data is sent back via the C2 channel, and then exfiltration happens separately.

But the question is specifically about whether it performs HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers before parsing config.json.

Wait, the sequence is:

- Collect OS version from SystemVersion.plist.

- Then, presumably, parse config.json to get domain and account names.

The question is, does it communicate with C2 via HTTPS before parsing config.json.

But according to the outline, discovery includes both collecting OS version and parsing config.json. So, it's not clear if these actions are sequential or parallel.

However, in real-world malware behavior, it's common to collect as much information as possible before communicating back to C2 to establish a profile of the compromised system.

Given that, it's likely that the malware collects all discovery data first—both OS version and config.json data—before communicating back to C2.

But the question is specifically about whether it communicates with C2 via HTTPS before parsing config.json.

Given the information provided, I don't see any indication that it communicates with C2 in between collecting OS version and parsing config.json.

Therefore, my initial thought is that it collects both pieces of information first and then communicates with C2.

But let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

If I choose A: Yes, that means it performs HTTPS-based communication with C2 before parsing config.json.

But based on the outline, it seems that discovery includes both collecting OS version and parsing config.json, and then it communicates back via C2.

So, in that case, it would be after both collection activities.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps it communicates back after each collection activity.

The outline doesn't specify the sequence within the discovery phase.

Given that, it's possible that after collecting the OS version, it communicates back to C2, and then proceeds to parse config.json.

But again, the exfiltration is mentioned separately, which might suggest that discovery data is sent via the C2 channel, and exfiltration is a different process.

But the question is specifically about whether it performs HTTPS communication before parsing config.json.

Given that the discovery phase includes both collecting OS version and parsing config.json, and there's no indication that it communicates back to C2 in between these activities, I think the most plausible sequence is that it collects all discovery data first and then communicates back via C2.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No.

It does not perform HTTPS-based communication with C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from config.json.

Hence, the final answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
