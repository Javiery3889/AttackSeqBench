To answer this question, I need to analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the malware in Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on the iOS malware named XAgent.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access**: The outline mentions that the iOS malware is part of Operation Pawn Storm and is likely installed on already compromised systems. It's similar to other SEDNIT malware found for Windows systems. This suggests that the initial access vector might be through another compromise, and the iOS malware is a secondary installation.

2. **Execution**: The XAgent app is fully functional malware that hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7 devices. It can restart automatically if terminated. On iOS 8 devices, it doesn't hide its icon and can't restart automatically, indicating that it was designed before iOS 8 was released.

3. **Discovery**: The malware is designed to collect various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, installed apps, running processes, and Wi-Fi status.

Now, the question is asking about the likelihood of the malware initiating a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control (C2) phase after collecting information during the Discovery phase.

To answer this, I need to consider the following:

- What typically happens after the Discovery phase in a malware's lifecycle?

- Is downloading via FTP a common method for C2 communications?

- Does the CTI outline provide any information about how the malware communicates with its C2 servers?

First, in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, after the Discovery phase, the malware may proceed to establish persistent access, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data, depending on its objectives.

Given that the malware has already collected sensitive information during the Discovery phase, it's likely that the next step would be to exfiltrate this data to the attackers' C2 servers.

Now, regarding the method of exfiltration, FTP is one possible protocol that malware can use to transfer data. However, FTP is not the most secure or stealthy method, as it's unencrypted and can be easily detected by network monitoring tools.

In modern malware, it's more common to see the use of encrypted channels for C2 communications, such as HTTPS, DNS tunneling, or even email, to avoid detection and to ensure the confidentiality of the exfiltrated data.

Given that the XAgent app is described as "advanced malware" and is similar to other SEDNIT malware, which is known for its sophistication, it's less likely that it would use an outdated and insecure protocol like FTP for C2 communications.

Additionally, the CTI outline doesn't mention anything about the malware using FTP or any specific protocol for C2 communications. The focus is on the malware's capabilities during the Initial Access, Execution, and Discovery phases, but there's no information provided about the C2 phase.

Therefore, based on the information given and the typical behaviors of advanced malware, it's unlikely that the malware would initiate a download via FTP as part of the C2 phase.

Hence, the answer to the question is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
