Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, stealing credentials and sensitive documents to carry out fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

First, I need to understand their attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's break it down:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They've been tracking victims since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They target specific industries and have a long dwell time, indicating thorough planning.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file operations, and proxying network traffic. Also, they have passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE that listen for HTTP requests and execute commands.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon functionality.

7. **Credential Access**: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. Trojanized KeePass is used to log newly entered passwords.

8. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

9. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

10. **Command and Control**: They use various methods for C2, including proxies, application and non-application layer protocols, and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After leveraging WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement across networks, is it likely that FIN13 will stage archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server before targeting specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

I need to evaluate whether it's likely for FIN13 to stage data archives on an OWA server before exfiltrating specific information for fraudulent transactions.

First, let's consider their exfiltration tactics. According to the CTI outline, they exfiltrate data over web services, using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories. So, they do use web-based methods for exfiltration.

Outlook Web Access (OWA) is a web-based interface for Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing users to access their email and calendar via a web browser. If FIN13 gains access to an OWA server, it could potentially be used as a staging ground for data, especially since it's web-accessible.

However, OWA is primarily designed for email and calendaring functions, not for storing arbitrary data archives. While it's possible to upload and download files through OWA, it's not typically used for hosting large archives.

Moreover, using OWA for staging data might raise alerts, especially if there are unusual activities or large data transfers. FIN13 is known for their stealth and long dwell times, so they likely prefer methods that are less likely to be detected.

Looking back at the CTI outline, they use web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories for exfiltration. This suggests that they prefer using web servers or other web-accessible applications for data exfiltration, rather than OWA.

Additionally, OWA servers are often well-protected and monitored, given their importance in email communications. Staging data on such a server might increase the risk of detection.

On the other hand, if FIN13 has already gained access to an OWA server as part of their lateral movement, they might consider it as an option for exfiltration, especially if it provides direct internet access.

But considering that they have other methods and tools specifically designed for exfiltration, such as web shells and JSP tools, it's less likely that they would choose to stage data on an OWA server, which is not typically used for data storage and could be more monitored.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it's not likely that FIN13 would stage archives of collected data on a target's OWA server before targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

So, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
