To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics used by the threat actor, FamousSparrow. The question is asking whether it's likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

First, let's look at the CTI outline and identify the sequence of tactics and techniques used by FamousSparrow.

1. **Resource Development**: The group exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples. They also acquired infrastructure from various hosting providers.

2. **Initial Access**: They gained initial access by exploiting these vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.

3. **Execution**: They used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor. They also exploited the same vulnerabilities to execute SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

4. **Persistence**: They created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Additionally, they used DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.

5. **Defense Evasion**: They injected encrypted shellcode (MpSvc.dll) into processes, attempted to adjust token privileges to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, and obfuscated files or information.

6. **Discovery**: SparrowDoor collected system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types. It also probed files in specified directories to obtain their names, attributes, sizes, and last modified times.

7. **Collection**: They could read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.

8. **Command and Control**: SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS with encrypted communications.

9. **Exfiltration**: Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

Now, the question is about the sequence of Discovery and Credential Access tactics. Specifically, it asks whether Discovery (collecting system information and probing files) happens only after Credential Access (dumping credentials using a custom Mimikatz).

Looking back at the CTI outline, I notice that Credential Access is not explicitly mentioned. The outline does not provide any details about how FamousSparrow obtains or uses credentials. There is mention of Defense Evasion techniques, including attempting to adjust token privileges to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, which could be related to credential access, but it's not directly stated.

Given that Credential Access is not explicitly detailed in the outline, I have to make an inference based on the information provided.

In general, during a cyber attack, the sequence of tactics can vary, but often, initial access and execution are followed by efforts to establish persistence and evade defenses. Discovery activities, such as gathering system information and probing files, typically occur early in the attack lifecycle to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.

Credential Access, on the other hand, is often performed to move laterally within the network or to access more sensitive areas. It's plausible that credentials are dumped after initial access and execution to facilitate further actions, including Discovery.

However, the question specifies that Discovery occurs only after Credential Access, which might not align with the typical sequence where Discovery often happens earlier.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention Credential Access using Mimikatz or any similar tool, and considering that Discovery activities are already part of the outlined tactics, I would argue that it's not necessarily the case that Discovery occurs only after Credential Access.

Moreover, the question mentions a "custom version of Mimikatz," which is not referenced in the CTI outline. Since the outline doesn't provide information about the use of Mimikatz or any specific Credential Access techniques, it's speculative to assume that Credential Access precedes Discovery.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it's not likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
