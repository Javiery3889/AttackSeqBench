Alright, I've got this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, especially in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. Let's break it down:

1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They focus on Mexico and specific industries.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

3. **Execution**: They use JSPRAT for command execution, file operations, and proxying network traffic. Also, they have passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE that listen for HTTP requests and execute commands via cmd.exe.

4. **Persistence**: They use various methods to maintain access, such as replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques, including ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex pivots, and use legitimate utilities like certutil to evade detection. They also use custom droppers and malware with recon functionality.

7. **Credential Access**: They obtain credentials through process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and targeting unsecured credentials. They trojanize KeePass to log newly entered passwords.

8. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely, archiving collected data using utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: After using WMI for lateral movement across the victim network, is FIN13 likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if the sequence makes sense based on the CTI outline.

First, FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement. That's明确 from the outline: they use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, with utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. So, lateral movement via WMI is confirmed.

Next, the question asks if they are likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

From the outline, under "Defense Evasion," it mentions that they use native OS utilities like certutil for detection evasion. Also, under "Privilege Escalation," they use ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials.

So, it's clear that they do use native OS binaries and tools for their operations, specifically for privilege escalation and defense evasion.

But the question is about using these native binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of internal reconnaissance, and whether this happens only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

From the "Credential Access" section, they do use memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials. They also target unsecured credentials and trojanize KeePass to log passwords.

So, they have multiple methods for credential access, including memory dumping and network sniffing.

Now, regarding leveraging native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials—this seems plausible.

Once they have credentials, they might use those credentials to access various systems and use native tools to gather more information about user accounts and the network.

However, the question specifies "only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing."

This seems a bit narrow. From the outline, they have multiple methods for credential access, not just memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

They also trojanize KeePass and target unsecured credentials. So, relying solely on memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing might not be accurate.

Moreover, even before gaining higher-level credentials, they might use native tools to gather information.

For example, they could use tools like net.exe, dsquery, or PowerShell scripts to enumerate user accounts and gather information, even with limited privileges.

So, the sequence suggested in the question—that they only leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing—might not be entirely accurate.

It's possible that they use native tools at various stages of their operation, not just after a specific credential-access method.

Additionally, the outline mentions that they use native OS utilities like certutil for defense evasion, but it doesn't specifically state that they use native binaries for gathering information on user accounts after a particular credential-access step.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it doesn't fully support the sequence outlined in the question.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

They likely use native OS binaries and scripts for various purposes throughout their operation, not solely for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

**Final Answer: B**
