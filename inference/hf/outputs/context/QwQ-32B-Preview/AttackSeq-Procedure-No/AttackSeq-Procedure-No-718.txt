To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if it suggests that the CopyKittens group uses Rclone for data exfiltration as part of their attack sequence.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - The group uses spear phishing emails with infected document files.
   - These documents contain OLE binary objects with deceptive names.

2. **Execution:**
   - The attack uses a multi-stage infection framework called 'Matryoshka'.
   - Stage one: A dropper (SCR PE file) obfuscates code and signals to the C2 server.
   - Stage two: A Reflective Loader uses anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques and injects a RAT library.
   - Stage three: The RAT component configures persistence, uses DNS for C2 communication, and provides common RAT functionalities.

3. **Persistence:**
   - The RAT copies the reflective loader to Windows folders and creates registry keys for auto-execution.
   - It schedules a task to rerun the injection routine every 20 minutes.

4. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Techniques include anti-debugging, anti-sandboxing, obfuscated strings, and using a global mutex.

5. **Credential Access:**
   - The RAT can steal Outlook passwords.

6. **Collection:**
   - The RAT has screen grabbing and keylogging capabilities.
   - Some source code is traced back to rohitab.com.

7. **Command and Control:**
   - The RAT uses DNS protocol for C2 communication, constructing queries with unique IDs, random strings, and obfuscated data.
   - Substitute ciphers are used to disguise DNS traffic, and C2 responses include IP addresses from reputable companies like Microsoft and McAfee.

8. **Others:**
   - The group is mid-level, develops homemade tools, and targets high-ranking diplomats and researchers in Middle East Studies.

Now, looking at the question: "After the RAT establishes DNS Command and Control communication by constructing unique DNS queries with obfuscated data, will the CopyKittens group exfiltrate victim data using applications such as Rclone as part of their attack sequence?"

The question is asking whether, as part of their attack sequence, the group uses Rclone for data exfiltration after establishing C2 communication.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the RAT has capabilities for screen grabbing and keylogging, which are collection techniques. However, there is no mention of how the exfiltration is performed. The outline mentions that the RAT uses DNS for C2 communication, but it doesn't specify how data is exfiltrated.

Rclone is a popular open-source tool for managing cloud storage and can be used for data transfer. It's possible that threat actors might use such tools for exfiltration, but in this specific case, there's no indication in the outline that the CopyKittens group uses Rclone or any similar tool for exfiltration.

Given that the outline provides detailed information about the attack sequence, including the use of a custom RAT with specific capabilities, it's reasonable to assume that if Rclone or any other specific tool was used for exfiltration, it would be mentioned.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
