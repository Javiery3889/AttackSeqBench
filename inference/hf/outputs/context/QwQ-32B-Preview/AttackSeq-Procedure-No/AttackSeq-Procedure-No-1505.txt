Alright, I've got this CTI outline about RIG EK, which is some kind of cyber threat. My task is to answer a question based on this outline, and I need to choose between "Yes" or "No." The question is: "After RIG EK's exploit server returns encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations, is it likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect?" Okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what RIG EK is. From the outline, it's described as an "exploit kit" that uses browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines. It sounds like it's a tool that threat actors use to deliver malware to victims' computers. The outline mentions that it uses techniques like "Obtain Capabilities" and "Compromise Infrastructure," which are part of the MITRE ATT&CK framework. So, it's sophisticated.

The question is focusing on the command and control (C2) operations of RIG EK. It mentions that the exploit server returns encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm to establish an encrypted channel for C2 operations. Then, it asks if it's likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

From the CTI outline, under "Defense Evasion," it's stated that "RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software." So, right there, it says that RIG EK uses proxy servers for evasion purposes.

Given that, the answer seems straightforward. Since the outline explicitly mentions that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, the answer should be "Yes."

But let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is asking specifically about the use of proxy servers within its infrastructure after the exploit server returns encrypted exploit code. The outline mentions that proxy servers are used to make infections harder to detect, which aligns with the question.

Additionally, the outline provides some context about RIG EK's operations, such as using malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page. This suggests that the entire operation is designed to be stealthy and evade detection, which further supports the use of proxy servers.

Also, the "Others" section mentions that RIG EK has been active since 2014 and targets outdated versions of Internet Explorer. It's been distributing various types of malware and has a high exploitation rate. The fact that it operates as a service model and has a relationship with the developer of Dridex malware indicates that it's a well-established and potentially sophisticated operation, which would likely employ various evasion techniques, including the use of proxy servers.

So, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it's clear that RIG EK uses proxy servers as part of its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect. Therefore, the answer to the question is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
