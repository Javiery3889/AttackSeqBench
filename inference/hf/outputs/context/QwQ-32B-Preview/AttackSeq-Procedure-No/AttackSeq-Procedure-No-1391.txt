Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat actor that Mandiant has been tracking since 2017, with activities dating back to 2016. They're active in Mexico and target financial, retail, and hospitality industries. Their main goal seems to be stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. They're known for long-term intrusions and using custom tools.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics outlined in the CTI report. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Reconnaissance**: FIN13 has been tracking targets since 2016, focusing on Mexico's financial, retail, and hospitality sectors. They map victim networks and capture credentials.

2. **Initial Access**: They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. The specific vulnerabilities aren't clear, but web shells are a consistent entry point.

3. **Execution**: Once inside, they use JSPRAT for command execution, file operations, and proxying network traffic. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which sets up a local HTTP server to receive commands.

4. **Persistence**: To maintain access, they replace legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords and use malware like SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based command and control.

5. **Privilege Escalation**: They use common techniques like dumping LSASS process memory with tools like ProcDump and extract credentials with Mimikatz. They also use certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.

6. **Defense Evasion**: They employ passive backdoors for stealth, chain web shells for complex movements, and use legitimate utilities to evade detection. Custom droppers and malware with recon functionality are also used.

7. **Discovery**: They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware to gather information about the network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

8. **Lateral Movement**: They use WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement, employing tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE. They also use Invoke-SMBExec and NIGHTJAR for cross-platform operations.

9. **Collection**: They collect data from network shared drives, stage it locally or remotely, and archive it using various utilities and libraries, focusing on data that aids in fraudulent transactions.

10. **Command and Control**: They use proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2. They transfer tools into the environment and encode data for communication.

11. **Exfiltration**: They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Now, the question is: "Is it likely that FIN13 will dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance?"

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to determine the sequence of their tactics, specifically whether privilege escalation (dumping LSASS) happens before discovery (gathering info on network and host configurations).

Looking back at the CTI outline:

- **Initial Access** is through web shells and custom malware on external servers.

- **Execution** involves using JSPRAT and passive backdoors.

- **Persistence** is established using trojanized KeePass and other malware.

- **Privilege Escalation** is mentioned after persistence, using tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz.

- **Discovery** comes after privilege escalation, using native OS binaries and custom malware for reconnaissance.

- **Lateral Movement** follows discovery, using WMI and other tools.

- **Collection** happens after lateral movement, gathering data from network shares.

- **Command and Control** and **Exfiltration** are the final stages.

So, based on this sequence:

1. Initial Access

2. Execution

3. Persistence

4. Privilege Escalation

5. Discovery

6. Lateral Movement

7. Collection

8. Command and Control

9. Exfiltration

The question is asking if dumping LSASS (Privilege Escalation) happens before discovery.

According to this sequence, privilege escalation occurs before discovery.

But let's think about it logically. Typically, in a cyber attack, after gaining initial access and establishing persistence, threat actors often escalate privileges to gain more control over the system. Once they have higher privileges, they can perform more actions, including gathering detailed information about the network and host configurations.

In this case, dumping LSASS process memory is a privilege escalation technique used to obtain credentials, which can then be used for further lateral movement and discovery.

So, it makes sense that they would dump LSASS (privilege escalation) before conducting extensive discovery activities, as having higher privileges would give them better access to the information they need.

Additionally, the CTI outline mentions that they use the obtained credentials for mapping victim networks and capturing credentials, which aligns with the discovery phase.

Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 dumps LSASS process memory for credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations.

Hence, the answer should be A: Yes.

But to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any scenario where discovery happens before privilege escalation.

Perhaps, in some cases, threat actors might perform initial discovery to understand the environment before deciding how to escalate privileges. However, in FIN13's case, the outline suggests that privilege escalation comes after persistence and before discovery.

Also, given their long dwell time and methodical approach, it's plausible that they first ensure they have a solid foothold and elevated privileges before conducting extensive reconnaissance.

Therefore, based on both the outlined sequence and logical deduction, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
