I have a CTI outline that describes an attack by a group called Agrius. I need to answer a question about their tactics based on this outline. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It talks about different stages of the attack, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework categories like Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control.

**Initial Access:**
- Agrius gained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications.
- They exploited specific vulnerabilities like FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and used 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection.
- Successful exploitation allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- They deployed custom malware, a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'.
- This backdoor was used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware.
- It was registered as a service for persistence and could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 server commands.

**Persistence:**
- They achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Webshells had variations of ASPXSpy, some obfuscated with custom base64 encoding.
- 'IPsec Helper' had functionality to update its engine and delete traces to evade detection.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts.
- Utilized publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, using a configuration file with encrypted server addresses.
- It awaited commands like updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is: "Before the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files, is Agrius likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper that initially failed execution and the 'DEADWOOD' malware to overwrite files as part of its data destruction activities?"

Answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

I need to determine whether Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' before 'IPsec Helper' awaits specific commands.

First, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD'. Scanning the outline, I don't see these names mentioned. So, this information is not directly provided in the outline.

However, the question mentions that 'Apostle' initially failed execution. This suggests that 'Apostle' is a piece of malware that Agrius tried to deploy but it didn't work as expected.

The question is asking whether, before 'IPsec Helper' waits for commands to send recon or download files, Agrius is likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' for data destruction.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't mention 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD', I need to infer based on the information provided.

From the outline, Agrius's main activities are:

1. Gaining initial access through exploiting public-facing applications.

2. Uploading webshells for lateral movement.

3. Deploying 'IPsec Helper' for persistence, execution of commands, and communication with C2 servers.

4. Using webshells and RDP for lateral movement.

5. Communicating with C2 servers to receive commands like sending recon information and downloading files.

There's no mention of data destruction activities like deploying wipers or overwriting files.

The question introduces 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' as wipers for data destruction, but these are not part of the outlined tactics.

Given that, it seems unlikely that Agrius is deploying wipers as part of the activities described in the outline. The outline focuses on initial access, persistence, lateral movement, and command and control, but not on data destruction.

Therefore, the answer should be "No", Agrius is not likely to deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' before 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands to send recon information or download files, based on the provided CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B**
