Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the FamousSparrow group and a question about their exfiltration methods. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics outlined in the CTI report. So, starting with Resource Development, it says that FamousSparrow exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples. They got their infrastructure from various hosting providers.

Next, Initial Access was through exploiting those remote code execution vulnerabilities in those internet-facing applications. Makes sense.

Then, Execution: they used cmd.exe to download and install SparrowDoor backdoor, and also exploited the same vulnerabilities to execute it on the systems.

Persistence: they created a registry Run key for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Also, they used DLL search order hijacking to load a malicious DLL called K7UI.dll.

Privilege Escalation: no specific details provided in the report.

Defense Evasion: they injected encrypted shellcode (MpSvc.dll) into processes, tried to adjust token privileges to get SeDebugPrivilege, and obfuscated files and configuration data within SparrowDoor.

Credential Access: they used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from the compromised systems.

Discovery: SparrowDoor collected system information like usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, drive types, and probed files in specific directories to get their names, attributes, sizes, and last modified times.

Collection: they could read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.

Command and Control: SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.

Now, the question is: Is FamousSparrow likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS and multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to decide between Yes and No based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Let's think about this. The outline mentions that they can read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server, and that SparrowDoor communicates via HTTPS with encrypted communications using multi-byte XOR keys.

But, it doesn't specify any timing for the exfiltration, like every 10 minutes, or any scheduled transfer method.

So, based on the information given, there's no direct mention of exfiltration happening every 10 minutes or any scheduling.

However, it's possible that SparrowDoor has the capability to schedule tasks, but that's not mentioned here.

Moreover, the group is described as engaging in cyberespionage, which often involves stealth and avoiding detection, so they might prefer less frequent exfiltration to avoid drawing attention.

But again, that's speculative.

Given that the CTI outline doesn't provide specifics about the exfiltration schedule, I don't have enough information to confirm that they exfiltrate every 10 minutes using a scheduled method.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be B: No, because there's no evidence in the outline to support the specific claim of exfiltrating every 10 minutes via a scheduled transfer method.

I need to base my answer strictly on the information provided, and since it's not mentioned, it's safer to go with No.

So, Final Answer: B
