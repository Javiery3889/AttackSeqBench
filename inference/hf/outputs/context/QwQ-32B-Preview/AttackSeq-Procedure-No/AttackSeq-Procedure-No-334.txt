To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if there's any information that suggests the use of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with C&C servers.

First, let's look at the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - ESET researchers and Citizen Lab discovered a version of Hacking Team's RCS spyware signed with a new valid digital certificate.
   - The spyware was found in an executable file disguised as a PDF document, attached to spearphishing emails targeting diplomats.

2. **Command and Control:**
   - Several C&C servers were identified with specific IP addresses.
   
3. **Others:**
   - ESET's analysis shows active development of spyware samples between September 2015 and October 2017.
   - Samples were signed with certificates issued to various entities.
   - Versioning continues from before the breach and follows the same patterns.
   - Functionality overlaps with leaked source code, with no significant updates.
   - Detected in fourteen countries.

Now, the question is asking about a specific technique used after gaining initial access: placing a portable FAT16 partition image in the %TEMP% directory as a hidden file system before communicating with C&C servers.

Looking back at the CTI outline, there is no mention of any specific techniques used post-initial access, such as creating a portable partition image in %TEMP% or using a hidden file system. The outline provides information about the initial access vector (spearphishing emails with disguised executables) and the C&C servers, but details about the post-compromise activities are not provided.

Given this lack of information, I need to consider whether it's plausible to assume that this specific technique was used based on the information provided.

Firstly, the outline mentions that the spyware is a version of Hacking Team's RCS, which is known to be a sophisticated surveillance tool. Sophisticated malware often employs various techniques to maintain persistence and hide its presence, including using hidden file systems or unusual storage methods.

However, without specific evidence or mention in the CTI outline about the use of a FAT16 partition image in %TEMP%, I cannot confirm that this technique was used. The outline doesn't provide details about the malware's post-infection behavior beyond the initial delivery method and the presence of C&C servers.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, I cannot conclude that the authors used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with C&C servers.

So, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
