Alright, I have this CTI outline about an attack by the Konni APT Group, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. It starts with initial access through an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL. This ISO contains a zip file with malicious scripts. So, the attack begins with delivering these scripts to the target system.

Next, there's the execution phase. Several VBScripts and batch files are involved here. There's 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'. Each of these seems to have specific roles:

- 'install.vbs' deobfuscates and executes 'resolve.dns'.

- 'update.vbs' is similar to 'install.vbs' and executes 'stopedge.bat'.

- 'activate.vbs' sends an HTTP request and saves the retrieved content.

- 'unactivate.vbs' can exfiltrate data via a POST request.

- 'stopedge.bat' manages scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes and deletes certain files after execution.

- 'resolvedns.bat' downloads a file from the C2 server.

- 'versioninfo.bat' collects system information and exfiltrates it using 'unactivate.vbs'.

So, it's a pretty involved sequence of events where these scripts work together to execute commands, collect data, and communicate with the command and control server.

Now, under defense evasion, it mentions that the scripts are heavily obfuscated to avoid detection, and 'stopedge.bat' deletes files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after they've been executed. This is to remove traces and make it harder for defenders to find indicators of compromise.

Discovery involves 'versioninfo.bat' gathering information about the system, like directory listings, IP addresses, running processes, etc.

Collection is about gathering this information for exfiltration.

Command and control involves communication with the C2 server via HTTP requests.

Exfiltration is handled by 'unactivate.vbs' through POST requests.

Alright, so that's the attack sequence as per the CTI outline.

Now, the question is: After 'stopedge.bat' manages the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion, is it likely that persistence will be established by using kernel modules such as in the techniques employed by Drovorub or Skidmap?

Answer choices are A: Yes or B: No.

So, I need to decide between yes and no based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about whether, after 'stopedge.bat' deletes certain files to evade detection, the attack is likely to establish persistence using kernel modules, similar to what Drovorub or Skidmap do.

I need to think about whether the Konni APT Group, as described in the outline, uses kernel-level persistence techniques.

Looking back at the outline, under "Persistence," it's not directly mentioned, but 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes. This seems like a way to maintain persistence at the userland level by repeatedly executing the initial script.

However, the question is about kernel-level persistence, like what Drovorub or Skidmap use.

Drovorub and Skidmap are known for their use of kernel-level rootkits to achieve persistence. Drovorub, for example, is associated with the Turla APT group and uses kernel drivers to maintain persistence and hide its activities. Skidmap is another kernel-level persistence mechanism.

So, the question is asking if, based on the Konni APT Group's tactics described in the outline, it's likely that they would use similar kernel-level techniques for persistence.

Looking back at the outline, the persistence mechanism mentioned is scheduling 'install.vbs' via 'stopedge.bat' to run every 33 minutes. This is a userland persistence technique, not kernel-level.

There's no mention of any kernel module manipulation or driver installation in the outline.

Moreover, the "Others" section identifies Konni APT Group as originating from North Korea, primarily targeting South Korea, and their modus operandi involves spear-phishing emails and malicious documents. Their objectives are data exfiltration and espionage.

While they are an APT group, the tactics described in the outline seem to focus on userland activities: executing scripts, collecting information, communicating with C2 servers, and deleting files to evade detection.

There's no indication that they are employing kernel-level techniques in this particular attack sequence.

Comparing this to Drovorub or Skidmap, which are known for their use of kernel-level rootkits, it seems that Konni is taking a different approach, sticking to userland persistence.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it doesn't seem likely that Konni is using kernel modules for persistence in this attack.

So, the answer should be B: No.

But let me double-check.

Is there any hint in the outline that suggests kernel-level activities? Not that I can see. The focus is on scripts and batch files, which are typically userland executables.

Also, the defense evasion techniques mentioned are file deletions and script obfuscation, again userland activities.

Therefore, there's no reason to believe that kernel-level persistence is being employed here.

Hence, the most plausible answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
