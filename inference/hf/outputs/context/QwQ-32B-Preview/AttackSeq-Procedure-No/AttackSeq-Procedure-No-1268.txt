To answer this question, I need to analyze the provided CTI outline and determine whether it's likely that the attackers, after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, would enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step.

**Reconnaissance:**
- Symantec identified attacks against U.S. organizations aimed at deploying WastedLocker ransomware.
- The threat actor is linked to the group 'Evil Corp'.
- They used a malicious JavaScript-based framework called SocGholish on over 150 compromised websites to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.

**Initial Access:**
- The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
- Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
- This led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, which profiled the computer and downloaded additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

**Execution:**
- Attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader.
- The loader contained a .NET injector taken from an open-source project called Donut.
- This was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload, which is capable of command execution, process injection, privilege escalation, and file upload/download.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Privilege escalation was achieved using a publicly documented technique involving the Software Licensing User Interface tool (slui.exe).
- They also used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- PsExec was used to launch a command line tool for managing Windows Defender, disabling scanning, removing definitions, and in some cases, disabling real-time monitoring.
- PsExec was also used to stop services across the organization before launching the WastedLocker ransomware.

**Credential Access:**
- Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
- They also emptied log files to aid in concealing their activities.

**Lateral Movement:**
- The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.

**Command and Control:**
- The injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a command and control (C&C) domain, which was publicly reported as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.

**Impact:**
- The end goal was to cripple the victim's IT infrastructure by encrypting computers and servers, leading to significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Targeted Attack Cloud Analytics, using advanced machine learning, proactively detected the attacks.
- The Threat Hunter team verified the activity, which corresponded to the early stages of WastedLocker attacks.
- This discovery helped identify additional targeted organizations and strengthen protection against the attack.
- Symantec has alerted at least 31 customer organizations to the threat, with the majority being major U.S. corporations, including 11 listed companies and eight Fortune 500 companies.
- The attackers demonstrated skill and experience, capable of penetrating well-protected corporations, stealing credentials, and moving across networks with ease.
- Symantec has implemented file-based protection and intrusion prevention measures to protect against WastedLocker and associated activities.
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) including domains and IP addresses linked to the attacks have been reported to the relevant registrar, with assistance from Namecheap in suspending some domains.
- The Critical Attack Discovery and Intelligence team within Symantec is dedicated to investigating targeted attacks, enhancing protection in Symantec products, and providing analysis to help customers respond to attacks.

Now, looking at the question: "Is it likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery?"

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

To answer this, I need to consider whether the attack sequence described in the CTI outline suggests that the attackers would enumerate AWS infrastructure.

First, let's consider the context:

- The attack targets U.S. organizations, many of which are major corporations and Fortune 500 companies.

- These organizations are likely to use a variety of cloud services, including AWS.

- The attackers are skilled and experienced, as they can penetrate well-protected corporations, steal credentials, and move laterally across networks.

Given that, it's plausible that these organizations use AWS, and therefore, the attackers might try to enumerate AWS infrastructure to expand their access and impact.

However, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention AWS or any cloud services. The activities described are focused on compromising on-premises Windows systems, using tools like wscript.exe, PowerShell, Cobalt Strike, slui.exe, wmic.exe, and PsExec.

None of these tools or techniques are specifically associated with AWS enumeration. While it's possible that the attackers could use credentials obtained from the compromised systems to access AWS management consoles or APIs, there's no direct evidence in the outline to support this.

Moreover, the main objective of the attack is to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, which targets files on computers and servers, causing disruption and demanding ransom. Enumerating AWS infrastructure might be outside the scope of their immediate goals, unless they plan to encrypt AWS resources as well.

However, considering that major corporations often have AWS resources, and that ransomware groups might want to maximize their impact by encrypting as much data as possible, including cloud-based resources, it's not entirely unlikely that they would attempt to enumerate AWS infrastructure.

But based on the information provided in the CTI outline, there's no direct indication that the attackers performed AWS enumeration.

Therefore, while it's possible, it's not directly supported by the given information.

Given that, and considering that the question asks whether it's "likely" based on the provided CTI outline, I would lean towards "No," because the outline doesn't provide any evidence or indication of AWS enumeration.

Hence, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
