Alright, I've got this CTI outline about an attack by Shuckworm on a Ukrainian organization, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence as described in the CTI outline. It mentions that the attack started on July 14, 2021, with a malicious document likely delivered via phishing email. This document contained a custom backdoor called Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command. So, the initial access vector seems to be a phishing email with a malicious attachment.

Next, under Execution, it says that after the initial compromise, Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor. They also created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence and executed commands via scripts. On July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed, and on July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload for the attack.

Persistence was established by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes, ensuring that the backdoor remained active even after system reboots.

For Defense Evasion, they used mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings. Scheduled tasks and VBS scripts were also used to evade detection and maintain their foothold.

Under Collection, between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts. It's unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of their efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

In the "Others" section, there's background information about Shuckworm, also known as Gamaredon or Armageddon, being active since at least 2013 and increasing the sophistication of their attacks recently. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) reported that Shuckworm has been using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks.

Symantec's investigation revealed seven files used by Shuckworm in their attacks, all of which are 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries, including various VBS files, a VNC client, and a Process Explorer binary. IOCs showed C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers and suspected malicious files found in specific directories with names starting with the letter 'd'. The SSU report attributed over 5,000 attacks to Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

Now, the question is: After utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, is Shuckworm likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems?

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to see if the CTI outline suggests that Shuckworm uses such sophisticated C2 channels involving GOGETTER tunneler and Yamux.

Looking back at the outline, under Initial Access and Execution, they used a malicious document with Pterodo backdoor, executed VBS scripts, HTA files, and created scheduled tasks. On July 28, they installed a VNC client as the ultimate payload.

Under Persistence, they created scheduled tasks to execute malicious VBS files.

For Defense Evasion, they used mshta.exe and scheduled tasks to evade detection.

Under Collection, they deployed multiple variants of their VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.

There's no mention of GOGETTER tunneler or Yamux in the outline. The communication with C&C servers is only mentioned in the question, not in the outline. The outline doesn't specify the type of C2 channels or protocols used beyond HTTP requests.

Given that, I need to infer whether Shuckworm is likely to use such a tunneler based on the information provided.

The "Others" section mentions that Shuckworm has increased the sophistication of their attacks recently, and they use living-off-the-land tools for credential theft and lateral movement. This suggests that they are evolving and using more advanced techniques.

However, the specific tools and techniques mentioned in the outline are relatively basic: phishing emails, malicious documents, VBS scripts, HTA files, scheduled tasks, and a VNC client. There's no indication of using advanced tunnelling software like GOGETTER.

GOGETTER is known to be a tunneler that establishes a Yamux TLS-based C2 channel, which is more sophisticated than the methods described in the outline.

Given that the outline doesn't mention GOGETTER or any similar tunnelling software, and considering that the observed tactics are more rudimentary, I would lean towards saying that it's unlikely that Shuckworm is using GOGETTER in this attack sequence.

Therefore, the answer should be B: No.

But let me double-check. The question says "is Shuckworm likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a 'Yamux' TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems?"

Given that the outline shows they are using HTTP requests for C&C communication and deploying payloads like Pterodo and VNC, but not mentioning any advanced tunnelling software, it seems less likely that they are using GOGETTER in this particular attack.

Moreover, the outline doesn't provide any indicators related to GOGETTER or Yamux, which further supports the notion that it's not being used here.

Hence, my final answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
