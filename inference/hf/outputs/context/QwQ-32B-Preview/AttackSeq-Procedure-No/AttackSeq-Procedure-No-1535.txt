Alright, I've got this CTI outline about an attack by the Konni APT Group, and I need to answer a question based on it. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. The outline lists several tactics: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. Each of these corresponds to a phase in the attack lifecycle.

Starting with Initial Access:

- The attack begins with an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild (ITW) URL. This ISO contains a zip file with malicious scripts.

So, the entry point is through a malicious ISO file downloaded from the internet.

Next, Execution:

- Several VBScripts and batch files are executed.

- 'install.vbs' deobfuscates and runs 'resolve.dns' (which is likely 'resolvedns.bat').

- 'update.vbs' is similar to 'install.vbs' and runs 'stopedge.bat'.

- 'activate.vbs' sends an HTTP request and saves the content.

- 'unactivate.vbs' can exfiltrate data via a POST request.

- 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists and manages file deletions.

- 'resolvedns.bat' downloads a file from the C2 server.

- 'versioninfo.bat' collects system information and exfiltrates it using 'unactivate.vbs'.

Alright, so there's a chain of scripts being executed, each with specific tasks.

Persistence:

- 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.

This ensures that the initial access script is run periodically, maintaining a foothold on the system.

Discovery:

- 'versioninfo.bat' gathers information about the system, like directory listings, IP addresses, running processes, and system details.

Collection:

- 'versioninfo.bat' collects this information for exfiltration.

Command and Control:

- 'activate.vbs' communicates with the C2 server to send requests and receive content.

- 'resolvedns.bat' also communicates with the C2 to download files.

Exfiltration:

- 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrates data via POST requests.

- 'versioninfo.bat' uses 'unactivate.vbs' to exfiltrate collected information.

Now, looking at the "Others" section:

- Konni APT Group is believed to be from North Korea, targeting South Korea.

- They use spear-phishing emails and malicious documents.

- Objectives include data exfiltration and espionage.

- The report includes MITRE ATT&CK techniques, mitigations, and a YARA rule for detection.

Alright, that's the background. Now, the question is:

"Is it likely that the 'stopedge.bat' script will manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection before the 'versioninfo.bat' script discovers system details and collects information for exfiltration?"

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

So, I need to determine whether 'stopedge.bat' deletes certain files, like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs', before 'versioninfo.bat' can run and collect system information.

Looking back at the outline:

- 'stopedge.bat' is executed by 'update.vbs'.

- If 'paycom.ini' exists in the directory, 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes and manages file deletions.

- 'versioninfo.bat' is responsible for discovery and collection.

The key here is understanding the sequence in which these scripts run and when deletions occur.

First, the attack starts with the ISO file containing a zip with malicious scripts.

- The user likely mounts the ISO and extracts the zip.

- Inside the zip are the VBScripts and batch files.

- 'install.vbs' is probably the initial script that gets executed.

- 'install.vbs' deobfuscates and runs 'resolvedns.bat'.

- 'resolvedns.bat' downloads a file from the C2 server.

- Presumably, this downloaded file includes 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'versioninfo.bat', etc.

- 'update.vbs' is similar to 'install.vbs' and runs 'stopedge.bat'.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. User downloads and mounts ISO.

2. User extracts zip, which contains malicious scripts.

3. 'install.vbs' is executed, which runs 'resolvedns.bat'.

4. 'resolvedns.bat' downloads additional files from C2.

5. 'update.vbs' is likely part of these downloaded files and executes 'stopedge.bat'.

6. 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists and manages file deletions.

7. 'versioninfo.bat' runs to collect system information and exfiltrates it using 'unactivate.vbs'.

Now, the question is about whether 'stopedge.bat' deletes files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before 'versioninfo.bat' can run.

From the outline, 'stopedge.bat' manages file deletions, but it's not specified exactly which files it deletes or when.

However, 'stopedge.bat' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists, and it's responsible for scheduling 'install.vbs' and managing deletions.

Given that, it's possible that 'stopedge.bat' deletes certain files to clean up the system and evade detection.

But, 'versioninfo.bat' needs to run to collect system information before any deletion occurs.

So, the timing is crucial here.

If 'stopedge.bat' deletes files after 'versioninfo.bat' has already run and exfiltrated the data, then it's fine.

But if 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' before it can run, that would be a problem for the attackers.

Given that 'stopedge.bat' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes, and assuming 'versioninfo.bat' runs before that, it's possible that 'versioninfo.bat' has already collected and exfiltrated the data before 'stopedge.bat' deletes any files.

Alternatively, if 'stopedge.bat' deletes files immediately upon execution, and 'versioninfo.bat' is scheduled to run after 'stopedge.bat', then 'versioninfo.bat' might be deleted before it can run.

But according to the outline, 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists, and manages file deletions.

It doesn't specify when 'versioninfo.bat' is run.

However, 'versioninfo.bat' is part of the discovery and collection phases, which likely occur after initial access and persistence have been established.

So, it's probable that 'versioninfo.bat' runs after 'stopedge.bat' has been executed at least once.

Given that, there's a risk that 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' before it can run.

But, considering that 'stopedge.bat' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes, and 'versioninfo.bat' is likely run sooner in the attack chain, it's possible that 'versioninfo.bat' runs before the scheduled deletion.

Alternatively, perhaps 'stopedge.bat' only deletes certain files, not necessarily 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs'.

The outline doesn't specify exactly which files 'stopedge.bat' deletes.

Given the uncertainty, I need to make an educated guess based on the information provided.

The question is whether it's likely that 'stopedge.bat' will manage the deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before 'versioninfo.bat' can run and collect information.

Given that 'stopedge.bat' is responsible for managing file deletions and is scheduled to run periodically, it's possible that it deletes certain files to clean up the system and reduce the footprint.

However, 'versioninfo.bat' is crucial for collecting system information, so it's unlikely that the attackers would delete it before it serves its purpose.

Perhaps 'stopedge.bat' deletes temporary files or other scripts that have already served their purpose, but keeps 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' for continued use.

Alternatively, 'stopedge.bat' might delete files that are no longer needed or that could raise suspicion, but ensure that essential scripts like 'versioninfo.bat' remain.

But, without specific information on which files are deleted, I can't be certain.

Looking back at the outline, it mentions that 'stopedge.bat' manages file deletions, but doesn't specify which files.

Therefore, it's uncertain whether 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' are deleted by 'stopedge.bat' before they can perform their functions.

Given that, I need to consider the likelihood.

If 'stopedge.bat' deletes files that are no longer needed, and 'versioninfo.bat' is needed for collection, it's less likely to be deleted prematurely.

On the other hand, if 'stopedge.bat' deletes files in a way that could interfere with 'versioninfo.bat' running, then there's a risk.

But, considering that 'stopedge.bat' is scheduled to run every 33 minutes and manages deletions, it's possible that it deletes certain files after they have been used.

Therefore, it's likely that 'stopedge.bat' manages deletions in a way that doesn't interfere with 'versioninfo.bat' running.

Hence, the answer is probably "No", it's not likely that 'stopedge.bat' will delete 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' before they can perform their functions.

So, the answer
