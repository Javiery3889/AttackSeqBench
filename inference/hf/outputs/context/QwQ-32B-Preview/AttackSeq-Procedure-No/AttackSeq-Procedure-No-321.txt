I've got this CTI outline about Operation Pawn Storm, focusing on some iOS malware called XAgent. It seems like this malware is part of a larger campaign, and it's related to other malware used in Windows systems. My task is to answer a question about the malware's behavior, specifically regarding how it handles the information it collects and how it communicates back to its command and control server.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline properly. It mentions that the malware is installed on already compromised systems, which suggests that it's likely a second-stage payload. It's designed to be stealthy, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices and restarting automatically if killed. However, on iOS 8, it doesn't hide its icon and can't restart automatically, indicating that it might have been developed before iOS 8 was released.

The malware is capable of collecting a variety of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, and even starting voice recordings. It can also gather information about installed apps and running processes, as well as the device's Wi-Fi status.

Now, looking at the question: "After the app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations, is it likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device?" The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No."

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention how the malware communicates with its C&C server. It talks about the malware collecting various types of information, but it doesn't specify the protocols used for exfiltrating that data.

However, the question mentions that the app uploads files via FTP as part of its C&C operations. So, it seems that FTP is one of the methods used for communicating with the C&C server. The question is asking whether, after using FTP to upload files, the malware is likely to send gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the device.

Let me break this down. The malware collects various types of information, and then it needs to send that information back to the attackers. The question is suggesting that it first uploads files via FTP and then sends other information via HTTP after performing certain routines on the device.

But the CTI outline doesn't provide explicit details about the sequence of actions or the protocols used for exfiltration. It only mentions that the malware collects various data but doesn't specify how it sends that data back.

Given that, I need to make an educated guess based on the information provided. The malware is described as being advanced and similar to other SEDNIT malware used in Windows systems. SEDNIT is known for its sophisticated tactics, so it's likely that this iOS malware is also designed to use multiple communication methods.

The fact that it uses FTP for uploading files suggests that it might use different protocols for different types of data. Perhaps FTP is used for larger files like pictures or recorded voices, while HTTP is used for smaller, more immediate data like text messages or contact lists.

Additionally, the question mentions "after performing routines on the iOS device." I assume this refers to the data collection activities listed in the CTI outline.

So, considering all this, it seems plausible that the malware would first upload files via FTP and then send other collected information via HTTP after those file uploads are complete.

Therefore, I would倾向于选择 "Yes" as the answer, meaning that it is likely to send gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

But let me think differently. Maybe the malware is designed to send data concurrently via multiple protocols, depending on the type of data. In that case, it might not wait for FTP uploads to complete before sending other information via HTTP.

However, the question specifically says "only after performing routines on the iOS device." So, perhaps the malware collects all the data first and then sends it in a specific order, using FTP for files and HTTP for other data.

Given the stealthy nature of the malware and the fact that it's designed to be resilient (restarting automatically on iOS 7), it's likely that it has a structured way of exfiltrating data to avoid detection.

Therefore, I think "Yes" is the more plausible answer.

**Final Answer: A**
