Alright, I've got this CTI outline to analyze, and there's a specific question about whether attackers are likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement after using tools like ADFind and port scanning. So, I need to look through the outline, understand the attack sequence, and then evaluate the answer choices based on that information.

First, let's break down the CTI outline step by step.

**Initial Access:**

- The attack starts with an initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon.

- The beacon is installed and executed in various forms, either as a stager or stageless.

- It communicates with the C&C server using HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.

- For internal networks, an SMB beacon is used.

- The 'spawn' feature is used to run beacons in normal processes to avoid detection.

- The 'malleable C&C profile' feature modifies C&C traffic to evade network detection.

So, in this phase, the attackers get a foothold in the network using Cobalt Strike.

**Privilege Escalation:**

- After initial access, attackers seek to escalate privileges to obtain admin credentials for lateral movement.

- They use Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz feature to steal account information but need higher privileges than Administrator to run it.

- To achieve the necessary privilege escalation, they use UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities, sometimes employing third-party tools.

This phase is about gaining higher privileges to move laterally within the network.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Cobalt Strike offers techniques to bypass detection by security products.

- It manipulates packets for network communications to make HTTP and HTTPS beacon communications hard to detect.

- The beacon operates as a process with settings to avoid detection of suspicious processes.

- It can also bypass memory-based detections by altering the form of the beacon in memory.

This part is about avoiding detection by security solutions.

**Discovery:**

- After gaining escalated privileges, attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to collect information about the network and connected PCs.

- ADFind is a command-line tool used to gather Active Directory information, including domain controllers, subnets, computers in the domain, and Active Directory details of the current system.

This phase is about understanding the environment and identifying targets for lateral movement.

**Others:**

- The report discusses various cases where Cobalt Strike was used in different stages of cyber attacks, including distribution, installation, and lateral movement.

- It also covers ransomware cases exploiting Cobalt Strike, such as BlueCrab, Hancitor, and others.

- The report highlights ransomware attacks targeting Korean companies and examines cases like CLOP, Conti, DarkSide, and Ryuk.

- Recommendations for security managers are provided, emphasizing monitoring of Administrator accounts, disabling unnecessary ports, and keeping software and security products updated.

Now, the question is: After using tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process, is it likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement?

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

To answer this, I need to consider whether, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement is a likely step after the discovery phase.

First, let's recall that in the discovery phase, attackers use ADFind and port scanning to gather information about the network and Active Directory. This would give them a map of the environment, including servers, workstations, domain controllers, and possibly service accounts and their privileges.

Given that they have gathered this information, their next step would typically be lateral movement to access more sensitive parts of the network or to reach their final target.

Now, regarding AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) and SAML tokens:

- AD FS is a federation service that allows for single sign-on across different domains or forests.

- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) tokens are used for authentication and authorization in federated environments.

If attackers have compromised an AD FS server and obtained SAML tokens, they could potentially use these tokens to authenticate to other systems that trust the AD FS server, thereby moving laterally within the network.

However, looking back at the CTI outline, there is no explicit mention of AD FS or SAML tokens being compromised or used by the attackers. The outline discusses the use of Cobalt Strike for initial access, privilege escalation, defense evasion, and discovery, but does not specify the particular techniques used for lateral movement beyond mentioning the use of SMB beacons for internal networks.

Moreover, in the privilege escalation section, it mentions using Mimikatz to steal account information, which is a common technique for obtaining credentials, including those that could be used for lateral movement. But again, there's no specific reference to AD FS or SAML tokens.

In the "Others" section, there are mentions of various ransomware cases and how Cobalt Strike was used in those attacks, but again, no specific detail about AD FS or SAML token abuse.

Given this, I need to consider whether, based on the outlined attack sequence, it is likely that attackers would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.

On one hand, if attackers have gathered detailed Active Directory information using ADFind, they might identify an AD FS server as a high-value target and attempt to compromise it. If successful, they could indeed use SAML tokens for lateral movement.

On the other hand, the CTI outline doesn't provide any direct evidence or indication that AD FS servers or SAML tokens are being targeted or compromised in this attack sequence.

Therefore, while it's possible that attackers might abuse AD FS SAML tokens for lateral movement in some scenarios, based solely on the information provided in this CTI outline, it's not explicitly supported.

Considering the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Given the lack of specific information about AD FS or SAML tokens in the CTI outline, I would lean towards answer B: No. The outline doesn't provide sufficient evidence to conclude that abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token is a likely step in this particular attack sequence.

However, to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's consider if there are any indirect indications that might suggest otherwise.

In the discovery phase, attackers are gathering information about the network and Active Directory. If they identify an AD FS server, they might target it for compromise. But again, this is speculative based on the given outline.

Moreover, the outline mentions that attackers use Cobalt Strike for lateral movement, specifically mentioning the use of SMB beacons for internal networks. This suggests that they are using more traditional methods for lateral movement, such as exploiting SMB protocols, rather than leveraging AD FS SAML tokens.

Additionally, the privilege escalation techniques mentioned involve using Mimikatz to steal credentials, which could include domain credentials that are sufficient for lateral movement without necessarily needing to abuse AD FS SAML tokens.

Therefore, while AD FS SAML token abuse is a possible technique, it doesn't seem to be directly supported or indicated by the information provided in the CTI outline.

In conclusion, based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, it is not likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
