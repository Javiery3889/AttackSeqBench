To answer this question, I need to analyze the provided CTI outline and understand the sequence of tactics and techniques used in the CostaRicto Campaign. The question is asking whether, after the Discovery phase, the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control channel.

First, let's break down the CTI outline:

1. **Initial Access:**
   - Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
   - SSH tools were used for remote tunneling, redirecting traffic from malicious domains to a local proxy using the attackers' private keys.
   - Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed via scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

2. **Execution:**
   - The 64-bit backdoor was deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
   - A PowerShell loader based on Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection was used to inject the payload DLL into memory.
   - The 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader called CostaBricks to decode and inject the payload.

3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
   - Deobfuscation of files or information related to SombRAT.

4. **Discovery:**
   - SombRAT has capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
   - Tools like pscan and nmap were used for network service scanning.

5. **Collection:**
   - Collected data was archived using a custom storage file format.

6. **Exfiltration:**
   - Data was exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

Now, focusing on the Discovery phase, the backdoor performs process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery. Additionally, network scanning tools like pscan and nmap were used.

The question is about what happens after the Discovery phase regarding the C2 infrastructure. Specifically, whether the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

To answer this, I need to look for any information in the CTI outline that mentions how the C2 channel is established or what infrastructure is used for C2 communications.

Looking back at the Initial Access section, it mentions that SSH tools were used for remote tunneling, redirecting traffic from malicious domains to a local proxy using the attackers' private keys. This suggests that the attackers set up a tunnel to communicate with the victim's network.

However, there is no explicit mention of blogs or WordPress being used for C2 infrastructure in the provided outline.

Given that, I need to consider whether it's likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure based on the information provided.

Let's consider the following points:

- The initial access involved SSH tunneling and malicious domains.
- The backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel.
- There is no direct mention of blogs or WordPress in the CTI outline.

Given that there is no explicit reference to blogs or WordPress being used for C2 infrastructure in the CTI outline, it's not directly supported by the provided information.

Therefore, based on the information given, it is not likely that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

Hence, the answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
