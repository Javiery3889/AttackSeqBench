I have this CTI outline from Symantec about a cyber attack involving the WastedLocker ransomware deployed by the group 'Evil Corp'. They used a malicious JavaScript framework called SocGholish on compromised websites to trick victims into downloading what seemed like a software update, but it was actually the start of the attack.

So, the first thing is reconnaissance. They identified targets in the U.S., mostly big corporations, including some Fortune 500 companies. That shows they were going after high-value targets.

Then, for initial access, they used this SocGholish framework. It's a JavaScript-based thing that was placed on over 150 compromised websites. So, victims would visit these sites, and they'd get this zipped file that looks like a browser update, but it's malicious JavaScript.

Once the victim runs this JavaScript, it executes another JavaScript file using wscript.exe, which profiles the computer and downloads more PowerShell scripts for discovery purposes. So, at this stage, they're gathering information about the victim's system.

Next, in the execution phase, they used PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike is a tool that attackers use for various activities like command execution, process injection, privilege escalation, and file upload/download. So, they're getting a foothold on the system and making sure they can control it.

For privilege escalation, they used a publicly documented technique involving slui.exe, which is a tool related to software licensing, and wmic.exe, which is a command-line tool for interacting with the Windows Management Instrumentation service. These tools can be used to execute commands on remote computers, which is useful for moving laterally within a network.

To evade defenses, they used PsExec to manage Windows Defender, disabling scans, removing definitions, and sometimes even turning off real-time monitoring. They also used PsExec to stop services across the organization before deploying the WastedLocker ransomware. This suggests they wanted to make sure that the ransomware could run without interference from security software or essential services.

In terms of credential access, they used Cobalt Strike along with ProcDump to dump credentials and empty log files to cover their tracks.

For lateral movement, they again used Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers, allowing them to move throughout the network.

Command and control communications were handled by the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload, which communicated with domains that were part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.

Finally, the impact was significant, with the ransomware encrypting computers and servers, causing major disruptions and leading to multimillion-dollar ransom demands.

Now, the question is: Is it likely that the attackers will deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution only before gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks and proceed to use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so let's break this down.

First, the sequence mentioned in the question is:

1. Deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution.

2. Gain initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks.

3. Use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

Now, comparing this to the CTI outline:

- Initial access was through SocGholish via compromised websites and malicious JavaScript.

- Then, they used PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike for execution.

- After that, they used various commands and tools for discovery, privilege escalation, etc.

So, in the outline, initial access happens first through SocGholish, and then they use PowerShell to deploy Cobalt Strike.

But in the question, it's suggesting that they deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell first, and then gain initial access through SocGholish.

That seems backwards compared to the outline.

In the outline, initial access is gained through SocGholish, which leads to the execution of JavaScript and then PowerShell scripts, which in turn deploy Cobalt Strike.

So, according to the outline, initial access happens before deploying Cobalt Strike, not the other way around.

Therefore, the sequence in the question appears to be inverted.

Additionally, the question mentions using commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery, which aligns with what's described in the outline during the discovery phase.

However, since the sequence of events is incorrect in the question, with Cobalt Strike being deployed before initial access, which contradicts the outline, it's unlikely that this is the correct sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the provided information.

Hence, the answer should be B: No.

It's not likely that the attackers will deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution before gaining initial access via SocGholish. According to the outline, initial access happens first through SocGholish, leading to the deployment of PowerShell and Cobalt Strike subsequently.

**Final Answer: B**
