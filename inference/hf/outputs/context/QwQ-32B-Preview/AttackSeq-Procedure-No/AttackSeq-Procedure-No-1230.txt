I have a CTI outline detailing an attack by the Lazarus group on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB). The outline breaks down the attack into several MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control. There's also some additional context about the FEIB heist and recommendations for preventing such attacks.

The question is asking whether, after establishing command and control communication using backdoor malware, the Lazarus group likely engaged in double-extortion ransomware, which involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to force victims to pay a ransom.

I need to evaluate this based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's look at what the CTI outline says about the command and control phase:

- The Lazarus group used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), which were packed with Themida to evade detection.

- These backdoors communicated with remote C&C servers.

- They expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number.

- The backdoors polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute and maintained a communication session to execute remote commands.

Now, the question is asking if, after setting up this C&C communication, the group likely engaged in double-extortion ransomware.

To answer this, I need to see if there's any indication in the CTI outline that the group exfiltrated files and then encrypted them for ransom.

Looking back at the outline:

- Under Execution, it mentions the deployment of a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) and backdoors (Samples #4 and #6).

- Under Persistence, they established automatic execution via registry keys and attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded credentials.

- Under Defense Evasion, they tried to disable antivirus processes and used packed malware to evade analysis.

- Under Lateral Movement, they copied malware to other devices on the network using SMB shares and hardcoded credentials.

- Under Command and Control, the backdoors received and executed commands from remote servers.

Nowhere in the outline is there a mention of file exfiltration or encryption, which are key components of double-extortion ransomware.

The outline focuses on establishing a foothold, maintaining persistence, evading defenses, moving laterally across the network, and maintaining command and control to execute remote commands.

There's no indication that the group exfiltrated files or encrypted them for ransom.

In fact, the background information mentions that the attack involved unauthorized transfers via the SWIFT network and arrests related to cashing out transferred funds. This suggests that the primary goal was financial fraud rather than ransomware.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it does not appear that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware activities.

So, the answer to the question is "No."

**Final Answer: B**
