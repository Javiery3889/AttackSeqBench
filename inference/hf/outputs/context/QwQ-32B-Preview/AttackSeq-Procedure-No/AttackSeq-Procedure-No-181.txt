Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the BRONZE PRESIDENT group and a question related to their tactics. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline. It's describing a cyberespionage group believed to be from the PRC that's been active since mid-2018, targeting NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia. Their phishing lures are related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics.

In terms of their operations:

- **Resource Development**: They've developed their own remote access tools and use publicly available ones like PlugX.

- **Initial Access**: They use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files to gain initial access and aim for administrator access across systems.

- **Execution**: They use various tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is widely deployed, and they use DLL side-loading for installation.

- **Persistence**: They use WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain access, creating tasks like Sysdriver to periodically execute payloads.

- **Defense Evasion**: They take steps to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution.

- **Credential Access**: They collect credentials from high-privilege accounts and extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation.

- **Discovery**: They use tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping to map the network and identify targets for lateral movement.

- **Lateral Movement**: They use Wmiexec to move laterally and execute commands on remote hosts, also using net commands with compromised credentials.

- **Collection**: They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to collect and archive files.

- **Command and Control**: Their C2 techniques vary by tool, with RCSession using a hard-coded server and Cobalt Strike using malleable C2 profiles.

- **Exfiltration**: They use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate archived data, targeting specific file types.

Additionally, there's some context that Secureworks has been monitoring them since mid-2018, with some artifacts suggesting activity as early as 2014. The group seems to have a long-term objective of monitoring target networks, and their activities suggest government sponsorship or tolerance.

Now, the question is: After employing scheduled tasks and WMI event consumers for persistence, is BRONZE PRESIDENT likely to use the tool vssadmin to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files during privilege escalation only after taking steps to minimize detection by deleting those shadow copies?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to determine if, given their tactics as described, BRONZE PRESIDENT would use vssadmin to create volume shadow copies to retrieve NTDS.dit files during privilege escalation, and then delete those shadow copies to minimize detection.

First, let's recall that NTDS.dit is the Active Directory database file, which contains user account information, including password hashes. Extracting this file is a common step in privilege escalation to obtain domain credentials.

Volume shadow copies are snapshots of files and folders at a specific point in time, which can be used to retrieve previous versions of files. Attackers sometimes create shadow copies to access previous versions of files that might have been altered or to access files that are in use.

In the CTI outline, it's mentioned that BRONZE PRESIDENT collects credentials from high-privilege network accounts and extracts password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation. So, it's clear they are interested in obtaining this file.

Moreover, the outline states that they take steps to minimize detection, including deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution.

So, putting two and two together: If they are interested in extracting NTDS.dit and they delete volume shadow copies to minimize detection, it's plausible that they might create volume shadow copies to access the file and then delete them afterward.

However, I need to think carefully about this. Creating volume shadow copies might not be the most straightforward way to access NTDS.dit. Typically, an attacker with sufficient privileges can copy the file directly from the file system, especially if they have already obtained administrative access.

But, there might be scenarios where the file is in use or locked, making it necessary to access a shadow copy to retrieve it. In such cases, creating a shadow copy could be a useful technique.

Moreover, since they are already deleting volume shadow copies to minimize detection, it suggests that they are aware of the potential forensic value of these copies and want to cover their tracks.

So, considering that they need to access NTDS.dit, might face obstacles in directly copying it, and are already deleting shadow copies for stealth, using vssadmin to create shadow copies and then delete them after retrieving the file makes strategic sense.

Therefore, it seems likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT would employ this tactic as part of their privilege escalation activities.

Looking back at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

Based on the analysis, I think A: Yes is the most plausible answer.

**Final Answer: A**
