Alright, I've got this CTI outline about the BRONZE PRESIDENT group and a question related to their tactics. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. So, starting with Reconnaissance, it says that this group targets NGOs, political and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia since mid-2018. They use phishing lures related to national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement topics. So, they're doing their homework to tailor their attacks to specific interests of their targets.

Next is Resource Development. They've developed their own remote access tools and also use publicly available tools. Their infrastructure is linked to entities within the PRC and PRC-based ISPs. Tools like PlugX, which is historically used by PRC-based groups, are part of their arsenal. So, they have the resources and the tools to carry out their operations.

Initial Access: They likely use phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files as the initial access vector. They gain administrator access to all systems within a targeted business unit and install remote access tools on a significant number of hosts. So, they start with phishing and quickly escalate privileges to get a foothold in the network.

Execution: They use various tools for execution, including Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. Cobalt Strike is installed on over 70% of accessible hosts in some intrusions, and RCSession is installed via DLL side-loading. So, they have multiple ways to execute their malicious activities.

Persistence: They use WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks to maintain persistence. They create tasks like the Sysdriver scheduled task to periodically execute payloads. So, they ensure they can maintain access over time.

Privilege Escalation: After compromising the network, they elevate privileges and install malware on a large proportion of systems. They use native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files containing password hashes. So, they go deep into the network to get high-level access.

Defense Evasion: They take steps to minimize detection, like deleting volume shadow copies after use and killing processes post-execution. They install malware on many hosts but exercise restraint to avoid detection. So, they're careful not to raise alarms.

Credential Access: They collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts. They also extract password hashes from NTDS.dit files for offline exploitation. So, they're after valuable credentials.

Discovery: They use tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands to understand the network environment and identify opportunities for lateral movement. So, they map out the network to know where to go next.

Lateral Movement: They leverage Wmiexec extensively to move laterally and execute WMI commands on remote hosts. They also use net commands to connect to other hosts using compromised credentials. So, they move around the network to spread their access.

Collection: They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to collate identified files into archives. They use scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations. So, they're gathering specific files based on file types.

Exfiltration: They use tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate archived data. They target specific data types and use custom batch scripts to create lists of files with predefined criteria for exfiltration. So, they package the data and send it out.

Now, the question is: After using scripts named after various file extensions to collect files from specific locations during the Collection phase, is it likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will have ORat use a raw socket protocol for Command and Control communication only before the Collection phase?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Okay, so I need to think about the sequence of tactics here. The question is asking about the use of ORat with a raw socket protocol for C2 communication, specifically whether this happens only before the Collection phase.

First, let's recall that ORat is one of the tools they use for execution, along with Cobalt Strike, PlugX, and RCSession. The outline mentions that they use Cobalt Strike and RCSession for exfiltration, but it doesn't specify about ORat.

So, the question is about the timing of ORat's use of raw socket protocol for C2 communication in relation to the Collection phase.

Let's think about the sequence:

1. They start with Reconnaissance and Resource Development.

2. Then Initial Access through phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files.

3. Execution: They use various tools, including ORat.

4. Persistence: They set up WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks.

5. Privilege Escalation: They elevate privileges and install malware.

6. Defense Evasion: They take steps to avoid detection.

7. Credential Access: They collect credentials and password hashes.

8. Discovery: They map the network.

9. Lateral Movement: They move laterally using Wmiexec and net commands.

10. Collection: They collect specific files using custom scripts.

11. Exfiltration: They exfiltrate the collected data using RCSession and Cobalt Strike.

So, the Collection phase comes after they have already established a presence in the network, escalated privileges, and mapped the environment.

Now, the question is about ORat using a raw socket protocol for C2 communication, and whether this happens only before the Collection phase.

First, I need to understand what a raw socket protocol for C2 means. Raw sockets allow for more control over network packets, which can be used for stealthier communication to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.

Given that BRONZE PRESIDENT is careful about evasion, it's plausible that they would use raw sockets for C2 to be less detectable.

But the question is about the timing: whether ORat uses raw sockets only before the Collection phase.

Looking back at the sequence, ORat is used during the Execution phase, which is early in the attack chain, before Collection.

However, the outline doesn't specify if ORat is used throughout the entire attack or just in the beginning.

But, since they use multiple tools, it's possible that different tools are used at different stages.

Cobalt Strike is widely used and installed on many hosts, so it might be used throughout the attack.

RCSession is used for exfiltration, so it's used towards the end.

ORat might be used earlier on.

But the question is about ORat using raw sockets for C2, specifically before the Collection phase.

So, perhaps ORat is used early on for initial C2 communication, and then other tools are used for later stages, including Collection and Exfiltration.

If that's the case, then using raw sockets for C2 with ORat before Collection makes sense, as a stealthy way to communicate during the initial stages.

But the question is whether this is likely to happen only before the Collection phase.

Given that Collection is a later stage, and assuming ORat is used earlier, then yes, using raw sockets with ORat would be before Collection.

But, if ORat is used throughout the attack, then it might be used during or after Collection as well.

However, the outline doesn't specify the timeline for ORat's usage.

So, based on the information provided, it's not entirely clear whether ORat is only used before Collection or throughout the attack.

But, considering that they have multiple tools and likely use different ones for different stages, it's possible that ORat is used early on, and other tools are used for later stages.

Therefore, it's plausible that ORat uses raw sockets for C2 only before the Collection phase.

But, to be thorough, I need to consider if there's any indication that ORat is used during or after Collection.

The outline mentions that Cobalt Strike and RCSession are used for exfiltration, but doesn't specify about ORat.

So, perhaps ORat is mainly used earlier in the attack chain.

Hence, it's likely that ORat uses raw sockets for C2 only before the Collection phase.

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.

But, to make sure, let's consider the alternative.

If ORat is used throughout the attack, including during Collection, then using raw sockets for C2 wouldn't be only before Collection.

But, given that Cobalt Strike and RCSession are specified for exfiltration, it's possible that ORat is used earlier on.

Moreover, using raw sockets for C2 is a technique that might be more useful early in the attack when trying to establish and maintain a stealthy connection.

Once the attackers have a firm foothold and have collected the data, they might switch to other tools for exfiltration.

Therefore, it makes sense that ORat with raw sockets is used before Collection.

Hence, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
