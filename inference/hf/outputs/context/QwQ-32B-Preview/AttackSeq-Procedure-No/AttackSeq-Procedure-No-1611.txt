I have a CTI outline that describes a cyber attack attributed to the Cosmic Banker malware, which targets users of Mexican banking institutions. The attack is part of a campaign that has been ongoing since March 2019 and is linked to similar activities targeting Brazilian banking institutions. The malware is associated with the Banload malware and is believed to be operated by Brazilian attackers.

The attack begins with a phishing email that impersonates Mexico's tax department, SAT, warning recipients about a pending tax return. The email contains a zip file with a malicious batch file and a folder containing a legitimate executable and another batch file. When either batch file is executed, it triggers a PowerShell script that downloads additional malware components and establishes persistence on the victim's system.

The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook to collect email contacts and exfiltrates this data back to the attackers. It communicates with specific domains for command and control purposes.

The question is: After accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts, is the Cosmic Banker malware likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying text related to an alleged data update request only before executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level and enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks?

Answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

To answer this, I need to analyze the sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) described in the question and see if they align with the attack sequence outlined in the CTI report.

First, let's break down the question:

1. After accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts,

2. Is the Cosmic Banker malware likely to target Mexican financial institution users

3. To steal credentials by displaying text related to an alleged data update request

4. Only before executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level

5. And enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

Now, let's look at the CTI outline to see if these steps are accurately represented.

1. **Accessing Outlook information to collect email accounts:**

   - The outline states that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

   - This matches point 1 in the question.

2. **Targeting Mexican financial institution users:**

   - The outline mentions that the campaign targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.

   - This matches point 2 in the question.

3. **Stealing credentials by displaying text related to an alleged data update request:**

   - The outline describes the initial access vector as a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department, warning of a pending tax return.

   - It doesn't specify if there's a display of text related to an alleged data update request during the credential stealing process.

   - The phishing email is the initial access vector, but the question seems to suggest that such text is displayed during the credential stealing phase.

   - This is unclear from the outline.

4. **Executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level:**

   - The outline describes that the batch file executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level, which downloads the main malware components.

   - This matches point 4 in the question.

5. **Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks:**

   - The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

   - This matches point 5 in the question.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question seems mostly accurate, except for point 3, which mentions displaying text related to an alleged data update request during credential stealing. The outline doesn't specify this detail.

However, the question asks if, after collecting email accounts from Outlook, the malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying such text only before executing the batch file and enabling persistence.

Considering that the initial access vector is a phishing email about a pending tax return, it's possible that during the credential stealing phase, the malware might display some sort of request related to data update to trick users into entering their credentials.

But since the outline doesn't explicitly mention this step, we have to rely on the plausibility based on common attack patterns.

In many credential stealing attacks, especially those targeting financial institutions, attackers often display fake update requests or other social engineering ploys to trick users into entering their credentials.

Therefore, it's plausible that this malware includes such a step, even if it's not explicitly mentioned in the outline.

Given that, the sequence described in the question seems reasonable and aligns with the known stages of the attack as per the CTI outline.

Hence, the answer is likely "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
