Alright, I have this CTI outline about FIN13, a cyber threat group that's been active since 2016, mainly targeting organizations in Mexico, particularly in finance, retail, and hospitality. They're known for long-term intrusions, mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents to facilitate fraudulent money transfers. Unlike typical ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools to stay in the network for extended periods.

So, the question is about their sequence of actions after moving laterally in the network. It says that after using WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, is it likely that they will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like dumping LSASS process memory and using trojanized KeePass binaries.

I need to choose between "Yes" and "No" based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events here. The question is asking if, after lateral movement, they will perform system service discovery only after getting credentials through specific methods.

Let's break this down.

From the outline:

- **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally. They also use custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.

- **Privilege Escalation:** They use common privilege escalation techniques, including dumping LSASS process memory using tools like ProcDump and extracting credentials with Mimikatz. They also trojanize KeePass binaries to log passwords.

- **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors and other tactics to avoid detection.

- **Credential Access:** They use process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials. They target unsecured credentials and use trojanized KeePass to log passwords.

- **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely.

So, the sequence seems to be:

1. **Initial Access:** Exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.

2. **Execution:** Use JSPRAT and other tools for command execution and file operations.

3. **Persistence:** Use various methods like replacing KeePass binaries and deploying malware.

4. **Privilege Escalation:** Use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to escalate privileges.

5. **Defense Evasion:** Use passive backdoors and other tactics to avoid detection.

6. **Credential Access:** Dump LSASS, use trojanized KeePass, etc., to get credentials.

7. **Lateral Movement:** Use WMI and custom web shells to move laterally.

8. **Collection:** Collect data from network shares and stage it.

9. **Command and Control:** Use various methods to communicate with compromised systems.

10. **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate data over web services using tools like web shells.

Now, the question is focusing on what happens after lateral movement. It's asking if, after moving laterally using WMI and custom web shells, they will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via specific methods like dumping LSASS and using trojanized KeePass.

So, in the sequence above, lateral movement is step 7, and credential access is step 6. But in the question, it's after lateral movement, so perhaps they perform credential access again after moving to new systems.

Let me think about this.

When they move laterally to a new system, they might need to gather credentials again on that new system to further move later or to access certain resources.

So, after lateral movement, they might perform credential access on the new system, and then use those credentials to perform system service discovery.

But the question is a bit tricky because it says "only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries."

So, is it likely that they will perform system service discovery only after obtaining credentials using those specific techniques?

Well, from the outline, they do use those techniques for credential access, but it's not specified that they always perform system service discovery only after using those techniques.

Moreover, system service discovery could be part of the initial reconnaissance or part of the lateral movement process itself, not necessarily dependent on obtaining credentials in a specific way.

Also, they might use other methods to discover services without necessarily dumping LSASS or using trojanized KeePass.

So, considering that, I think the answer is "No," it's not likely that they will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via those specific techniques.

They might perform service discovery as part of their lateral movement or other activities without necessarily going through that specific credential access step.

Therefore, the answer is B: No.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
