Alright, I have this CTI outline from ESET about a campaign by Mustang Panda using a new Korplug variant called Hodur. The campaign has been active since August 2021 and targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using phishing documents related to current events like Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence based on the MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline. The outline covers several tactics:

1. **Resource Development**: This is where the group develops their tools and infrastructure.

2. **Initial Access**: Believed to involve phishing and watering hole attacks, using filenames related to current events.

3. **Execution**: Uses a custom loader to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting side-loading vulnerabilities.

4. **Persistence**: Establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.

5. **Discovery**: Collects system information like uptime, Windows version, CPU, RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and current system time.

6. **Collection**: Collects data from local systems, removable media, and network shared drives, including files, directories, metadata, and content.

7. **Command and Control**: Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, encrypted with RC4, and can use non-standard ports.

8. **Exfiltration**: Exfiltrates data via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

Additionally, there's information about the group's tactics, such as using decoy documents and iteratively improving their tools.

Now, the question is: After Mustang Panda delivers a downloader with filenames linked to current events to open a decoy document and gain initial access, is it likely that the group will deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion?

Answer choices are:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to determine whether it's likely that Mustang Panda would deploy a UEFI rootkit (LoJax) before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion, based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

First, let's break down the question:

- **Initial Access**: Delivered via a downloader with filenames related to current events, opening a decoy document.

- **Next Steps**: Deploy LoJax (a UEFI rootkit) before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

I need to assess if this sequence is plausible based on the outline.

Looking back at the outline:

- **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.

- **Execution**: Custom loader exploits side-loading vulnerability to execute Korplug variant.

- **Persistence**: Creates a hidden directory and sets up persistence via scheduled task or registry entry.

- **Defense Evasion**: Uses anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage.

Now, LoJax is a UEFI rootkit that was previously associated with another group called Sednit (also known as APT28, Sofacy, or Strontium), not directly with Mustang Panda. However, it's possible that Mustang Panda has adopted similar techniques.

But according to the outline, Mustang Panda is using a custom loader to deploy Korplug, and they employ control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion. There's no mention of UEFI rootkits or LoJax specifically in this campaign.

Given that, is it likely that Mustang Panda would deploy LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation?

Well, UEFI rootkits are a sophisticated persistence mechanism, allowing attackers to maintain access even through OS re-installs. Control-flow obfuscation is a technique used to make reverse engineering difficult, part of defense evasion.

In terms of sequence:

1. Initial access is gained through phishing with decoy documents.

2. The custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.

3. Persistence is established via scheduled tasks or registry entries.

4. Defense evasion techniques, including control-flow obfuscation, are applied throughout.

Given this, deploying a UEFI rootkit like LoJax would be an additional step for persistence, beyond what's already described in the outline.

However, the question asks specifically about whether it's likely that Mustang Panda will deploy LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation.

Considering that:

- LoJax is a sophisticated persistence mechanism.

- Control-flow obfuscation is a defense evasion technique applied throughout the attack.

It's possible that establishing persistence (including with a UEFI rootkit) could occur before or alongside defense evasion measures.

But here's the thing: the CTI outline doesn't mention LoJax or any UEFI rootkit being used in this particular campaign. It only mentions the use of a custom loader, side-loading vulnerabilities, and standard persistence mechanisms like scheduled tasks and registry entries.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it's not supported that Mustang Panda is deploying LoJax in this campaign.

Moreover, LoJax is typically associated with Sednit, not Mustang Panda. While it's possible that Mustang Panda has adopted similar techniques, there's no indication of that in the provided outline.

Hence, it's unlikely that Mustang Panda would deploy LoJax in this specific campaign, given the available information.

Therefore, the answer should be:

B: No

It's not likely that Mustang Panda will deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion, based on the provided CTI outline.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{B} \]
