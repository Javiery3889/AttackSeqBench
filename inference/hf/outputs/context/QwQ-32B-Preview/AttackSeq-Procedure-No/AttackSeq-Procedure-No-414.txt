To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the provided CTI outline and see if it supports the sequence of tactics described in the question. The question is asking whether, after the discovery phase, UNC1945 will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP in the lateral movement phase.

First, let's break down the CTI outline to understand the attack sequence based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

**Initial Access:**

- In late 2018: Exploited a vulnerability in an internet-exposed Solaris server's SSH service to install the SLAPSTICK backdoor for credential capture.

- In mid-2020: Deployed the EVILSUN tool containing a zero-day exploit for CVE-2020-14871 on a Solaris 9 server for remote exploitation without authentication.

**Execution:**

- Used custom virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools for command execution, file transfer, and tunnel connections.

- Employed a custom Linux backdoor named LEMONSTICK for command execution and file transfer.

**Persistence:**

- Established persistence on a Solaris 9 server using the SLAPSTICK backdoor with a secret hard-coded password.

- Placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder to maintain access.

**Privilege Escalation:**

- Escalated privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and open-source tools like Mimikatz.

- Installed three backdoors (SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO) on various endpoints after privilege escalation.

**Defense Evasion:**

- Employed anti-forensics techniques using a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH to clean logs and built-in Linux commands to alter timestamps.

- Executed a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI in memory to obfuscate activity.

**Credential Access:**

- Collected credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz.

- Enabled lateral movement throughout networks and access to other network segments and third-party environments.

**Discovery:**

- Maintained various tools for internal reconnaissance, including network scanners, exploits, and reconnaissance tools contained within their custom virtual machines.

- Employed a SPARC executable identified as a reconnaissance tool, possibly referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep.

**Command and Control:**

- Used SSH Port Forwarding to maintain access to their external infrastructure.

- Deployed a custom QEMU Virtual Machine on multiple hosts for direct access to the command and control server, obfuscating interaction with customer infrastructure.

**Others:**

- Mandiant did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions investigated.

- In at least one case, ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment was observed in the final phase of threat actor activity, but not attributed to UNC1945.

- It is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to another group.

Now, looking at the question:

"After leveraging reconnaissance tools within their custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation during the Discovery phase, will UNC1945 abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP in the Lateral Movement phase?"

The question is asking about a specific sequence of tactics:

1. **Discovery phase:** Using reconnaissance tools within custom virtual machines for internal scanning and network exploitation.

2. **Abuse OAuth access tokens:** To gain access to target email accounts.

3. **Lateral Movement phase:** Moving to a Windows server via RDP.

First, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions anything about OAuth access tokens or accessing email accounts.

Looking through the outline:

- **Initial Access:** mentions exploiting SSH services on Solaris servers and using a zero-day exploit for CVE-2020-14871.

- **Execution:** uses custom virtual machines and backdoors for command execution and file transfer.

- **Persistence:** establishes persistence using backdoors and modifying system files.

- **Privilege Escalation:** uses backdoors and tools like Mimikatz for privilege escalation.

- **Defense Evasion:** employs anti-forensics techniques and in-memory packers.

- **Credential Access:** collects credentials using backdoors and Mimikatz.

- **Discovery:** uses various reconnaissance tools within custom virtual machines.

- **Command and Control:** uses SSH Port Forwarding and custom virtual machines for C2 communication.

- **Others:** no data exfiltration observed, possible sale of access to another group.

Nowhere in the outline is there a mention of OAuth access tokens or accessing email accounts. The credential access mentioned is through backdoors and Mimikatz, which typically collect credentials stored in memory or on the system, but not specifically OAuth tokens for email accounts.

Moreover, the lateral movement mentioned is via RDP, as indicated in the question, but there's no indication that this is preceded by abusing OAuth tokens for email accounts.

Given that the CTI outline does not provide any information about UNC1945 using OAuth tokens or accessing email accounts, it's unlikely that they abuse OAuth access tokens in the sequence described.

Therefore, the answer is "No," UNC1945 will not abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP in the lateral movement phase, based on the provided CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B**
