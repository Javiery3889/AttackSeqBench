 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occur between the Explosive Trojan gaining access to administrator passwords (Credential Access) and the use of a Command and Control framework (Command and Control).

From the CTI outline, we can see that after gaining access to administrator passwords, the attackers do not use T1091-Replication Through Removable Media, T1071-Application Layer Protocol, or T1134.004-Parent PID Spoofing in the sequence provided.

However, the outline does mention that the attackers further penetrate the targeted internal network via various means, including manual online hacking. This action can be associated with T1021-Remote Services, as it involves exploiting remote services to gain access to a system.

So, the most plausible sequence of TTPs between the Explosive Trojan gaining access to administrator passwords and the use of a Command and Control framework would be:

1. Credential Access (T1087)
2. T1021-Remote Services

Final Answer: T1021-Remote Services.
