 Final Answer: C: T1571-Non-Standard Port

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: T1192-Phishing: Email Attachment
   - Execution: T1055-Command and Scripting Interpreter
   - Credential Access: T1003-Credential Dumping
   - Lateral Movement: T1021-Remote Desktop Protocol
   - Collection: T1005-Data from Local System
   - Exfiltration: T1041-Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel
   - Others: The PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan used an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80 to contact a C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred when the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan established communications with a C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan contacted a C&C server using an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80. This is not a standard port for most services, so T1571-Non-Standard Port is the most plausible answer.

4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the communication between the PoisonIvy backdoor Trojan and the C&C server:
   - T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness: This technique involves modifying the permissions of services in the registry, which is not directly related to the communication between the Trojan and the C&C server.
   - T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple stages to deliver a payload, which is not directly related to the communication between the Trojan and the C&C server.
   - T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material: This technique involves using alternate authentication material, such as tokens or certificates, which is not directly related to the communication between the Trojan and the C&C server.
