 Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Volatile Cedar conducts vulnerability scans to identify exploitable web servers.
   - Execution: The Explosive Trojan is used for remote execution through dynamically loaded DLL components.
   - Persistence: Explosive Trojan spreads to various locations on the infected server.
   - Defense Evasion: Explosive Trojan hides from detection tools and avoids AV detections.
   - Credential Access: Explosive Trojan gains access to administrator passwords.
   - Lateral Movement: Volatile Cedar uses the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network.
   - Command and Control: Volatile Cedar uses a multi-tiered server backend framework for control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after the initial exploitation of the web server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after the initial exploitation of the web server, the Explosive Trojan is used for remote execution, and lateral movement is observed.
   - Answer choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services aligns best with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, as it refers to the exploitation of a remote service, which is followed by lateral movement in the CTI outline.
   - Answer choices B, C, and D do not directly relate to the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline. T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application refers to exploiting publicly accessible applications, T1480.001-Environmental Keying involves using environmental information in the attack, and T1091-Replication Through Removable Media involves spreading malware through removable media, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline as a method of lateral movement.

Therefore, the final answer is A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
