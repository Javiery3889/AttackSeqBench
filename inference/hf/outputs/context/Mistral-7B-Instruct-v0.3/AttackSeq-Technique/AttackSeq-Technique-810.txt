 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that occurred after exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers established command and control servers to communicate with the compromised systems. This action is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071 - "Command and Control (C2)".

However, the question asks for a technique that occurred to avoid detection while establishing a backdoor connection to command and control servers. The CTI outline does not provide specific details about techniques used to avoid detection during the command and control phase.

Given the limited information provided, it is challenging to definitively answer the question. However, one possible answer could be T1036 - "Masquerading", as it involves disguising the identity of the attacker or the attacker's actions to blend in with normal system activity. This technique could potentially help the attackers avoid detection while establishing a backdoor connection to command and control servers.

Final Answer: T1036 - Masquerading (although this answer is speculative due to the lack of specific information about the avoidance of detection during the command and control phase in the CTI outline).
