 Final Answer: A: T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing email with malicious RTF or Microsoft Excel documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, and CVE-2018-0802.
   - Initial Access > Initial Foothold > Command and Control > T1105 - Command and Control (C2) beaconing to establish a connection with the attacker's server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After exploiting known vulnerabilities through malicious documents, the question asks about concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication.
   - Command and Control > T1132 - Obfuscated Communications > T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding is a technique used to conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers establish a connection with the C2 server after exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - The question asks about concealing the identity of the C2 server during communication.
   - Answer choice A, T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding, aligns best with the attack sequence and the question's context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access to the victim's system (Initial Access).
   - After gaining access, they establish a connection with the C2 server (Initial Foothold > Command and Control).
   - To conceal the identity of the C2 server during communication, the attackers use non-standard encoding (T1132.002 - Non-Standard Encoding).
