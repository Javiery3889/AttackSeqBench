 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that Shuckworm used to execute the malicious document containing the custom backdoor Pterodo. According to the CTI outline, the initial access was gained by opening a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email. The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

The MITRE ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before Shuckworm used mshta.exe for bypassing application control solutions and browser security settings is T1192 - Exploit Public-Facing Application. This technique involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a publicly-facing application to gain unauthorized access. In this case, the malicious document likely exploited a vulnerability to execute the Pterodo backdoor.

Final Answer: T1192 - Exploit Public-Facing Application.
