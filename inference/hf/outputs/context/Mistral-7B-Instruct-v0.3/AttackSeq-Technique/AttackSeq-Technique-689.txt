 Final Answer: B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Social engineering, email attachments, Microsoft Word documents, executables.
   - Execution: Malicious documents download and execute Pierogi backdoor.
   - Defense Evasion: Pierogi backdoor checks for antivirus and evades detection.
   - Discovery: Backdoor collects information about the infected machine.
   - Collection: Backdoor takes screenshots and executes arbitrary commands.
   - Command and Control: Backdoor communicates with C2 servers.
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration through web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about a technique that ensures the Pierogi backdoor would run upon user login.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Pierogi backdoor is downloaded and executed upon opening the malicious Microsoft Word documents. However, the question asks about a technique that ensures the backdoor would run upon user login.
   - T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is a technique that involves setting up the malware to run automatically during the boot process or upon user login. This technique would ensure that the backdoor runs upon user login, as the question asks.
   - T1505.005-Terminal Services DLL, T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service, and T1098.005-Device Registration are not related to ensuring the backdoor runs upon user login.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
