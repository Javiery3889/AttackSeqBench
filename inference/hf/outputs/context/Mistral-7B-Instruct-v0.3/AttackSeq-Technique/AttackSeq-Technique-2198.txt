 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that leads to the dumping of the lsass process memory using procdump. The TTPs mentioned in the question are:

1. Deploying containers
2. Obfuscation techniques to conceal activities
3. Dumping the memory of the lsass process using procdump to obtain credential hashes

From the CTI outline, we can see that Earth Lusca used containers in the Execution phase and obfuscation techniques in the Command and Control phase. However, the credential access phase is where they dumped the memory of the lsass process.

So, the most likely sequence of TTPs would be:

1. Deploying containers (Execution phase)
2. Obfuscation techniques (Command and Control phase)
3. Credential Access (Dumping the memory of the lsass process using procdump)

Therefore, the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the group dumped the memory of the lsass process is:

Final Answer: T1548-Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (Credential Access phase)
