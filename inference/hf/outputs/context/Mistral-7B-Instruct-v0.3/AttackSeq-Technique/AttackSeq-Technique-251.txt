 To answer this question, we need to identify the TTPs that occurred between exploiting CVE-2018-0798 and establishing persistence via scheduled tasks.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access was achieved by exploiting CVE-2018-0798 to execute 'OSEA54d.tmp'. After that, the attackers used Defense Evasion techniques to disguise their activities. The Defense Evasion technique used was T1036 - Masquerading, as they used a legitimate Microsoft utility, CertUtil.exe, disguised as 'GoogleUpdate.exe' to download additional payloads.

Therefore, the most likely TTP that occurred before persistence was established via scheduled tasks running 'msiexec' and 'Photo.vbs' is T1036 - Masquerading.

Final Answer: T1036 - Masquerading.
