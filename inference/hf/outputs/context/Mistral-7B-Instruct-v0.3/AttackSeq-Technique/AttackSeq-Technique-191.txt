 Final Answer: A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Infamous Chisel collects files from the local system and application directories (Collection).
   - Command and Control: Infamous Chisel provides SCP functionality and deploys td with a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to SSH program (Command and Control).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Infamous Chisel collects files from the local system and application directories (Collection) and uses SSH connections and a Tor hidden service for Command and Control.
   - The answer choices all mention Automated Exfiltration (T1020), which is the technique used to transfer data from the compromised system to an unauthorized location.
   - The other answer choices do not align with the context of exfiltrating collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration.
