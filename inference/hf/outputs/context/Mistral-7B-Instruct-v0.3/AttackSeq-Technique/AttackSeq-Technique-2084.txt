 Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and delivers exploits through malvertising or compromised websites.
   - Initial Access: RIG EK uses Drive-by Compromise technique to deliver exploits.
   - Execution: RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used by RIG EK to securely transmit exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm as part of its Command and Control tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we know that RIG EK fetches malware from the C&C infrastructure using an obfuscated PowerShell script during the Execution phase. Since the question asks about the Command and Control tactic, it is reasonable to assume that the transmission of the malware from the C&C infrastructure to the victim machine is part of the Command and Control tactic.
   - The answer choices A, T1573-Encrypted Channel, and D, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy, both relate to secure transmission of data. However, T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy is about using multiple proxy servers to mask the origin of the traffic, not encrypting the data. On the other hand, T1573-Encrypted Channel is about using encrypted communication channels, which aligns with the context that the malware is encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.
   - The other answer choices B, T1205-Traffic Signaling, and C, T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, do not seem to be directly related to the secure transmission of encrypted data.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: T1573-Encrypted Channel.
