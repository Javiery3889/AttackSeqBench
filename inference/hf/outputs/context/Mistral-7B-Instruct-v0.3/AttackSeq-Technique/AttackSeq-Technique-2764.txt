 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occur between configuring a Listener in Cobalt Strike and the reflective DLL injection of beacon.dll.

From the CTI outline, we know that the Listener is configured to communicate with the C2 server, and then the C2 server responds with the beacon.dll. The technique that occurs between these two events is the method used for the communication between the Listener and the C2 server.

In this case, the communication happens at the Application Layer Protocol (T1071). The C2 server responds with an HTTP 200 OK, which is an application layer response. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

Final Answer: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
