 Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Exfiltration are the MITRE ATT&CK tactics present in the CTI outline.
   - The outline mentions a proxy tool (svehost.exe) used for defense evasion, which suggests the use of an encrypted channel for communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitated APT28's secure communication with their C&C servers after deploying the backdoor component.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The outline mentions a proxy tool (svehost.exe) used for defense evasion, which is a technique to contact systems behind routers, which would otherwise not be accessible from outside the network. This implies the use of an encrypted channel for communication, as the proxy tool would need to securely communicate with the C&C server.
   - T1569-System Services, T1071.001-Web Protocols, and T1218.014-MMC do not directly relate to secure communication with C&C servers.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is the technique that best aligns with the attack sequence and the contextual information about the proxy tool.
