 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that would lead to remote network access before the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

From the CTI outline, we can see that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials (Credential Access) and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access. This sequence of TTPs aligns with T1078 - Credential Access.

So, the most likely answer to the question is:

Final Answer: C: T1078-Valid Accounts (as it includes the use of stolen credentials for remote access)
