 Final Answer: C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and drops a malicious DLL (ActiveUpdate.dll) and shellcode file (Active.dat). It copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe, executes the new file with the path to the DLL, and installs itself for automatic startup.
   - Persistence: The PIVY variant installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
   - Defense Evasion: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL and perform its malicious actions.
   - Command and Control: The PIVY samples communicate with C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred when the PIVY variant executed a copied version of rundll32.exe with the path to the malicious DLL.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the PIVY variant copies rundll32.exe and executes it with the path to the malicious DLL (ActiveUpdate.dll). This action is a form of command and scripting interpreter (T1059).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PIVY variant copies rundll32.exe and executes it with the path to the malicious DLL (ActiveUpdate.dll). This action is a form of command and scripting interpreter (T1059). Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred when the PIVY variant executed a copied version of rundll32.exe with the path to the malicious DLL is T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter.
