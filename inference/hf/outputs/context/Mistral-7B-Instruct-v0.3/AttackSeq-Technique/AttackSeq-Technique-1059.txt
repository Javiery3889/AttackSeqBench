 Final Answer: A: T1583-Acquire Infrastructure

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Darkhotel APT conducts reconnaissance to identify their targets' whereabouts, gains initial access by distributing malware, deploys malware components, maintains persistence, uses digital certificates for their backdoors, collects credentials, and manages victims through a web interface.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled the Darkhotel APT to conduct large-scale cryptographic operations and utilize Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps for their infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The technique T1583-Acquire Infrastructure involves the adversary acquiring and maintaining infrastructure to support their operations. This includes web servers, domain names, and other resources. The Darkhotel APT uses a web interface for victim management, which suggests they have acquired and maintained infrastructure to support their operations. Additionally, the use of Apache webservers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps in the question can be inferred from the CTI outline, as the Darkhotel APT uses digital certificates to sign their backdoors, which could be hosted on web servers, and they employ techniques to encrypt and store data, which could be done using PHP scripts.

4. The technique T1056-Input Capture is about capturing keystrokes or other input from an intended target, which does not seem to be directly related to the large-scale cryptographic operations and infrastructure setup mentioned in the question. T1584.008-Network Devices is about exploiting or manipulating network devices, which is not directly related to the use of web servers, dynamic DNS, and PHP webapps. SEO Poisoning (T1608.006) is about manipulating search engine results to direct users to malicious sites, which is not directly related to the infrastructure setup and large-scale cryptographic operations. Therefore, T1583-Acquire Infrastructure is the most plausible answer.
