 Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious delivery documents are used to trick victims into enabling macros and activating the payload.
   - Execution: The payload creates two files in the ProgramData directory, one of which is a .VBS script that executes a PowerShell script.
   - Persistence: The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: The PowerShell script employs obfuscation and uses publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.
   - Discovery: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - Collection: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots before sending this data to a C&C server.
   - Others: The attackers monitor incoming connections to the C&C server and have a personalized message for improper requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about a technique that occurs after the backdoor collects machine information and screenshots to send data to the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions communication by querying external services and transmitting encrypted messages. In the CTI outline, the backdoor function collects data and sends it to a C&C server, which implies communication with an external service. Since the data is encrypted, it is likely that the communication is done over a secure channel.
   - Answer choice A: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application does not involve communication with an external service or encryption.
   - Answer choice B: T1039-Data from Network Shared Drive does not involve communication with an external service or encryption.
   - Answer choice D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer does not involve communication with an external service or encryption.
   - Answer choice C: T1102-Web Service involves communication with an external service (the C&C server) and encryption (as the data is sent securely).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is C: T1102-Web Service.
