 Final Answer: C: T1566-Phishing

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: T1566 (Phishing) -> T1087 (Credential Access) -> T1055 (Command and Control) -> T1041 (Persistence) -> T1083 (Initial Access) -> T1084 (Lateral Movement) -> T1078 (Network Management: Exfiltration)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after HIDDEN COBRA used spearphishing attacks (T1566) to gain credentials for accessing retail staff passwords and before inserting malicious scripts into store checkout pages for intercepting transactions.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions that HIDDEN COBRA used spearphishing attacks (T1566) to gain credentials, which is the initial step in the attack sequence from the CTI outline. The question also mentions that the next step is inserting malicious scripts into store checkout pages (T1055), which is later in the sequence. Therefore, we need to find a technique that occurs after T1566 and before T1055.
   - The answer choices do not directly mention T1055, but we can infer that T1091 (Replication Through Removable Media) and T1205 (Traffic Signaling) are not likely to be used in this context, as they do not involve the manipulation of web pages or data interception. T1098.007 (Additional Local or Domain Groups) is also not directly related to the sequence, as it involves adding users to groups, not manipulating web pages or data interception.
   - The only remaining answer, T1566 (Phishing), is the technique that most likely occurred after T1566 (spearphishing attacks) and before T1055 (inserting malicious scripts).

Therefore, the final answer is C: T1566-Phishing.
