 Final Answer: B: T1119-Automated Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: SkinnyBoy executes, creates processes, and communicates with the C2 server.
   - Defense Evasion: SkinnyBoy uses various APIs to evade detection.
   - Discovery: SkinnyBoy enumerates directories and system information.
   - Command and Control: SkinnyBoy communicates with the C2 server and downloads a DLL.
   - Exfiltration: SkinnyBoy exfiltrates data to the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely to occur as the next step to process and gather data for the exfiltration phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery technique is used to gather information, but it doesn't directly process or gather data for the exfiltration phase.
   - T1119-Automated Collection involves the use of scripts or automated tools to collect data, which aligns with the malware's behavior of enumerating directories and system information, as it could be preparing the data for exfiltration.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts, T1025-Data from Removable Media, and T1218.012-Verclsid are not directly related to the processing and gathering of data for the exfiltration phase based on the provided CTI outline.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be Discovery (T1087) -> Automated Collection (T1119) -> Command and Control (T1071) -> Exfiltration (T1041). However, the question asks for the technique most likely to occur as the next step to process and gather data for the exfiltration phase, so the answer is T1119-Automated Collection.
