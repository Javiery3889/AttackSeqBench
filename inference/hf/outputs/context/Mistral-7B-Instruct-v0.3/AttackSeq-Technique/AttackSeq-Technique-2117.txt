 Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attackers initially gained access to the target network via SSL-VPN (Discovery).
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the technique most likely used for gaining access to the target network.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used SSL-VPN for initial access, which aligns with T1133-External Remote Services. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the initial access method used in this scenario. T1129-Shared Modules, T1611-Escape to Host, and T1195-Supply Chain Compromise do not seem to be relevant to the initial access phase described in the CTI outline.
