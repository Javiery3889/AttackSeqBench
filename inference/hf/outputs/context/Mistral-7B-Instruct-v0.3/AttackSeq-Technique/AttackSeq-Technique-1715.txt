 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing using malicious '.lnk' files
   - Execution: Delivered PlugX malware as a primary payload
   - Defense Evasion: Used double extension trick and PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After spearphishing and using the double extension trick for defense evasion, the question asks about the technique facilitating communication with compromised systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state the technique used for communication, but it mentions the use of PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads, which are known to have command and control (C2) capabilities.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is a technique that involves using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the C2 functionality of PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
   - T1132.002-Non-Standard Encoding is a technique used for obfuscating data, not for communication. T1010-Application Window Discovery is not related to communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After spearphishing and using the double extension trick for defense evasion, Mustang Panda likely used T1071-Application Layer Protocol for communication with compromised systems, as this technique is associated with command and control functionality, which PlugX and Cobalt Strike are known to have.
