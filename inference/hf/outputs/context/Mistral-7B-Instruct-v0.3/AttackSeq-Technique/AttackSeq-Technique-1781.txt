 To answer this question, we need to identify the Discovery tactics (T1087) that Sayad malware uses to gather data from the compromised host, and then find the tactic that involves data collection from removable media (T1025).

From the CTI outline, we know that Sayad collects a wide range of information, including system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. However, it does not explicitly state that it collects data from removable media.

Since the question asks for the tactic that most likely involved capturing data specifically from removable media, we cannot definitively answer this question based on the provided CTI outline alone. The CTI outline does not provide enough evidence to support any of the answer choices.

Final Answer: I'm unable to provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
