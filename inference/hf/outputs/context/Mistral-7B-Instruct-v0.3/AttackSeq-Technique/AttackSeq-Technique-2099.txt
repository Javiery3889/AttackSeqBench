 Final Answer: C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attackers gained remote access to victims' computers by exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files and spear phishing.
   - Initial Access: T1192-Exploit Vulnerability
   - Initial Access: T1190-Spearphishing Attachment

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the technique that followed the initial access to facilitate communication between the malware and the framework's cloud infrastructure.
   - Communication: T1071-Command and Control

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the communication method between the malware and the cloud infrastructure. However, given the complexity of the Inception Framework, it is likely that they used a multi-hop proxy to maintain operational security and conceal their identities. This aligns with answer choice C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Initial Access: T1192-Exploit Vulnerability (RTF files with CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158)
   - Initial Access: T1190-Spearphishing Attachment (distribution via spear phishing emails)
   - Communication: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy (most likely used for communication between the malware and the cloud infrastructure due to the framework's operational security measures)
