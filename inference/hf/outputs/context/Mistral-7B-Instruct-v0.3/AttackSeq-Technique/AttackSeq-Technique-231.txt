 Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Lazarus group's backdoors are installed as services and employ encrypted configuration files to store C&C information necessary for secure communication with the C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to establish secure communication with C2 servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline mentions the use of encrypted configuration files for secure communication, which aligns with the T1573-Encrypted Channel technique. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the establishment of secure communication with C2 servers. T1104-Multi-Stage Channels refers to using multiple stages to deliver a payload, T1548.006-TCC Manipulation involves manipulating Trusted Computing Base (TCB) components, and T1055-Process Injection is about injecting code into existing processes, none of which are directly related to establishing encrypted communication channels.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1573-Encrypted Channel.
