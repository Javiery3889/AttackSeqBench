 Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails with malicious attachments (T1192 - Phishing: Attachment)
   - Execution: Malicious DLLs loaded by benign executables (T1055 - Command & Control: Native API)
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and malicious DLLs loading PlugX RAT implant (T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job, T1041 - Persistence - Registry Run Keys, T1055 - Command & Control: Native API)
   - Others: Mustang Panda uses various delivery mechanisms, including maldocs, shortcut files, malicious archives, and downloaders (T1101 - Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment, T1102 - Initial Access: Spearphishing Link, T1021 - Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application, T1077 - Initial Access: Network Service)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that Mustang Panda used malicious DLLs loaded by benign executables to deploy the PlugX implant (T1055). However, this technique is listed under the Execution phase, not Command and Control.
   - The CTI outline also mentions that Mustang Panda used stagers and reverse shells to ensure continued access to compromised systems, which could be considered a form of Command and Control. But these techniques are not directly related to deploying the PlugX implant.
   - The only technique listed in the CTI outline that could be related to deploying the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations is T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer, as it involves the delivery of malware to a system. This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a logical inference based on the information provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline describes Mustang Panda using phishing emails to deliver malware (T1192). This malware is then executed using benign executables that load malicious DLLs (T1055). However, the question asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations.
   - Since the PlugX implant is a type of malware, it is likely that it was delivered to the system using an initial access technique (T1101, T1102, T1021, or T1077) and then executed using T1055. But the question asks about the technique used to deploy the PlugX implant during Command and Control operations, which suggests that it was delivered after the initial access and execution phases.
   - The only technique that could logically fit this description is T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer, as it involves the delivery of malware to a system. Although this technique is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, it is a logical inference based on the information provided.
   - Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
