 Final Answer: B: T1132-Data Encoding

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: T1078 - Initial Access)
   - Execution: Malware runs in the background and collects information (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: T1086 - PowerShell)
   - Discovery: Malware collects sensitive information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data (MITRE ATT&CK tactic: T1041 - Data Staged)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to send the collected information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware collects sensitive information, but it does not provide details about how the information is sent out. However, the question mentions Base64 encoding, which is a data encoding technique (T1132).
   - The other answer choices do not involve data encoding or sending information out, so they can be eliminated.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware collects sensitive information (T1041 - Data Staged).
   - To send this information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix, the most likely ATT&CK technique is T1132 - Data Encoding. This technique can be used to encode the collected data before sending it out, which aligns with the question's requirements.
