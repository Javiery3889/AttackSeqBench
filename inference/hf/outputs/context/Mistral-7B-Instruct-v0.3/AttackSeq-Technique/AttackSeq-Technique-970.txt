 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that lead to the collection of detailed host and network information. The CTI outline mentions the following sequence:

1. Initial Access (T1078) - Various methods used, including a weaponized RTF file, archive files, and direct delivery.
2. Execution (T1055) - Aria-body loader is responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
3. Persistence (T1041) - The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, and some variants also inject into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
4. Defense Evasion (T1027) - The group uses fileless loading techniques and frequently changes server infrastructure and loader variants.
5. Collection (T1086) - The Aria-body backdoor collects detailed host and network information.

The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred prior to gathering data on installed software (T1518). In the given sequence, the technique that precedes T1518 is T1086, which is the collection of detailed host and network information. Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred prior to T1518 is T1086 - Data Stolen from Local System.

Final Answer: T1086 - Data Stolen from Local System.
