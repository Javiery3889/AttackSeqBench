 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that could lead to the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 by the lightSpy malware.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access was achieved through a watering hole attack, where malicious links led users to legitimate news sites while simultaneously loading and executing malicious code. This malicious code exploited vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2, resulting in the download of the lightSpy malware.

The sequence of TTPs that most likely occurred before the lightSpy malware employed a signed payload.dylib exploiting CVE-2019-8605 can be inferred as follows:

1. Initial Access (T1078 - Web-Based Attack)
2. Initial Access (T1192 - Exploit Public-Facing Application)
3. Initial Access (T1203 - Social Engineering)
4. Initial Access (T1566.002 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment)
5. Initial Access (T1190 - Exploit Development)

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before the lightSpy malware employed a signed payload.dylib, which is a specific exploitation technique. The lightSpy malware itself is the initial access vector in this case, and the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 is a subsequent technique. Therefore, there isn't a specific technique that occurred before the lightSpy malware employed a signed payload.dylib.

The question seems to be a bit misleading, as it asks for a technique that occurred before the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605, but the lightSpy malware is the initial access vector in this case, and the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 is a subsequent technique.

Final Answer: There isn't a specific technique that occurred before the lightSpy malware employed a signed payload.dylib exploiting CVE-2019-8605, as the lightSpy malware is the initial access vector in this case, and the exploitation of CVE-2019-8605 is a subsequent technique.
