 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malware downloaded from the internet and executed.
   - Execution: Malware initiates contact with the command and control server, downloads 'upnphost.exe'.
   - Persistence: 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Malware evades detection by submitting the dropper to Virus Total.
   - Discovery: Malware sends system information to IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred during the malware's communication with the C2 server using HTTPS with a POST method.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS (Executing technique) and sends system information to the server (Discovery technique).
   - The question does not mention any other techniques that involve application layer protocols, so T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the most likely answer as it involves communication using HTTPS, which is the protocol used in the CTI outline.
   - T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver, T1072-Software Deployment Tools, and T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance are not directly related to the communication between the malware and the C2 server using HTTPS.
