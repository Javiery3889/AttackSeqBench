 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that would allow Hidden Cobra to gather information about their potential victims, which they could use to target specific financial organizations.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Initial Access was achieved through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. This document was crafted to appear as an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution, and it contained an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). This technique allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code such as an implant, which in this case is the Bankshot implant.

So, the technique that most likely occurred before Hidden Cobra distributed their Bankshot implants through domains resembling legitimate cryptocurrency platforms is T1591-Gather Victim Org Information, as it involves the use of social engineering to gather information about the target organization. This information was then used to craft the spear phishing emails and the malicious document.

Final Answer: T1591-Gather Victim Org Information.
