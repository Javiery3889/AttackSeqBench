 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and compare it with the attack sequence in the CTI outline.

From the question, the sequence of TTPs is:
1. Lateral Movement (T1021) using Wmiexec
2. Account Discovery (T1087)

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence in the CTI outline:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Resource Development
3. Initial Access
4. Execution
5. Persistence
6. Privilege Escalation
7. Defense Evasion
8. Credential Access
9. Lateral Movement
10. Collection
11. Command and Control
12. Exfiltration

From the CTI outline, we can see that Lateral Movement (T1021) occurs before Account Discovery (T1087) in the sequence.

Final Answer: C: T1087-Account Discovery is the technique that most likely occurred after leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement.
