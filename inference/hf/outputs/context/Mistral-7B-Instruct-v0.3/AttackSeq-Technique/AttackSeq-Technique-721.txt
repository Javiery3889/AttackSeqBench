 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occur between the Rising Sun implant ensuring persistence and communicating with control servers.

From the CTI outline, we know that the Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder. After that, it did not set up any system network configuration or perform Internet connection discovery.

The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, but this action is not a Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) technique, as it involves network communication, not executing scripts.

Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred between the Rising Sun implant ensuring persistence and communicating with control servers is Command and Control (T1071). However, T1071 is not listed as an answer choice.

Since T1071 is a parent technique that includes various sub-techniques for command and control, we can look for a sub-technique that fits the context. T1071.003 - Ingress Tool uses HTTP for Command & Control is a sub-technique that involves HTTP POST requests, which aligns with the behavior described in the CTI outline.

Unfortunately, the answer choices do not include T1071.003. However, since T1071.003 is a sub-technique of T1071, we can infer that the answer is likely T1071 (Command and Control).

Final Answer: T1071 (Command and Control) is the most plausible answer, even though it is not an exact match with the provided answer choices.
