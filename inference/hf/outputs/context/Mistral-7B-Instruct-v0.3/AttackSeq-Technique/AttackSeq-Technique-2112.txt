 To answer this question, we need to find the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attackers were capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, which included screenshots. The Discovery and Exfiltration stages of the attack provide us with the necessary context.

The Discovery stage mentions that the loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including screenshots. However, the Exfiltration stage explicitly states that the backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, but it does not specify that screenshots were exfiltrated at the Discovery stage. This suggests that the screenshots were likely exfiltrated at a later stage, which is the Exfiltration stage.

Since the Exfiltration stage is the last stage before the Impact stage, and it is the stage where data is sent back to the attackers, it is the most likely stage where the screenshots were exfiltrated.

However, the question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to gather screenshots, not the stage where the screenshots were exfiltrated. The T1113-Screen Capture technique is the most appropriate ATT&CK technique that would be used to gather screenshots as part of the attackers' surveillance objectives.

Final Answer: T1113-Screen Capture.
