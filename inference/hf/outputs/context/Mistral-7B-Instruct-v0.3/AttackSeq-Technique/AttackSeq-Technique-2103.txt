 Final Answer: C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents
   - Execution: Exploitation of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders
   - Persistence: Creation of a scheduled task for maintaining foothold on the system
   - Discovery: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer
   - Collection: Data collection for surveillance objectives
   - Command and Control: Communication with a C&C server using encrypted messages
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration over the C&C channel
   - Impact: Capability to shut down the victim's computer

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the attackers used a multi-stage infection chain, which included the exploitation of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders (Execution). This stage is likely where the attackers would have implemented techniques to evade detection, such as T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, as it is a common technique used to bypass defense mechanisms in the infection chain.

   - T1564.010-Process Argument Spoofing, T1113-Screen Capture, and T1571-Non-Standard Port are not directly related to the evasion of defense mechanisms during the infection chain.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers used a multi-stage infection chain, which included the exploitation of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders. This stage is likely where the attackers would have implemented techniques to evade detection, such as T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-sandboxing techniques is C: T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
