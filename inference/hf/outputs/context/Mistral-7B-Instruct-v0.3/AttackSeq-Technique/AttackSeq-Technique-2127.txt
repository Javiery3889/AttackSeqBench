 Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: SSL-VPN abuse (T1105)
   - Execution: DESLoader (T1055), DLL side-loading (T1077), fileless implants (T1055), SodaMaster (T1055)
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks (T1053)
   - Defense Evasion: Fileless implants (T1055), DLL side-loading (T1077), event log removal (T1027)
   - Credential Access: Internal network scanning (T1087), RDP deployment (T1021), csvde.exe, AdFind (T1003)
   - Discovery: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports (T1080), WMIC (T1086), domain account discovery (T1087)
   - Command and Control: PowerShell remoting (T1050), IP addresses for C2 (T1071)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred before the attackers deployed RDP to target servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the attackers performed internal network scanning (T1087) to find open RDP and SMB ports after initial access via SSL-VPN. This discovery activity provided the attackers with the information needed to deploy RDP to servers (T1021).
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the deployment of RDP to target servers.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first discovered open RDP and SMB ports (T1080) and then deployed RDP to servers (T1021). Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred before the attackers achieved lateral movement by deploying RDP to target servers is T1021-Remote Services.
