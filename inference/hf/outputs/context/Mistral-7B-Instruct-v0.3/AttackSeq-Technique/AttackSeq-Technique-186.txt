 To answer this question, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that could be used for exfiltrating the gathered system information, such as Android ID and GPS information, to a remote location.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the "Exfiltration" tactic is the one that involves the automatic exfiltration of files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. This technique (T1086) is the most likely candidate for the next step after Infamous Chisel gathered the system information.

Final Answer: T1086-Exfiltration.
