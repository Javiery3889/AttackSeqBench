 Final Answer: C: T1018-Remote System Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. In the CTI outline, APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and later stages using open-source pentesting tools to map out the network.
2. The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the internal reconnaissance and network mapping.
3. T1018-Remote System Discovery involves the use of various tools to gather information about the target network, which aligns with the actor's actions of using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools for network mapping.
4. T1550-Use Alternative Authentication Material, T1016.002-Wi-Fi Discovery, and T1556.006-Multi-Factor Authentication are not directly related to network mapping or discovery, so they are less likely to have occurred after the internal reconnaissance and network mapping.
