 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occur after the phishing email delivery and before the BlackSoul malware starts evading defenses using dynamic string construction and cipher-based deobfuscation.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the phishing email delivers a CAB archive impersonating a document from the NIST website. This event corresponds to the T1192 - Phishing: Email Attachment technique.

The next event in the sequence is the execution of the malware, which is the 1-10-20-hb44_final.exe loader. This event corresponds to the T1055 - Command and Scripting Interpreter technique.

After the execution of the loader, the malware communicates with its C2 server to download the BlackSoul malware and the DLL, blacksoulLib. This event corresponds to the T1077 - Network Service Discovery technique.

The DLL, blacksoulLib, then performs credential access activities, such as searching for browser data and communicating with the C2 server to gather login information. This event corresponds to the T1003 - OS Credential Dumping technique.

So, the most likely sequence of TTPs that occurred after the phishing email delivery and before the BlackSoul malware evaded defenses using dynamic string construction and cipher-based deobfuscation is:

1. T1192 - Phishing: Email Attachment (Phishing email delivered a CAB archive)
2. T1055 - Command and Scripting Interpreter (Execution of the malware loader)
3. T1077 - Network Service Discovery (C2 communication for downloading BlackSoul and blacksoulLib)
4. T1003 - OS Credential Dumping (Credential access activities by the DLL)

Therefore, the final answer is: "T1003 - OS Credential Dumping".
