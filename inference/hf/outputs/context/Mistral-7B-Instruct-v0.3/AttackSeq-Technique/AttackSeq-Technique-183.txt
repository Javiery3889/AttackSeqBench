 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that could lead to the use of network sniffing or scraping files containing sensitive data, followed by scanning IP blocks and deploying tcpdump.

From the CTI outline, we can see that:
1. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges. It executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
2. Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates multiple data directories to discover files of interest, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers various system information such as the Android ID and other hardware information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network to discover other devices.
3. Collection: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions. It also collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.

However, the CTI outline does not mention any TTP related to scraping files containing sensitive data or deploying tcpdump. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided CTI outline.
