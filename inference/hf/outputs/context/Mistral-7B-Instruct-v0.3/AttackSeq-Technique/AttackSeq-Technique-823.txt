 Final Answer: B: T1056-Input Capture

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN4 targets individuals and organizes them using campaign codes.
   - Resource Development: FIN4 uses campaign codes to label the origin of stolen credentials.
   - Initial Access: FIN4 gains initial access through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to delete emails containing certain words.
   - Command and Control: FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred when FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question and the CTI outline both mention that FIN4 captures user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros. The answer choices do not directly mention the use of VBA macros, but we can infer that the technique should involve capturing user credentials.
   - T1528-Steal Application Access Token, T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule, and T1070-Indicator Removal do not involve capturing user credentials.
   - T1056-Input Capture is the technique that involves capturing user input, which aligns with the method FIN4 uses to capture credentials through VBA macros.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1056-Input Capture.
