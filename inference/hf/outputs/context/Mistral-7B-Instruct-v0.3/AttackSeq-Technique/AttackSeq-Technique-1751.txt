 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that could follow the action of dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.

From the CTI outline, we can see that after the initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, and discovery, the command and control (T1105) technique was used. However, the question asks for a technique that could occur after the use of compromised domain credentials (T1077) to access shared folders and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.

The technique T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols could be a plausible answer as it involves the use of publish/subscribe protocols for command and control. Since the NodeIISWeb malware provides backdoor functionality, allowing the threat actor to perform various actions on the affected host, it could potentially use a publish/subscribe protocol for command and control, especially if it's designed to avoid traditional command and control channels.

Final Answer: T1071.005-Publish/Subscribe Protocols.
