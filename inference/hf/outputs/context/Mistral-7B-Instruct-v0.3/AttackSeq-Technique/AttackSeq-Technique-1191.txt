 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing campaign using RMS to gain entry into networks.
   - Execution: Malicious MS Office documents delivered via phishing emails executed a macro to download malicious payloads from C2 infrastructure.
   - Persistence: RMS executable added to 'HKEY_CURRENT_USERS' hive, 'Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' key for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: RMS tool used for reconnaissance, lateral movement, and malicious activities within a victim network.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred when the RMS executable established communication with a C2 server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The RMS executable communicates with the C2 server to download malicious payloads. This communication happens during the Execution phase, but the question asks about the technique that occurred when the communication took place.
   - The Execution phase includes the T1071-Application Layer Protocol technique, which involves the use of application-layer protocols for command and control. In this case, the RMS executable uses an application-layer protocol to communicate with the C2 server, making T1071-Application Layer Protocol the most plausible answer.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The RMS executable communicates with the C2 server to download malicious payloads, which is an application-layer protocol communication.
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred when the RMS executable established communication with the C2 server.
   - The technique that best describes this communication is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
   - Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
