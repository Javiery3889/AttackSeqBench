 To answer this question, we need to identify the TTP (Technique) that is most likely to occur after the Discovery phase, which involves gathering extensive system information, and supports the group's objective during the Collection phase.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Aria-body backdoor collects data on installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data. This information gathering aligns with the T1086 - Process Discovery technique, which involves the collection of information about running processes, services, and network connections.

So, the most plausible sequence of TTPs in this case would be: Discovery (T1086) -> Collection (T1086).

Final Answer: T1086 - Process Discovery.
