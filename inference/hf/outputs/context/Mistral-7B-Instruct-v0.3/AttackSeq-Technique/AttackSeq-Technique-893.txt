 Final Answer: A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses spear-phishing emails to gain access, often exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255.
   - Execution: APT28 executes malware on victim systems through spear-phishing emails that deliver exploit documents.
   - Defense Evasion: APT28 evades defenses by using zero-day vulnerabilities, legitimate tools, and fabricated authorization requests.
   - Credential Access: APT28 harvests credentials through spear-phishing and uses tools like OLDBAIT.
   - Others: APT28 moves laterally within networks using legitimate tools and has been known to bypass security measures like two-factor authentication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique APT28 used to move deeper into victim networks following their exploitation of internet-facing servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT28 uses spear-phishing to gain initial access, exploits vulnerabilities to execute malware, and employs tools like OLDBAIT to harvest credentials. After gaining access, they evade defenses and move laterally within networks using legitimate tools.
   - Answer choice A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services aligns with the CTI outline as APT28 has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities to move deeper into victim networks.
   - Answer choices B, C, and D do not align with the CTI outline as they do not describe techniques for moving deeper into victim networks following the exploitation of internet-facing servers.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (spear-phishing), Execution (malware delivery), Credential Access (credential harvesting with OLDBAIT), and Defense Evasion (legitimate tool usage for lateral movement). The technique that most likely allowed APT28 to move deeper into victim networks following their exploitation of internet-facing servers is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
