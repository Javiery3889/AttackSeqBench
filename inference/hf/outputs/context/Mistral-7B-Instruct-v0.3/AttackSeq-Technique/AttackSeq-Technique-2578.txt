 Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email phishing attack with a malicious Word document.
   - Execution: JavaScript payload downloaded and executed.
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscation techniques used to hinder analysis and drop a file from a specified URL.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the attacker establishing communication with a URL to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we see that the attacker used a VBA-Macro to download a file from a specified URL and execute it. This aligns with the question's description of the attacker establishing communication with a URL to execute a file.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of application-layer protocols for command and control, which fits the scenario where the attacker communicates with the URL to execute the downloaded file.
   - T1566-Phishing, T1008-Fallback Channels, and T1650-Acquire Access do not directly involve the execution of a file from a URL, so they are less likely to be the correct answer.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
- Defense Evasion (T1566) - Obfuscation techniques used to hinder analysis and drop a file from a specified URL.
- Initial Access (T1192) - Email phishing attack with a malicious Word document.
- Execution (T1059) - JavaScript payload downloaded and executed.
- Command and Control (T1071) - Establishing communication with the URL to execute 'nanagrams.exe'.
