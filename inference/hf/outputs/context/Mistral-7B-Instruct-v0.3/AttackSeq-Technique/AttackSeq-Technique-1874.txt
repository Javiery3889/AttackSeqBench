 Final Answer: B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Scote malware uses legitimate third-party online services to host its C2 information and employs a series of techniques and tricks when loaded onto a victim machine, including layers of obfuscation.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The technique T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is related to the use of obfuscation to hide malicious content, which aligns with the use of layers of obfuscation mentioned in the CTI outline. The other techniques do not directly relate to the communication with C2 servers through Pastebin or Google+.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning: The Scote malware uses obfuscation techniques to hide its malicious content, making it difficult for security solutions to detect it. This obfuscation could also be used to hide the communication details with the C2 servers, which are hosted on Pastebin and Google+. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that facilitated the malware's communication with C2 servers is T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
