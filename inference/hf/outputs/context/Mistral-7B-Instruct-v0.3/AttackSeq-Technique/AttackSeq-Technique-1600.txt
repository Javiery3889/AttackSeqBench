 To answer this question, we need to find the technique that follows the keylogging and RAM scraping (Credential Access) and precedes the transmission of stolen credit card information (Exfiltration).

From the CTI outline, we can see that the malware does not perform T1057-Process Discovery, T1115-Clipboard Data, or T1555-Credentials from Password Stores as part of its attack sequence.

However, T1056-Input Capture, which involves capturing keystrokes, is a technique that follows the keylogging and RAM scraping (Credential Access) and precedes the transmission of stolen credit card information (Exfiltration). This is because the malware stores keystrokes in memory and transmits them upon pressing the Enter key, which could include card numbers and other sensitive information.

Final Answer: T1056-Input Capture.
