 Final Answer: C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. In the CTI outline, the malware collects keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents. This indicates that the malware is gathering information about the infected system.
2. The malware's collection of directory listings suggests that it is discovering files and directories on the infected system, which aligns with the T1083-File and Directory Discovery technique.
3. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the malware's collection of information about the infected system. T1546.015-Component Object Model Hijacking involves manipulating COM objects, T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery is about discovering connected devices, and T1205-Traffic Signaling is about sending or receiving messages to indicate the presence of a C2 channel. None of these techniques directly involve the collection of system information.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1083-File and Directory Discovery.
