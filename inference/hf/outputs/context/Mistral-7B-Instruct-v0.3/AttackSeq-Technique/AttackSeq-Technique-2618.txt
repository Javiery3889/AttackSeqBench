 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attackers collect sensitive information from victims' devices and transmit it back to their command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP POST requests.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the attackers' infrastructure was used to transmit stolen data back via HTTP POST requests.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The technique T1071-Application Layer Protocol involves the use of application layer protocols to communicate with the C&C server. In this case, the attackers are using HTTP POST requests to transmit stolen data, which aligns with the T1071 technique. The other techniques do not directly involve the transmission of data using application layer protocols. T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication is about maintaining persistent connections, T1078-Valid Accounts is about using valid accounts to access resources, and T1568.001-Fast Flux DNS is about using dynamic DNS to evade detection.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access (T1078) -> Collection (T1086, T1003, T1087, T1085, T1055) -> Command and Control (T1071). The question specifically asks about the technique used for transmitting stolen data, so the answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
