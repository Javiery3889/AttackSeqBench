 Final Answer: C: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) was used for initial access.
   - Defense Evasion: Seaduke was used for defense evasion and data exfiltration.
   - Credential Access: The Duke group used Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from MS Exchange Server.
   - Collection: Seaduke was used to collect detailed bot/system information and perform various actions like updating bot configuration, uploading files, and deleting the malware.
   - Exfiltration: Seaduke was used for exfiltrating data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred after the Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The techniques T1542.005-TFTP Boot and T1132-Data Encoding are not related to updating bot configurations or uploading files.
   - T1602-Data from Configuration Repository is about obtaining data from a configuration repository, which is not the same as updating bot configurations or uploading files.
   - T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy is about using multiple systems to reach the target, which could be used to maintain operational control in a campaign after updating bot configurations and uploading files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files. After these actions, they would need a way to maintain operational control, which is best achieved by using a multi-hop proxy (T1090.003). Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred after the Duke group collected detailed bot/system information and used Seaduke to update bot configurations and upload files is T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy.
