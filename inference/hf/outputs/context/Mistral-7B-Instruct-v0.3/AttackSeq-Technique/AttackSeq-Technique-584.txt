 Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (T1078), Execution (T1059), Defense Evasion (T1027, T1567), Credential Access (T1003, T1007), Discovery (T1087), Command and Control (T1071).

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used to execute commands on other systems within the network after gaining credential access through Mimikatz and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is Credential Access (T1003, T1007) and Command and Control (T1071). In the CTI outline, the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks (Credential Access) and used the AntSword webshell to communicate with the compromised server and run commands (Command and Control). However, the question asks for the TTP that was used to execute commands on other systems within the network. In the CTI outline, the actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands on the compromised server and uploaded tools like Impacket's wmiexec and atexec, which are designed for remote system access. Therefore, the most likely answer is T1021-Remote Services, as it involves executing commands on remote systems, which aligns with the use of the uploaded tools in this attack.
