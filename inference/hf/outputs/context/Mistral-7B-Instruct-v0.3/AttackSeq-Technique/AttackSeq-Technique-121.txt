 Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection.
   - Execution: Agrius deployed a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
   - Persistence: Agrius deployed webshells and registered its custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - Defense Evasion: Agrius used webshells with obfuscation and the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' contained functionality to evade defenses.
   - Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - Impact: Agrius deployed wipers and ransomware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that enabled Agrius to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network after using webshells for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Agrius initially gained access to systems by exploiting public-facing applications, which is not related to remote services. However, after gaining initial access, they used webshells for lateral movement, and then exploited the systems remotely using the .NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper'.
   - The answer choices do not directly mention the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, but T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services is the most plausible technique that aligns with the backdoor's functionality of exploiting a remote system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After Agrius used webshells for lateral movement, they deployed the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor on compromised systems. This backdoor was designed to exploit remote systems, making T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services the most likely technique that enabled them to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network.
   - Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services.
