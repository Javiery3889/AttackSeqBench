 Final Answer: Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - Initial Access: Automatic and manual vulnerability discovery, control of a server, further penetration of the internal network.
   - Execution: Injection of a web shell code into the server, use of a Trojan with a main executable binary and a DLL file.
   - Persistence: Installation of the Trojan with various service names and paths, use of other files and directories for tasks.
   - Defense Evasion: Hiding from detection tools, changing versions and builds, detaching suspicious API activities, setting custom configurations.
   - Credential Access: Leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - Command and Control: Use of a multi-tiered server backend framework.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain administrator passwords, the question asks about the most likely technique that occurred before the attackers utilized writable mass storage devices for USB infection to spread across the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Initial Access tactic describes the attackers gaining control of a server through automatic and manual vulnerability discovery. This is followed by the Execution tactic, where the attackers inject a web shell code into the server. The Persistence tactic describes the Trojan's installation on the server, but it does not mention the use of USB devices for spreading across the network. The Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Command and Control tactics do not provide information about the use of USB devices.
   - The Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210) tactic, which is mentioned in the Initial Access tactic, could have been used to gain initial access to the server before the attackers utilized the keylogging capabilities and the USB infection mechanism.

4. Final Answer: Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)
