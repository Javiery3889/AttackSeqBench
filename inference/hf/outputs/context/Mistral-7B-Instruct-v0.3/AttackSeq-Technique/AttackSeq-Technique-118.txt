 Final Answer: D: T1202-Indirect Command Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: T1078-Exploit Public-Facing Application
   - Execution: T1055.001-Command and Scripting Interpreter
   - Persistence: T1090-Persistent File/File System
   - Lateral Movement: T1021-Remote Services, T1077-Credential Access, T1086-PowerShell
   - Command and Control: T1055.003-Remote File Copy, T1086-PowerShell, T1077-Network Service
   - Impact: T1486-Data Encrypted for Impact

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about how Agrius ensured command execution and minimized detection after achieving persistence with the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is a command and scripting interpreter (T1055.001), which allows Agrius to execute commands on the compromised systems.
   - To minimize detection, Agrius communicated with C2 servers over HTTP (T1071.003) using a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses. This indirect command execution (T1202) could help Agrius avoid detection by hiding the malicious commands within seemingly harmless HTTP traffic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - Agrius gained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications (T1078).
   - After achieving persistence with the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor (T1090), Agrius ensured command execution by using the backdoor as a command and scripting interpreter (T1055.001).
   - To minimize detection, Agrius communicated with C2 servers over HTTP (T1071.003) using a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses, which allowed for indirect command execution (T1202). This indirect method of command execution could help Agrius avoid detection by hiding the malicious commands within seemingly harmless HTTP traffic.
