 Final Answer: B: T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Watering hole tactics, exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782, delivery of malware.
   - Execution: Shellcode execution, download of 'dropper.dll', checks for security software, download and execution of three additional malware samples.
   - Defense Evasion: Checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - Discovery: Interaction with a Mattermost server, exfiltration of system information, capturing screenshots.
   - Command and Control: Communication with a Mattermost server, individual channels for each infected machine.
   - Exfiltration: Exfiltration of system information from infected machines to the Mattermost server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about a sequence of TTPs that occurred after executing shellcode through chained exploits to download and run 'dropper.dll' and before implementing checks for security software to avoid detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence in the question is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline, but we can infer that the attackers would want to establish a foothold in the system with higher privileges before implementing checks to avoid detection.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery would typically be used to gather information about the system, but it doesn't necessarily involve executing malware backdoors with system privileges.
   - T1546.016-Installer Packages and T1021.007-Cloud Services are not directly related to the sequence in the question.
   - T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is a plausible answer as it involves the use of exploits to gain higher system privileges, which would occur before implementing checks to avoid detection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first executed shellcode through chained exploits to download and run 'dropper.dll'.
   - After downloading 'dropper.dll', the next logical step would be to gain higher system privileges to ensure the malware can persist and operate undetected.
   - T1068-Exploitation for Privilege Escalation is the most likely technique that occurred to allow malware backdoors to execute with system privileges.
