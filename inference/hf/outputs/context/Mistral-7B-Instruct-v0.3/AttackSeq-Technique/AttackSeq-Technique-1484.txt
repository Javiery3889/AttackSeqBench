 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the CTI outline that occur before and after the specific event of Babar's implant reducing forensic artifacts by deleting the dropper binary.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the dropper is deleted after it has executed and before the implant is injected into running processes. The implant is then responsible for reducing forensic artifacts by hiding the DLL in the file system and using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module.

The techniques mentioned in the CTI outline that occur before the dropper is deleted are:
1. Execution (T1055) - The dropper is the initial execution of the malware.
2. Persistence (T1070) - Babar ensures persistence by creating a registry key.

The techniques mentioned in the CTI outline that occur after the dropper is deleted and before the implant reduces forensic artifacts are:
1. Collection (T1086) - Babar's implant is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, spying on installed softphones and instant messengers, and stealing data from office applications.
2. Command and Control (T1071) - Babar communicates with C&C servers.
3. Exfiltration (T1041) - Babar compresses and encrypts data before dumping it to disk.

Since we are looking for the technique that most likely occurred after Babar's implant reduces forensic artifacts by executing a cmd.exe process to delete the dropper binary, we can eliminate T1055 (Execution) and T1070 (Persistence) as they occur before the dropper is deleted.

Between T1086 (Collection), T1071 (Command and Control), and T1041 (Exfiltration), we cannot definitively say which one occurred immediately after the dropper is deleted without more specific information about the sequence of events. However, since the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred before Babar actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module, it is reasonable to assume that the implant would first establish communication with the C&C server (T1071) and then start exfiltrating data (T1041) before actively stealing data from applications.

Therefore, the technique that most likely occurred after Babar's implant reduces forensic artifacts by executing a cmd.exe process to delete the dropper binary and before it actively steals data from applications using global Windows hooks and a keylogger module is T1071 - Command and Control.

Final Answer: T1071 - Command and Control.
