 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the question and find their sequence in the CTI outline.

1. Anti-sandboxing techniques and encrypted victim data during the infection chain: This corresponds to the Defense Evasion tactic (T1055).
2. Install a backdoor capable of collecting a wide range of system data for surveillance purposes: This corresponds to the Collection tactic (T1086).

Now, let's analyze the CTI outline to find the sequence of these two tactics:

- Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents
- Execution: Leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor
- Persistence: Created a scheduled task to maintain the foothold on the system
- Defense Evasion: Employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques
- Collection: The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Defense Evasion (T1055) and Collection (T1086) tactics occur consecutively in the attack sequence.

Now, let's compare the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:

- Anti-sandboxing techniques and encrypted victim data during the infection chain (T1055)
- Install a backdoor capable of collecting a wide range of system data for surveillance purposes (T1086)

The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the attackers employed anti-sandboxing techniques and encrypted victim data during the infection chain and before the attackers installed a backdoor capable of collecting a wide range of system data for surveillance purposes. Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs matches the question's requirements, so the answer is T1086 - Collection.

Final Answer: T1086 - Collection.
