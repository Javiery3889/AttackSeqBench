 Final Answer: D: T1189-Drive-by Compromise

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The Sakula malware is used in various campaigns, including the French Aerospace Campaign and the Ironman Campaign, which involves C2 communications with a domain or IP address.
   - The Sakula malware is also linked to PlugX, and there is evidence that they have relied on the same C2 infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions a first stage downloader saving a file at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" that later retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
   - The question does not specify how the adversary gained access to the compromised website, but it is implied that the website was compromised.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1566.003-Spearphishing via Service is not directly related to the downloading of files from a compromised website.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel and T1648-Serverless Execution are not related to the initial compromise of a website.
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise is a technique that involves exploiting a vulnerability in a website to download malware, which aligns with the scenario described in the question.

4. The question does not provide any context about the use of a compromised website spoofing the "Center on Budget and Policy Priorities," but the technique T1189-Drive-by Compromise is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that could lead to the downloading of malware from a compromised website, regardless of the specific website's identity.
