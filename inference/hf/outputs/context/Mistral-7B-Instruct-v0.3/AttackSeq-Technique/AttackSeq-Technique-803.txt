 To answer this question, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that could enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server after the JavaScript file created 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attack sequence is as follows:
1. Initial Access (T1078: Phishing)
2. Execution (T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter)
3. Persistence (T1053: Scheduled Task/Job)
4. Defense Evasion (T1041: Obfuscated Files or Information)
5. Discovery (T1087: Network Service Discovery)

However, the question asks about a technique that most likely occurred to enable HTTPS communication with the C&C server, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

The answer choices provided are:
A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
B: T1053-Scheduled Task/Job
C: T1090.001-Internal Proxy
D: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery

Since the question is about enabling HTTPS communication, we can infer that the attacker might have used an application layer protocol (T1071) to establish a secure connection with the C&C server. However, the CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of this.

The other answer choices do not seem to be directly related to enabling HTTPS communication. T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job) was used for persistence, T1041 (Obfuscated Files or Information) was used for defense evasion, and T1087 (Network Service Discovery) was used for discovery. T1090.001 (Internal Proxy) is a technique for proxying traffic internally, which is not necessarily related to enabling HTTPS communication.

Therefore, while we cannot definitively say that T1071 was used to enable HTTPS communication, it is the most plausible answer based on the information provided.

Final Answer: A: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
