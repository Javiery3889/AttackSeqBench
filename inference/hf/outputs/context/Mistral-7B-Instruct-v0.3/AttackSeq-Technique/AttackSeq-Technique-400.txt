 Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file.
   - Execution: The malicious Excel file uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable within a function.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicates over SSL to hide its activities.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique used to hide the malware's activities from analysis by debuggers and sandboxes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malicious Excel file uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection, which is a form of obfuscation.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is a technique that involves making files or information difficult to understand or analyze by using encryption, compression, or other transformations.
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol, T1564.009-Resource Forking, and T1610-Deploy Container are not directly related to obfuscation or hiding activities from analysis tools.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware uses ASCII character codes to obfuscate its activities within the malicious Excel file, making it difficult for analysis tools to understand the malicious code. This aligns with the technique T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
   - Final Answer: A: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information.
