 Final Answer: D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Elise malware is distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document and exploits CVE-2017-11882.
   - Execution: Elise malware injects NavShExt.dll into iexplore.exe and sends data to and downloads files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server.
   - Persistence: Elise malware modifies the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
   - Defense Evasion: Elise malware employs various defense evasion techniques, but the CTI outline does not specify any communication with the C2 server in this context.
   - Discovery: Elise malware harvests system information, but the CTI outline does not specify any communication with the C2 server in this context.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the communication between the Elise malware and the hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Elise malware communicates with the hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.
   - The answer choices do not directly specify the communication method, but T1071-Application Layer Protocol refers to the use of application-layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the communication between the Elise malware and the C2 server.
   - T1497-Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, T1574.010-Services File Permissions Weakness, and T1571-Non-Standard Port do not directly relate to the communication between the Elise malware and the C2 server.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
