 Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers subverted the software 'Alpha' at its distribution point with malicious, signed code in April 2015.
   - Command and Control: The Kingslayer backdoor and the secondary malware, K2, used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for command and control (C2).
   - Others: The Kingslayer backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred before the Kingslayer backdoor evaded detection using a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Kingslayer backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code. This suggests that the backdoor had to evade detection initially, which is consistent with the T1027 technique (Defense Evasion).
   - T1027.014 (Polymorphic Code) is a specific technique under T1027 (Defense Evasion) that involves changing the code of the malware to evade detection. This technique could have been used to make the Kingslayer backdoor undetectable by antivirus software, allowing it to be loaded and evade detection before it started beaconing.
   - The other answer choices do not directly relate to the evasion of detection before the beaconing pattern was established. T1219 (Remote Access Software) is about establishing a remote connection to a system, T1556.001 (Domain Controller Authentication) is about authenticating to a domain controller, and T1553 (Subvert Trust Controls) is about manipulating security software to bypass security controls. While these techniques might have been used later in the attack, they do not seem to be the most likely technique that occurred before the backdoor evaded detection.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code.
