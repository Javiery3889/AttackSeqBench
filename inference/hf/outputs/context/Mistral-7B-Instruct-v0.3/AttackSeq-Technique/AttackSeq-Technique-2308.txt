 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that could occur after the adversary attempted to clean up traces of their intrusions and before they utilized PsLogList as part of their discovery efforts.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the adversary used various methods for lateral movement (T1021) after gaining initial access and before performing discovery (T1087). Lateral movement involves moving within a network to access resources, and it is a common step after cleaning up traces and before performing discovery.

However, the question specifically asks for a technique that occurred between these two events. The CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence of TTPs that fits this description. The adversary did not explicitly exploit remote services (T1192), execute code or scripts (T1059), or perform privilege escalation (T1078) in the sequence mentioned in the question.

Therefore, it is challenging to definitively answer this question based on the provided CTI outline. However, since the question asks for a technique that could occur between cleaning up traces and using PsLogList, one plausible answer could be T1086 - PowerShell, as the adversary used PowerShell to install Cobalt Strike and its beacon. This technique could have been used to perform additional actions before or after the discovery phase, such as executing scripts to prepare the environment for data collection or exfiltration.

Final Answer: A plausible answer could be T1086 - PowerShell, as it is a versatile technique that could be used for various purposes after cleaning up traces and before discovery. However, this is not a definitive answer based on the provided CTI outline.
