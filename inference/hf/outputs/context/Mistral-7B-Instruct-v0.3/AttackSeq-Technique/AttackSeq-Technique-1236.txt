 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that could be used to load an embedded DLL file within a resource, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that the Initial Access technique (T1078) was used to deploy WinDealer on the target machine.

Once the malware is executed, it doesn't necessarily need to use T1021-Remote Services, T1129-Shared Modules, or T1053.006-Systemd Timers to load an embedded DLL file. Instead, it can use T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol, which allows an attacker to communicate with the malware and potentially load additional components, including DLL files.

Final Answer: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol.
