 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK technique that would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the victim system, which is the prerequisite for the Tuyul malware to execute Perl scripts and shell commands.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841). This vulnerability allows the attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code on the server.

The MITRE ATT&CK technique that corresponds to exploiting a vulnerability is T1587.004 - Exploits. Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred before Tuyul malware executed Perl scripts and shell commands is T1587.004-Exploits.

Final Answer: T1587.004-Exploits.
