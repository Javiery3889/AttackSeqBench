 Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Tropic Trooper exploited security flaws in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
   - Persistence: The backdoor was set to load and decrypt its configuration file, then connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.
   - Defense Evasion: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection. The installer dropped files and created a hidden directory to deceive users. The loader, named FakeRun, executed dllhost.exe and injected a malicious DLL file into this process.
   - Command and Control: Tropic Trooper's backdoor used SSL to connect to its C&C server, and the C&C server's configuration values can be easily changed/updated.
   - Others: Tropic Trooper used exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware, and the MSI file dropped files and created a hidden directory to deceive users. The installer used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we can see that the installer was dropped and executed by the user (dllhost.exe) and injected into the process to run the backdoor. This aligns with the technique T1204-User Execution, which describes the execution of a malicious file by a user or a process controlled by the user.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1564.009-Resource Forking, and T1648-Serverless Execution do not directly relate to the user's action or interaction to trigger the backdoor's deployment.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is D: T1204-User Execution.
