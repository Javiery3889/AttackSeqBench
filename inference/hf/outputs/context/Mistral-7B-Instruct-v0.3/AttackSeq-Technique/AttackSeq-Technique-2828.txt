 Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing email with a malicious CAB archive (1-10-20-hb44_final) delivering BlackSoul RAT.
   - Execution: Malicious loader (1-10-20-hb44_final.exe) uses C2 infrastructure hosted on Cloudflare Workers service.
   - Defense Evasion: BlackSoul uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
   - Credential Access: BlackSoul's DLL (blacksoulLib) generates login information for the C2.
   - Collection: BlackSoul collects data and supports handling commands from its C2 server.
   - Exfiltration: BlackSoul exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred to enable communication with C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware uses the Cloudflare Workers service for communication with its C2 infrastructure.
   - Answer choices A, C, and D do not directly relate to communication with the C2 infrastructure over the Cloudflare Workers service.
   - Answer choice B, T1102-Web Service, refers to the use of web services for communication, which aligns with the malware's use of the Cloudflare Workers service for communication with its C2 infrastructure.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1102-Web Service.
