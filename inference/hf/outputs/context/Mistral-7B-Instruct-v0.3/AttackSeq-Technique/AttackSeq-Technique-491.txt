 Final Answer: C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Watering hole attack using malicious links on forums leading to legitimate news sites with hidden iframe exploiting iOS vulnerabilities.
   - Execution: lightSpy malware installs a modular backdoor for remote command execution and file manipulation.
   - Collection: lightSpy malware collects and exfiltrates a wide range of data from the infected device.
   - Command and Control: lightSpy malware uses hardcoded C&C server locations.
   - Others: No specific technique related to the question is mentioned.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that enabled the malware to maintain evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, it is mentioned that the lightSpy malware is designed to execute commands remotely and exfiltrate data. However, the question specifically asks for a technique that enabled evasion by exploiting a Safari bug and using a signed Apple developer certificate.
   - T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1557.003-DHCP Spoofing, and T1600.001-Reduce Key Space do not directly relate to exploiting a Safari bug or using a signed Apple developer certificate.
   - T1553-Subvert Trust Controls, on the other hand, involves the use of a legitimate digital certificate to bypass security controls, which aligns with the use of a signed Apple developer certificate in the CTI outline. The exploitation of a Safari bug is not explicitly mentioned in the ATT&CK framework, but it can be inferred that the malware might have used a Safari-specific vulnerability to execute its code, which would fit the "evasion" aspect of the question.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls.
