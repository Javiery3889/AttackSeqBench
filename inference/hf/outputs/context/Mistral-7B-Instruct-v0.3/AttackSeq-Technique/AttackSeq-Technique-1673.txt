 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that would allow the attackers to execute PowerShell scripts, which later led to the deployment of Cobalt Strike and the .NET injector for the WastedLocker attack.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attackers initially compromised the system using a malicious JavaScript-based framework (SocGholish) and then executed a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, which downloaded additional PowerShell scripts. Later, they used Cobalt Strike for various purposes, including credential dumping and lateral movement.

The PowerShell scripts downloaded by the initial JavaScript execution are the key to our answer. The techniques related to command and control (T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter) and Windows Command Shell (T1059.003-Windows Command Shell) are not directly related to PowerShell scripts. Remote Services (T1021-Remote Services) is not mentioned in the initial access or privilege escalation stages.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attackers used T1086-PowerShell, which is the technique for executing PowerShell scripts, before deploying Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to execute a loader containing the .NET injector for the WastedLocker attack.

Final Answer: T1086-PowerShell.
