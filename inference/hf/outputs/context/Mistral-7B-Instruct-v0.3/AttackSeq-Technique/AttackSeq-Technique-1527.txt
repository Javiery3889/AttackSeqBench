 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occurred between the initial access and persistence stages in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: T1192.002-Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment
2. Execution: T1055.001-Code Injection, T1055.003-DLL Search Order Modification, T1055.004-DLL Side-loading, T1055.006-Process Injection, T1055.007-Process Hollowing, T1055.010-Process Dropper, T1055.011-Extra Procedure Call (EPC)
3.
