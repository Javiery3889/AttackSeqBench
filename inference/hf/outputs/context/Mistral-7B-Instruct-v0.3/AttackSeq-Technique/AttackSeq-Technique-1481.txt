 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that could lead to the reduction of forensic artifacts before the dropper executes a command line to delete the dropper binary from disk. The technique that best fits this description is T1564-Hide Artifacts, which involves modifying system or application settings to hide or delete logs, files, or other evidence of an attacker's presence or activity.

In the CTI outline, we can see that the dropper hides the DLL in the file system and then deletes the dropper binary by executing a command line. This action is a form of hiding artifacts, making T1564-Hide Artifacts the most likely technique that occurred before the dropper reduces forensic artifacts.

Final Answer: T1564-Hide Artifacts.
