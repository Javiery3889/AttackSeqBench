 Final Answer: C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) was used for initial access.
   - Defense Evasion: Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, was used to steal sensitive information.
   - Credential Access: The Duke group used Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks and email extraction from MS Exchange Server.
   - Collection: Seaduke allows attackers to exfiltrate data securely.
   - Command and Control: Seaduke communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS channels.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique used when the Duke group transmitted sensitive information utilizing legitimate cloud services.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that Seaduke allows attackers to exfiltrate data securely, and it communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS channels.
   - Answer choice C: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service, which involves exfiltrating data over web services, aligns best with the attack sequence and the context that the Duke group uses legitimate cloud services for data transmission.
   - Answer choices A, B, and D do not directly relate to the exfiltration of data using legitimate cloud services.
