 Final Answer: C: T1614-System Location Discovery

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (not relevant to data collection)
   - Execution: XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7
   - Command and Control: XAgent app sends information out via HTTP, including geo-location data (indicated by the use of GET and POST requests)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique most likely used to collect geo-location data from the device

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1132-Data Encoding is about encoding data for exfiltration, not about collecting data
   - T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules is related to using external authentication methods, not geo-location data collection
   - T1033-System Owner/User Discovery is about identifying system administrators or users, not geo-location data collection
   - T1614-System Location Discovery is about collecting geo-location data from the device, which aligns with the context provided in the CTI outline and the question

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The XAgent app sends information out via HTTP, including geo-location data. Since T1614-System Location Discovery is about collecting geo-location data from the device, it is the most likely technique used in this scenario. Therefore, the final answer is C: T1614-System Location Discovery.
