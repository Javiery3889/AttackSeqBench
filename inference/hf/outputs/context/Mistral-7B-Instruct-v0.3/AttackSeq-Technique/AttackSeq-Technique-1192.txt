 Final Answer: C: T1219-Remote Access Software

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (T1192 - Spearphishing Attachment), Execution (T1203 - User Execution), Persistence (T1070 - Persistence - Technique T1547.002 - Registry Run Keys), Defense Evasion (T1086 - PowerShell), and the use of Remote Manipulator System (RMS) is a part of the Defense Evasion tactic.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the technique that allowed the RMS executable to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure after the download of malicious payloads via nefarious macros.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The technique T1219 - Remote Access Software is the most plausible answer as it describes the use of remote administration tools to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure. In this case, the RMS tool is used for both defense evasion and maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure. The other techniques mentioned in the answer choices do not directly relate to maintaining contact with the threat actor's infrastructure. T1665-Hide Infrastructure is about hiding the infrastructure used in the attack, T1059.007-JavaScript is about using JavaScript for the execution phase, and T1566-Phishing is about using phishing for the initial access phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer: The RMS tool, used for defense evasion, is also likely used to maintain contact with the threat actor's infrastructure. This is because the malicious payloads downloaded via the nefarious macros include the RMS tool, which is then launched and used for reconnaissance and lateral movement within the victim network. This continuous communication between the RMS executable and the threat actor's infrastructure suggests that T1219 - Remote Access Software is the most likely answer.
