 Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
   - Execution: The HTA file executed a script that stopped if certain antivirus software was detected.
   - Persistence: The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
   - Defense Evasion: Sidewinder's HTA file avoided using PowerShell and instead used VBS. The backdoor also employed DLL sideloading.
   - Discovery: The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the technique that most likely occurred to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system. However, it does not explicitly state how the information was sent to the C2 server.
   - Among the answer choices, T1082-System Information Discovery involves the collection of system information, which includes antivirus software details. Since the HTA file used WMI to discover antivirus software, it is reasonable to assume that this information was sent to the C2 server as part of the system information collection.
   - T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy and T1071-Application Layer Protocol do not directly relate to sending system information to the C2 server. T1556.007-Hybrid Identity is not related to sending information about antivirus software.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system (Discovery). Since the HTA file is communicating with the C2 server (as indicated by the use of webserv-redir.net), it is likely that the information about detected antivirus software was sent to the C2 server as part of the system information collection (T1082-System Information Discovery).
   - Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery.
