 Final Answer: C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the technique that most likely facilitates the transfer of information collected by CosmicDuke (keyloggers, screenshotters, clipboard stealers) to remote servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, it is stated that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware. This aligns best with the technique T1020-Automated Exfiltration, which involves the use of custom tools or built-in capabilities to transfer data from the victim to the attacker's server.

4. The other answer choices do not directly relate to the transfer of data collected by CosmicDuke. T1025-Data from Removable Media refers to the removal of data from the victim to a removable media device, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline. T1590-Gather Victim Network Information and T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service are not directly related to the tools (keyloggers, screenshotters, clipboard stealers) used by CosmicDuke to collect information.
