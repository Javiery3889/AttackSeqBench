 Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute "%Temp%/Rdws.exe"
   - Initial Access: Execution of "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" leads to the creation of another file "%TEMP%/adobe.dat"
   - Initial Access: "%TEMP%/adobe.dat" is a first-stage downloader for a second-stage PlugX file
   - Command and Control: The second-stage PlugX file connects to several C2 domains beginning with cdn[.]sanecat[.]com

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated the communication between the second-stage PlugX file and the C2 domains

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the second-stage PlugX file communicates with C2 domains, but it does not specify the exact technique used for this communication
   - T1001.002-Steganography is not related to communication between a malware and a C2 server
   - T1189-Drive-by Compromise is the initial exploitation of a vulnerability, not the communication between a malware and a C2 server
   - T1005-Data from Local System is about exfiltrating data from a compromised system, not the communication between a malware and a C2 server
   - T1071-Application Layer Protocol is about using application layer protocols for command and control, which aligns with the communication between the second-stage PlugX file and the C2 domains

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The second-stage PlugX file communicates with C2 domains, and T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that involves using application layer protocols for command and control. Since there is no other information in the CTI outline that contradicts this, the most plausible answer is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
