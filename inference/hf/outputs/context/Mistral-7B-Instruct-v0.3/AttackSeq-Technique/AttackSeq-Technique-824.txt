 Final Answer: C: T1090-Proxy

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN4 performs reconnaissance on individuals with access to confidential information.
   - Resource Development: FIN4 organizes their targets using campaign codes and C2 servers.
   - Initial Access: FIN4 gains initial access through spearphishing emails with VBA macros or fake OWA login pages.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to delete emails containing certain keywords.
   - Credential Access: FIN4 steals credentials through spearphishing emails and fake OWA login pages.
   - Others: FIN4 has been active since mid-2013, targets over 100 organizations, and uses their access to insider information for potential stock price manipulation.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that facilitated FIN4's anonymous communication with their C2 infrastructure after transmitting stolen credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information is about gathering information about the victim, not facilitating communication with C2 servers.
   - T1590.002-DNS is about using DNS for command and control, but it doesn't necessarily ensure anonymous communication.
   - T1090-Proxy is about using proxies for command and control, which could provide anonymity for FIN4's communication with their C2 servers.
   - T1205.001-Port Knocking is about establishing a connection with a system by sending specific data patterns to open a port, but it doesn't necessarily ensure anonymity.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN4 steals credentials and transmits them to their C2 servers. To maintain anonymity while communicating with their C2 infrastructure, they likely use proxies (T1090). Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: T1090-Proxy.
