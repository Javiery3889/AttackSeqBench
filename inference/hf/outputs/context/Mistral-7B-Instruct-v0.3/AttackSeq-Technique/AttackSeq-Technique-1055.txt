 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and compare it with the attack sequence from the CTI outline.

From the question, we can see that the sequence of TTPs mentioned is:
1. Deployment of malware components (T1204)
2. Keylogger module usage (T1056)
3. Data encryption in log files (Not explicitly mentioned in MITRE ATT&CK, but we can infer it as T1027 - Data Encrypted)

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access (T1078)
2. Execution (T1059)
3. Persistence (T1075)
4. Defense Evasion (T1027, T1086)
5. Credential Access (T1003, T1087)
6. Command and Control (T1071)

From the CTI outline, we can see that the deployment of malware components (T1204) happens during the Initial Access and Execution phases. The keylogger module usage (T1056) and data encryption in log files (T1027) are part of the Defense Evasion and Command and Control phases, respectively.

However, the question asks for the TTP that most likely occurred after deploying malware components like information stealers and advanced keyloggers on victims' systems. Since the keylogger module is one of the malware components deployed, it is not the TTP that occurred after its deployment. Therefore, the TTP that most likely occurred after deploying malware components is the data encryption in log files (T1027).

Final Answer: T1027 - Data Encrypted.
