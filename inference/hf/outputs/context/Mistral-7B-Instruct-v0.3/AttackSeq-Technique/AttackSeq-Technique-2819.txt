 Final Answer: B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: T1078.001 - Initial Access via SSH
   - Execution: T1055 - Execution
   - Persistence: T1041 - Persistence
   - Defense Evasion: T1567 - Defense Evasion
   - Discovery: T1080 - System Discovery

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions Derusbi malware sending system information to a command and control server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery tactic (T1080) describes Derusbi gathering system information, but it does not mention sending this information anywhere.
   - The question does not mention any other tactics from the CTI outline.
   - T1055 (Execution) and T1041 (Persistence) do not involve sending system information to a command and control server.
   - T1567 (Defense Evasion) does not involve sending system information or communication with a command and control server.
   - T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) could potentially involve sending system information, but it does not specify HTTP POST requests to a specific URL.
   - T1102.002 (Bidirectional Communication) involves two-way communication, which aligns with the question's description of Derusbi sending system information via HTTP POST requests.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that Derusbi gathered system information (T1080) and then established persistence (T1041).
   - After these steps, it is most likely that Derusbi would establish communication with the command and control server to send the gathered system information (T1102.002).
   - The question asks about the technique used to send this information via HTTP POST requests to a specific URL, which aligns with T1102.002. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication.
