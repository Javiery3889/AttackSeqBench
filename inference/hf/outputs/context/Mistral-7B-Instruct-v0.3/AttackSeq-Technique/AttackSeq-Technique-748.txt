 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques mentioned in the CTI outline that could occur after Tortoiseshell ensured their malware could bypass network-based defenses and before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed system information for further attacks.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Tortoiseshell used a malware downloader to gain initial access (T1192 - Exploit Public-Facing Application), executed the malware downloader (T1203 - PowerShell), and installed and executed a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT) as a service to maintain persistence (T1055 - Persistent File System). However, these techniques do not involve confirming Google was reachable or directly relate to sandbox evasion, which is a requirement for the question.

The CTI report mentions that Tortoiseshell used a fake website to host malware, which could be considered a phishing attempt (T1566 - Phishing). However, the question specifies that the malware has already bypassed network-based defenses, and phishing is typically the initial step in an attack, not something that occurs after the initial access and before the reconnaissance phase.

The question also mentions the possibility of Tortoiseshell confirming Google was reachable to bypass network-based defenses. While the CTI outline does not explicitly state this, it does mention that the malware downloader executed two binaries from a remote server (hxxp://199[.]187[.]208[.]75/MyWS.asmx/GetUpdate?val=UID). This could be a way to ensure the malware can communicate with the C2 server, which is outside the victim's network, bypassing network-based defenses.

The technique that most likely occurred after Tortoiseshell ensured Google was reachable and before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed system information for further attacks is T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion. This technique could involve the malware checking for signs of a sandbox or virtual environment before executing its full payload, which aligns with the malware downloading and executing two binaries from a remote server before performing the reconnaissance.

Final Answer: T1497 - Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
