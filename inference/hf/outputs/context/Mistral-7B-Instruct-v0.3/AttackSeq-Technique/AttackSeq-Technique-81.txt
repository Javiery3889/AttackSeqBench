 Final Answer: A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: OnionDog uses OnionDog malware transmitted through a USB Worm to penetrate network isolation.
   - Defense Evasion: OnionDog uses USB disk drive ferry to break the false sense of security of physical isolation and generate USB worms to infiltrate the target internal network.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that occurred when the Trojan successfully released and downloaded additional malware after penetrating network isolation using USB worms.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that OnionDog uses USB worms to penetrate network isolation and then generates USB worms to infiltrate the target internal network. This suggests that additional malware is downloaded and released within the target network.
   - Answer choice A: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer describes the technique of transferring tools or payloads into the target environment, which aligns with the scenario described in the CTI outline.
   - Answer choices B, C, and D do not directly relate to the downloading and releasing of additional malware within the target network after penetrating it using USB worms.
