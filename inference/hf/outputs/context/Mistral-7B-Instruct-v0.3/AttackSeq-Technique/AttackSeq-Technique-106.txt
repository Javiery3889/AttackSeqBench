 Final Answer: C: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Waterbear uses a DLL loader to execute a backdoor that can receive and load additional executables from external attackers.
   - Defense Evasion: Waterbear employs API hooking to evade detection by modifying functions in memory.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the malware connected to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that Waterbear can receive and load additional executables from external attackers. This action requires a connection to external entities.
   - The answer choices provided are related to different stages of the attack, but only T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer directly refers to the transfer of tools or files from an external source, which aligns with the action described in the CTI outline.
   - T1090.001-Internal Proxy is about using an internal network to connect to the internet, but it doesn't directly involve receiving additional payloads or files.
   - T1072-Software Deployment Tools is about using legitimate software to install malware, but it doesn't involve connecting to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files.
   - T1564-Hide Artifacts is about covering the tracks of the attack, not about connecting to external entities for receiving additional payloads or files.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:
   - Defense Evasion (API hooking)
   - Command and Control (T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer)
