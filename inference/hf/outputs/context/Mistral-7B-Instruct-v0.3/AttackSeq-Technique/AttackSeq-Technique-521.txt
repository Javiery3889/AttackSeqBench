 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK techniques that occur between anti-behavioral analysis methods (T1055) and encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections for command and control communications (T1071.003).

From the CTI outline, we know that the malware was installed and set up a persistence mechanism (T1090) before it started using anti-behavioral analysis methods and obfuscation techniques. After the malware was installed and persistence was established, it's likely that the malware would perform some actions to maintain its functionality and prepare for command and control communication. One such action could be loading and executing additional modules or libraries (T1218.001 or T1218.002). However, since the CTI outline mentions that the malware employed a malicious DLL payload, it's more likely that T1218.008 - Shared Modules was used to load the malicious DLL.

After loading the malicious DLL, the malware would need to establish a connection to its command and control server, which is described as encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections (T1071.003). Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. T1218.008 - Shared Modules
2. T1071.003 - Encrypted Command and Control

So, the final answer is: "Final Answer: T1218.008-Shared Modules".
