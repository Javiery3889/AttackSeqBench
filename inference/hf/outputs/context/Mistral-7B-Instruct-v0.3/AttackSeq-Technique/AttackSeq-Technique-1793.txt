 Final Answer: D: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline: The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents with malicious macros. This indicates that the attackers had some knowledge of their targets, which suggests they gathered victim identity information (T1589).
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the MITRE ATT&CK technique that enabled OceanLotus to target specific individuals such as vice presidents and senior directors based on their roles within the organization.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline indicates that the attackers had knowledge of their targets, which aligns best with T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information. The other answer choices do not directly relate to targeting specific individuals based on their roles within the organization.
