 Final Answer: C: T1082-System Information Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The attackers used system utilities, a backdoor, and the Windows command line to execute malicious code.
   - Persistence: The attackers created services and placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.
   - Privilege Escalation: The attackers escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
   - Defense Evasion: The attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files, hiding malware, and using rundll32.exe.
   - Lateral Movement: The attackers used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.
   - Command and Control: The attackers used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the technique most likely involved in the collection of information related to the target's system details after defense evasion (encrypting configuration files).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the attackers used system utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe for reconnaissance, as well as unknown PE files. These tools are commonly used to gather system information.
   - T1120-Peripheral Device Discovery is about discovering connected devices, not system details.
   - T1566-Phishing is the initial access vector, not a system information discovery technique.
   - T1087.001-Local Account is about creating local accounts, not system information discovery.
   - T1082-System Information Discovery is about gathering system information, which aligns best with the question and the context provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is C: T1082-System Information Discovery.
