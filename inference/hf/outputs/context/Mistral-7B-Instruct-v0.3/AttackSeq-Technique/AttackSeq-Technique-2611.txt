 To answer this question, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that involves gathering specific system details from the infected machine. The CTI outline mentions the Defense Evasion technique (T1564) where NanHaiShu uses base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file, and for the recent sample, the URL string used inside the JScript code was obfuscated in two layers. However, this technique does not directly involve system information discovery.

The Persistence technique (T1053) is about maintaining access to a system, which is not about gathering system details. The Command and Control technique (T1071) is about the communication between the malware and the C&C servers, which happens after the persistence is established.

The System Information Discovery technique (T1082) is about the collection of system information to aid in further exploitation or exfiltration. In the CTI outline, it is mentioned that the malware is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code, which can be used for exfiltration of data. This additional code may include scripts for system information discovery.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurs for gathering specific system details from the infected machine before communicating with C&C servers via dynamic DNS providers is T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: T1082-System Information Discovery.
