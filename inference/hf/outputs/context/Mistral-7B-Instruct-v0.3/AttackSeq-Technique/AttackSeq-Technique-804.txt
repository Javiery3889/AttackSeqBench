 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in the CTI outline that could lead to the execution of commands via 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Initial Access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious LNK files. Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack, which includes the execution of 'cmd' commands. However, the specific command 'cmd /c ipconfig' is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

The next step is to identify the TTPs that could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands, such as 'cmd /c ipconfig'. The Defense Evasion tactic (T1572) is mentioned, which involves renaming 'certutil.exe' to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection. This is a technique to hide the true purpose of the executable.

However, the Command and Control (C2) tactic (T1086) is more likely to be the precursor to the execution of arbitrary commands, as it involves establishing a connection to a remote server and receiving instructions. In this case, the C2 server was down at the time of analysis, but it's reasonable to assume that it would have provided the commands to be executed, which could include 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

So, the most likely TTP that occurred before the Higaisa group executed commands via 'cmd /c ipconfig' is:

1. Command and Control (T1086) - Establishing a connection to a remote C2 server and receiving instructions.

Final Answer: T1086 - Command and Control.
