 Final Answer: C: T1485-Data Destruction

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: BlackEnergy malware is used to deliver a destructive KillDisk component.
   - Command and Control: BlackEnergy communicates with C&C servers to receive instructions.
   - Others: SSHBearDoor backdoor is discovered, allowing the BlackEnergy group to access infected systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers.
   - The answer choices include techniques related to computing hijacking, data obfuscation, data destruction, and financial theft.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the BlackEnergy malware is used to deliver a destructive KillDisk component. This suggests that data destruction is a likely outcome of the attack sequence.
   - Communicating with C&C servers is a common tactic for coordinating malicious activities, but it does not directly imply any of the other techniques listed in the answer choices.
   - Data obfuscation and financial theft are not directly related to the destructive nature of the BlackEnergy malware or the KillDisk component.
   - Computing hijacking (T1496.001) is not mentioned in the CTI outline, and there is no indication that the attackers aimed to hijack computing resources for their own use.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The BlackEnergy malware communicates with C&C servers to receive instructions, and it is used to deliver a destructive KillDisk component. This suggests that data destruction (T1485) is the most likely technique that occurred after BlackEnergy communicated with its C&C servers.
