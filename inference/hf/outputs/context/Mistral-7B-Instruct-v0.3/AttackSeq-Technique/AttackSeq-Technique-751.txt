 Final Answer: A: T1573-Encrypted Channel

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The NewPass agent is responsible for exfiltrating information from the infected machine and sending it to the command-and-control server using a POST request with encrypted values (Exfiltration).
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely used to enable stealthy communication with the command-and-control server after the NewPass loader decoded the configuration file and extracted the agent component for deployment.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The question mentions stealthy communication with the command-and-control server, which aligns with the Exfiltration technique. However, the question does not explicitly state that data is being exfiltrated at this point, but rather that the agent is responsible for it later. The encrypted communication during exfiltration can be considered a stealthy method to communicate with the command-and-control server, making T1573-Encrypted Channel the most plausible answer. The other options do not directly relate to the communication between the NewPass agent and the command-and-control server after the agent is deployed. T1027.003-Steganography is related to hiding data within other data, T1568.003-DNS Calculation is about using DNS for command and control, and T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is about exfiltrating data over the command-and-control channel, but not specifically after the agent is deployed.
