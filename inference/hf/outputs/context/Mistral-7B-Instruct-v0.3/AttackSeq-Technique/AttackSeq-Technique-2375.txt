 Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives when reconnected to the system.
   - Execution: The malware operates as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware cleans up after itself and employs date sensitivity to avoid detection.
   - Collection: The malware collects data, which may be obfuscated, from connected systems and shared drives.
   - Command and Control: Command and control is accomplished via commands in an encrypted file stored on the local system.
   - Exfiltration: The means of exfiltration are not determined, but the data collection functionality suggests that data for exfiltration might be collected by the 'master' system.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the malware collecting detailed information about system properties during its reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The malware collects system information and files from connected systems and shared drives (Collection). However, this is not the reconnaissance phase as it occurs after the malware has already infected the system.
   - The malware's command and control mechanism (Command and Control) involves the collection of commands from an encrypted file, but this does not directly provide system information.
   - The malware's system information collection occurs during the Execution phase, but it is not part of the reconnaissance phase.
   - The System Information Discovery (T1082) tactic involves the collection of system properties such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, which aligns with the detailed system information the malware is collecting.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware collects system information (T1082) during its execution phase, but this is part of the reconnaissance phase as it helps the malware understand the target system better before proceeding with its main objectives.
   - Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware collected detailed information about system properties during its reconnaissance phase is T1082-System Information Discovery.
