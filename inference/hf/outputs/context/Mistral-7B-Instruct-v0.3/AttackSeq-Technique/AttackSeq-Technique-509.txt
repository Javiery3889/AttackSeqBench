 Final Answer: D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Stolen credentials and SSH tools
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through scripts, PowerShell, and custom VM-based payload loader
   - Defense Evasion: Process injection and deobfuscation
   - Discovery: Process, system information, system time, and network service scanning
   - Collection: Data archiving in a custom storage file format
   - Command and Control: SSL-encrypted communication over DNS and HTTP, capable of bypassing proxies

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique most likely used to transfer the data from the victim's system after it was archived.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using SSL-encrypted traffic over DNS and HTTP, capable of bypassing proxies. This suggests that the data could be transferred back to the attackers through the same C2 channel.
   - Answer choice A: T1052.001-Exfiltration over USB is not applicable as the data is not being transferred via USB.
   - Answer choice B: T1129-Shared Modules is not directly related to data exfiltration.
   - Answer choice C: T1590.001-Domain Properties is not related to data exfiltration.
   - Answer choice D: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel aligns best with the attack sequence and the context that the data is archived and then communicated back to the attackers through the C2 channel.
