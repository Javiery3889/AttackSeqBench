 Final Answer: D: T1057-Process Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The attackers performed basic reconnaissance on the infected host.
   - Initial Access: The attackers used a spear-phishing email to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The malware executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred when the malware started collecting information about active processes on the infected host.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware collected system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system. This information gathering is a form of reconnaissance, which is part of the MITRE ATT&CK tactic T1080 - System Information Discovery. However, the question asks about active processes, which is more specifically addressed by T1057 - Process Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malware executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code (Execution).
   - After evading detection, the malware started executing its second-stage payload (Defense Evasion).
   - The malware then collected information about active processes on the infected host (Reconnaissance - T1080). However, the question asks for the specific technique related to active processes, which is T1057 - Process Discovery. The malware's information gathering about active processes is a sub-technique of T1080, but it is more accurately described as T1057.
