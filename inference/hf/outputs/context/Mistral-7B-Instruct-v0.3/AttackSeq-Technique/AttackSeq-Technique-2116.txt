 To answer this question, we need to identify the ATT&CK technique that facilitates the acquisition and preparation of malware and other necessary components for building the malicious infrastructure, as described in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access to the server is gained through compromise or legitimate purchase, and then the software is installed, configurations are tuned, SSL certificates are registered, and files are added to the server. This process involves setting up the malicious infrastructure, which includes the malware and other necessary components.

The MITRE ATT&CK technique that best aligns with this process is T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer, which is defined as "The adversary moves tools, payloads, or exploits into the target environment." This technique is used to move the malware and other necessary components into the target environment, which is the initial step in setting up the malicious infrastructure.

Final Answer: D: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer.
