 Final Answer: A: T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access > Execution > Persistence > Discovery > Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred after the threat actor established persistence. In this case, persistence was achieved by setting the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load' registry key.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The answer choices provided are T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution, T1080-Taint Shared Content, T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs, and T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information. T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution is the technique that describes the persistence method used in this attack, where the backdoor is set to run when any user logs on. The other techniques do not directly relate to the persistence method used in this attack.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after the threat actor established persistence is T1547-Boot or Logon Autostart Execution.
