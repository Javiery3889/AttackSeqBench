 Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence starts with the compromise of Alpha's software packaging system (T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise), as the stolen code signing private key was used to sign the Kingslayer backdoor.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the technique most likely facilitating the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline indicates that the Kingslayer backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised. This suggests that the Kingslayer backdoor was deployed through a software subversion, making answer choice B the most plausible.

Answer choices A, C, and D do not align with the attack sequence or the context provided in the CTI outline. T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain and T1021.005-VNC do not involve software subversion, while T1219-Remote Access Software is not related to the deployment of malware but rather the establishment of remote access.
