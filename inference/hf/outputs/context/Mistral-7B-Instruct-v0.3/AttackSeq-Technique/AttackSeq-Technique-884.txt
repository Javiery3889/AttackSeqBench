 Final Answer: B: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing with exploits for known vulnerabilities (T1192)
   - Defense Evasion: Deployment of a module during lateral movement to scan for hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 (T1086) or accessible with admin credentials from their password database (T1078)
   - Command and Control: Establishing a sophisticated C&C infrastructure with proxy servers and over 60 domain names (T1071)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the technique employed during lateral movement in the local area network before the establishment of the C&C infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Rocra attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to scan for hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 (T1086) or accessible with admin credentials from their password database (T1078). However, T1086 is a technique for remote access, which aligns better with the question's context of infecting remote hosts during lateral movement.

4. Final Answer: The most likely technique employed during lateral movement before the establishment of the C&C infrastructure was T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, as it involves the use of known vulnerabilities in remote services to gain access to other systems, which is similar to the initial access method used in the spear phishing attack.
