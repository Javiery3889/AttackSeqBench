 Final Answer: C: T1133-External Remote Services

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics can be inferred as follows:
   - T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) or other initial access vectors were likely used to compromise the servers or gain access to them through legitimate means.
   - T1087 (Command and Control) was then employed to establish malicious infrastructure on the servers.
   - T1133 (External Remote Services) was used to configure the malicious infrastructure for Command and Control purposes.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK technique most likely to occur after threat actors acquired servers and used them to configure malicious infrastructure for Command and Control purposes.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question's sequence of TTPs is T1087 (Command and Control) and T1133 (External Remote Services). In the CTI outline, T1133 (External Remote Services) is mentioned as a technique used by threat actors to configure the malicious infrastructure they have established for Command and Control purposes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The threat actors first acquired servers (T1566.001 or other initial access vectors).
   - They then established malicious infrastructure on the servers (T1087).
   - Finally, they configured this malicious infrastructure for Command and Control purposes (T1133).
