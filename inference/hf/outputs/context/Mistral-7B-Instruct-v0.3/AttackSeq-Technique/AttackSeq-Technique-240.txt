 Final Answer: D: T1213.004-Obfuscated Files or Information

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email phishing (T1192)
   - Execution: Execution of trojanized application (T1055.001)
   - Persistence: Installation of hidden 'autoupdater' module (T1055.007)
   - Command and Control: Communication with command and control server (T1071)
   - Impact: Compromise of a cryptocurrency exchange (T1087)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the technique that helped the Lazarus group remain undetected while using a legitimate-looking application and encrypted network traffic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not directly mention a technique for obfuscation, but the trojanized Celas Trade Pro application was designed to look legitimate. The malware also used encrypted network traffic.
   - T1657-Financial Theft does not relate to the question's requirement of obfuscation.
   - T1055.012-Process Hollowing is a technique for executing malicious code within a legitimate process, but it does not directly address the obfuscation of the application or encrypted network traffic.
   - T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information is a technique for making files or information difficult to understand for unauthorized users, which aligns with the use of a trojanized legitimate-looking application.
   - T1213.004-Customer Relationship Management Software is not relevant to the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Lazarus group used a trojanized legitimate-looking application (Celas Trade Pro) to establish Initial Access. To maintain the appearance of legitimacy, they likely obfuscated the malicious code within the application, making it difficult for unauthorized users to understand the malicious intent. This aligns with the T1213.004 technique.
   - The malware also used encrypted network traffic, which further aided in remaining undetected. However, this technique is not directly associated with any specific MITRE ATT&CK technique.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is D: T1213.004-Obfuscated Files or Information.
