 To answer this question, we need to identify the technique that could allow Turla to collect files from USB drives, which is a prerequisite for lateral movement and control within the local network.

From the CTI outline, we know that Turla's PowerShell scripts are capable of collecting recent files from the local file system and files from USB drives. This collection technique is not explicitly mentioned as a separate tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but it can be inferred from the Collection tactic (T1086).

However, the question asks for a technique that occurred before Turla's RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor used plugins for lateral movement and control within the local network. Since PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control server and can execute additional PowerShell scripts, it is likely that the PowerShell scripts were already running on the compromised system before PowerStallion was deployed.

Therefore, the PowerShell scripts' collection of files from USB drives (implied by T1086) is the most likely technique that occurred before PowerStallion's lateral movement and control within the local network.

Final Answer: The technique that most likely occurred before Turla's RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor used plugins for lateral movement and control within the local network is T1086-Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell. This is an inferred answer based on the collection of files from USB drives, which is a prerequisite for lateral movement and control.
