 To answer this question, we need to find the technique that APT28 used to centralize the information they gathered during their Discovery tactic. From the CTI outline, we can see that APT28 used a Django application for administration and reporting to centralize the data from their scanning process. This aligns with the technique T1086 - Data From External Remote System, which involves using an external system to collect or exfiltrate data. However, this technique is more commonly associated with the Collection phase, not the Discovery phase.

The technique that most closely matches the action of centralizing information during the Discovery phase is T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel. While this technique is typically associated with the Exfiltration phase, it can also be used to exfiltrate data during the Discovery phase, such as when APT28 centralizes the data from their scanning process.

So, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: T1041 - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel.
