 Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: CEIDPageLock is distributed by the RIG Exploit kit and tampering with the victim's browser.
   - Persistence: The dropper saves the driver in the \Windows\Temp directory and sends the MAC address and user-id to a domain.
   - Collection: CEIDPageLock gathers browsing data on victims.
   - Command and Control: The driver connects with one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the homepage configuration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the driver connects to one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the homepage configuration.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the driver connects to the C&C servers to download the homepage configuration, which aligns with the question.
   - The answer choices provided are related to different ATT&CK techniques, but T1071-Application Layer Protocol is the technique that best describes the scenario of a malware connecting to a remote server over an application layer protocol, such as HTTP or HTTPS, to download additional malicious content.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware (CEIDPageLock) connects to one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the homepage configuration, which is an application layer communication.
   - The answer choice T1071-Application Layer Protocol best describes this scenario, as it involves the use of application layer protocols for command and control communication.
   - Therefore, the final answer is C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol.
