 To answer this question, we need to identify the techniques that could occur between the discovery phase and the exfiltration phase in the provided CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the adversary uses various discovery tools like PsLogList to extract contents of the Windows Security Event Log. After discovery, the adversary performs lateral movement, command and control, and data exfiltration.

The answer choices provided are:
1. T1056.003-Web Portal Capture
2. T1005-Data from Local System
3. T1218.014-MMC
4. T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

The technique T1056.003-Web Portal Capture involves the use of web browsers or other software to capture data from websites. This technique is not mentioned in the CTI outline, so it can be ruled out.

T1005-Data from Local System is about collecting data from local resources, which could be a possibility, but it's not specific to a certain phase between discovery and exfiltration.

T1218.014-MMC (Microsoft Management Console) is a technique used for executing commands and scripts, which could be used for various purposes, including lateral movement or data manipulation. However, it's not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline that the adversary used MMC for these purposes.

T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the technique used for exfiltrating data through the command and control channel, which is mentioned in the CTI outline as a method for exfiltrating large amounts of data. However, it's not explicitly stated that this technique is used for exfiltrating data before the custom-built tool is used.

Given the context and the sequence of events in the CTI outline, T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the least likely technique to occur before the custom-built tool is used for exfiltration. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Discovery (T1087) -> Lateral Movement (T1021) -> Command and Control (T1071) -> Custom-built tool for exfiltration (not explicitly mentioned in MITRE ATT&CK but can be inferred from the CTI outline).

However, the question asks for the technique that most likely occurred after the discovery commands and before exfiltration using a custom-built tool. Based on this, the most plausible answer would be T1021-Lateral Movement, as it is the technique that logically follows the discovery phase and precedes the command and control phase in the sequence of events described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: T1021-Lateral Movement.
