 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by the Lazarus Group as described in the CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used system utilities for reconnaissance, but no specific mention of the HTTP protocol was made.
2. Initial Access: The initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
3. Execution: Malicious code was executed using system utilities, a backdoor, and the Windows command line.
4. Persistence: The attackers created services and placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.
5. Privilege Escalation: The Lazarus Group escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
6. Defense Evasion: Various techniques were used to evade detection, but the HTTP protocol was not explicitly mentioned.
7. Discovery: The attackers collected information using system utilities, but again, no specific mention of the HTTP protocol was made.
8. Lateral Movement: The group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts and their own data encryption algorithm for lateral movement.
9. Command and Control (C2): The C2 communication was done using a self-designed encryption algorithm, but no mention of the HTTP protocol was made.

The question asks if it is likely that their malware leveraged the HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers. Based on the provided CTI outline, there is no evidence to suggest that the Lazarus Group used the HTTP protocol for C2 communication. Therefore, the answer is "No".

Final Answer: B: No.
