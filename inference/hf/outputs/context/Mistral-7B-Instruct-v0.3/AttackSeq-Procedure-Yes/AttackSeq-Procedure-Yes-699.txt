 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The Elderwood Project attackers have established command and control (C&C) servers to control compromised systems.
   - Some of the C&C domains identified include qwby.gownsman.com, wwwcnas.org, gate-usa.com, and several others.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers after deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Elderwood Project attackers have already established C&C servers.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will establish C&C servers after deploying zero-day exploits. Since the attackers have already done so, it is reasonable to assume that they would continue this tactic in the future.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Elderwood Project attackers have been known to establish C&C servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.
   - After deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access, it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will continue to establish C&C servers to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
