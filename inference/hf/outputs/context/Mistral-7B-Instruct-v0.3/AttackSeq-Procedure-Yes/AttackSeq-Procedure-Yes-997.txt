 To answer this question, let's first identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: Phishing email -> SharePoint URL -> VBS script -> JavaScript backdoor
2. Execution: JavaScript backdoor -> CARBANAK RAT
3. Privilege Escalation: PowerShell RAT
4. Discovery: Cobalt Strike, data discovery
5. Collection: Data exfiltration using SmartFTP Client
6. Command and Control: CARBANAK RAT, PowerShell RAT

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:
The question asks if it's likely that RYUK ransomware would be deployed a week later using both manual and scripted methods, which included remote code execution through WMI command execution and PsExec during the Impact phase.

However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about the deployment of RYUK ransomware or any methods related to WMI command execution or PsExec. The only malware mentioned in the outline is the CARBANAK RAT and a PowerShell RAT, but there's no indication that these were used for ransomware deployment.

Given the lack of evidence in the CTI outline, it's not possible to definitively say whether RYUK ransomware would be deployed using the mentioned methods.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
