 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of the found vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server.
   - Execution: Involves the Explosive Trojan with a main executable binary and a DLL file containing backend API calls.
   - Persistence: Explosive Trojan installs itself with various service names and paths, and uses other files and directories for tasks.
   - Defense Evasion: Explosive Trojan hides from detection tools, changes versions, and detaches suspicious API activities from the main logic file.
   - Credential Access: The Trojan leverages keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - Lateral Movement: Attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network, and newer versions contain a configurable option for USB infection.
   - Command and Control: The campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework to control the targeted systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network (Lateral Movement). However, it does not explicitly state whether they will use the Explosive Trojan for USB infection.
   - The question combines the Lateral Movement and USB Infection stages, which aligns with the sequence in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first gain initial access by scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers (Reconnaissance and Initial Access).
   - After gaining access, they use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network (Lateral Movement).
   - Although the CTI outline does not explicitly state that they will use the Explosive Trojan for USB infection, the question combines Lateral Movement and USB Infection stages, which aligns with the sequence in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

Final Answer: Yes.
