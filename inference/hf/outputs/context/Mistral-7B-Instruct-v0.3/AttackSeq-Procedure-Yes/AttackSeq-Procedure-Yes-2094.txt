 To answer this question, we need to consider the CTI outline and the information provided in the question. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers interacted with their infrastructure through a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts, but it does not explicitly state that they used a cloud service for their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using the WebDAV protocol.

The question asks if it is likely that attackers leveraged a cloud service for their C2 infrastructure using the WebDAV protocol. Since the CTI outline does not provide evidence of this specific method being used, it is not possible to definitively say whether the answer is "Yes" or "No". However, the attackers did demonstrate a high level of sophistication and adaptability, so it is not entirely implausible that they could have used a cloud service for their C2 infrastructure.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
