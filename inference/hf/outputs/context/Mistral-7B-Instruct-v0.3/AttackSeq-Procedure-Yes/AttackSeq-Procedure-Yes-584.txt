 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells (AntSword).
   - Execution: Use of AntSword webshell to run commands, upload tools including Mimikatz.
   - Defense Evasion: Use of a custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert tool for evasion.
   - Credential Access: Use of Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass the hash technique.
   - Discovery: Running commands to discover system and network details.
   - Command and Control: Use of AntSword webshell for communication and command execution.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the actors used webshells for lateral movement by dumping credentials with a Mimikatz variant and using Impacket's atexec tool.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for lateral movement (pass the hash technique). However, it does not explicitly mention the use of atexec tool for lateral movement.
   - The question does not ask about the specific tool used for lateral movement but rather if they used webshells, Mimikatz, and Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement.
   - Given that the actors used Mimikatz for credential access and Impacket tools for lateral movement (pass the hash technique), it is plausible that they could have used a webshell (AntSword) for lateral movement as well, even though the CTI outline does not explicitly mention it.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The actors initially gained access to the system through a webshell (AntSword).
   - They used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for lateral movement (pass the hash technique).
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of AntShell for lateral movement, it is plausible that they could have used it given their use of other tools for lateral movement.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the actors used webshells (including AntSword) for lateral movement to other systems by dumping credentials with a Mimikatz variant and using Impacket's atexec tool (even though the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of atexec tool for lateral movement).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
