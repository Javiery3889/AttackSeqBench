 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails deliver a Trojan dropper.
   - Execution: The malware injects malicious code into explorer.exe and loads a spying library.
   - Persistence: The malware copies itself into the System32 directory and creates a service to ensure persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware disables system and AhnLab firewalls, turns off the Windows Security Center service.
   - Collection: The malware collects keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents.
   - Command and Control: Communication occurs through a Bulgarian web-based free email server.
   - Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates collected data, including system information, user-related info, and keystrokes.
   - Others: The malware gathers information about the infected computer, including file and directory discovery, before collecting and exfiltrating stolen HWP documents.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware gathers information about the infected computer, including file and directory discovery, before collecting and exfiltrating stolen HWP documents through encrypted emails.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware collects keystrokes, directory listings, and HWP documents, which aligns with the question's requirement of gathering information about the infected computer. The malware also exfiltrates this data, which includes system information and user-related info, which can be considered as file and directory discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware, after ensuring persistence, gathers information about the infected computer, including file and directory discovery, before collecting and exfiltrating stolen HWP documents through encrypted emails. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
