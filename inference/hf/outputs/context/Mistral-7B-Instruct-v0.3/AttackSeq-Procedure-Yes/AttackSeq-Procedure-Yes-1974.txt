 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails are used as an initial point of intrusion, including further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain.
   - Reconnaissance: The CTI report does not explicitly mention reconnaissance efforts, but the context suggests that threat actors gather information about their targets to carry out phishing campaigns.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if threat actors targeting Solar Winds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that threat actors use phishing emails to gather information about their targets, which aligns with the question's focus on reconnaissance efforts.
   - The question does not mention any specific TTPs beyond reconnaissance, but the CTI outline suggests that the information gathered during the initial phishing campaign could be used for further phishing campaigns within a client's supply chain, which implies that the threat actors are indeed gathering victim organization information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline suggests that threat actors use phishing emails to gather information about their targets, which aligns with the question's focus on reconnaissance efforts.
   - The question asks if threat actors will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts, and the CTI outline indicates that they do, so the answer is "Yes".
