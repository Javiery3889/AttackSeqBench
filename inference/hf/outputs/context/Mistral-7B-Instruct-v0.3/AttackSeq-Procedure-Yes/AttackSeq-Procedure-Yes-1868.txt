 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses a malicious Word document with a DDE technique to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell, which downloads and executes encoded commands.
   - Defense Evasion: APT28 uses new techniques to bypass network defenses.
   - Command and Control: The document contacts a control server to drop the first-stage malware, Seduploader.
   - Others: Seduploader is known to create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the document creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence of the malware on the victim's system.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that APT28 is known to use Seduploader, which creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence. Since the document in the CTI outline contacts a control server to drop Seduploader, it is likely that the document will create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that APT28 uses Seduploader, which is known to create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence. Since the document in the CTI outline contacts a control server to drop Seduploader, it is likely that the document will create a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
