 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - Execution: User Execution (T1204)
   - Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), Credentials in Registry (T1214)
   - Collection: Data from Local System (T1005)
   - Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043), Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
   - Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of T1107 (File Deletion) being employed after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, there is no evidence of File Deletion (T1107) being used before or after the mentioned TTPs. The attacker's focus seems to be on initial access, execution, credential access, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attacker's actions in the CTI outline do not include File Deletion (T1107) as part of their sequence. Therefore, it is unlikely that the campaign will employ T1107 as part of defense evasion.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
