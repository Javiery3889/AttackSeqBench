 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Shamoon malware was deployed and executed as a scheduled job, entrenching itself as a service and dropping a driver for disk access.
   - Execution: Shamoon malware executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and executes the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver. The dropped driver is then loaded and executed, facilitating disk access for the malware's destructive operations.
   - Persistence: Shamoon entrenches itself as a service on the infected system.
   - Defense Evasion: Shamoon malware overwrites data within the Documents and Settings folder followed by the System32 folder, and then starts physical disk access to begin wiping at the disk level. The malware also overwrites the disk's boot records, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR), to prevent access to the affected file systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Shamoon will eventually overwrite disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that Shamoon malware overwrites the disk's boot records (MBR and VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic. This action prevents access to the affected file systems and targets both user and system data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Shamoon malware, after entrenching itself as a service for persistence and executing the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver for its destructive operations, will eventually overwrite the disk's boot records (MBR and VBR) to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data (Answer Choice A).
