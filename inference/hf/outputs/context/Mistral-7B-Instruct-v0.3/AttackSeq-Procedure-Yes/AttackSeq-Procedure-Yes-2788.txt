 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and identify the attack sequence:

1. Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (malware) is installed on compromised systems.
2. Execution: The malware runs in the background, hides its icon, and restarts when terminated on iOS 7 devices.
3. Command and Control: The malware collects information from the iOS device and sends it out via HTTP to its C&C server.

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:

The question asks if it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Comparing the attack sequence from the CTI outline with the details in the question, we can see that the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the XAgent app collects geo-location data. However, since the malware is designed to collect information from the iOS device and send it out via HTTP to its C&C server, it is plausible that geo-location data could be one of the types of information collected.

Final Answer: A: Yes. Although the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the XAgent app collects geo-location data, it is plausible that it does as part of the information it collects and sends to its C&C server.
