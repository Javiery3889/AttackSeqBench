 To answer this question, we need to look for the TTPs related to Command and Control and Exfiltration in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Infamous Chisel's db component provides SCP functionality, and td is deployed alongside the malware providing a Tor hidden service relaying connections to SSH program. The malware also provides a local Socks connection for db, and db provides a SSH server and client. This indicates that Infamous Chisel has the capability for Command and Control and potentially Exfiltration.

However, the question asks about automatically exfiltrating files at regular intervals. While the CTI outline mentions that Infamous Chisel collects files, it does not explicitly state that it automatically exfiltrates these files at regular intervals.

Given the information available, we cannot definitively say whether Infamous Chisel automatically exfiltrates these files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections. Therefore, the answer is not straightforward based on the provided CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided information.
