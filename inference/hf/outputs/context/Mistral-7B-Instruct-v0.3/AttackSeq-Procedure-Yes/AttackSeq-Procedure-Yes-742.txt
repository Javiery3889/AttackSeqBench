 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.
   - Execution: The malware downloader executed two binaries retrieved from hxxp://199[.]187[.]208[.]75/MyWS.asmx/GetUpdate?val=UID.
   - Persistence: The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware employed defense evasion by checking if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
   - Discovery: The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - Command and Control: The RAT communicated with a C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools as part of the execution phase before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware downloader executed two binaries (reconnaissance tool and RAT) as part of the execution phase (step 3).
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'. Since the execution of the binaries (including the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe') is part of the sequence in the CTI outline, it is likely that the malware downloader executed the binaries before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the malware downloader executed binaries to retrieve reconnaissance and RAT tools as part of the execution phase before conducting reconnaissance via 'bird.exe'.
