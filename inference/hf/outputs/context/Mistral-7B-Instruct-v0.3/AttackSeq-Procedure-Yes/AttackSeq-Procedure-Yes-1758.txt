 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by Shuckworm as described in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: Phishing email with a malicious document containing a custom backdoor (Pterodo)
2. Execution: Execution of VBS scripts, HTA files, additional Pterodo variants, and a VNC client
3. Persistence: Creation of scheduled tasks to execute malicious VBS files every few minutes
4. Defense Evasion: Utilization of mshta.exe and scheduled tasks to bypass security measures
5. Collection: Deployment of multiple VBS backdoor variants, but it's unclear if documents were part of the information collection effort

The question asks about the likelihood of Shuckworm establishing command and control by using HTTP requests and interacting with C&C servers before downloading additional payloads.

From the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence that Shuckworm used HTTP requests or interacted with C&C servers to download additional payloads. However, the outline does mention the use of a VNC client as the ultimate payload on July 28, which could be controlled remotely. But the question specifically asks about HTTP requests and C&C servers, so the VNC client installation does not align with the question.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that Shuckworm will establish command and control by using HTTP requests and interacting with C&C servers such as deep-pitched.enarto.ru before downloading additional payloads (Answer: No).

Final Answer: No.
