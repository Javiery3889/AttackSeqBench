 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The GroundPeony campaign has been observed establishing communication with a C&C server, but the CTI outline does not specify that the server is "app.onedrivo.com".

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the establishment of C&C communication through "app.onedrivo.com".

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that the GroundPeony campaign communicates with "app.onedrivo.com". The IoCs provided in the CTI outline include various SHA256 hashes and IP addresses/domains such as 103.199.17.184, 160.20.145.111, and *.onedrivo.com, but "app.onedrivo.com" is not listed among them.

4. Conclusion: Based on the provided CTI outline and the question, it is not likely that the GroundPeony campaign establishes C&C communication through "app.onedrivo.com". Therefore, the correct answer is B: No.
