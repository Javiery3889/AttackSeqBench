 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: The Lazarus group used malicious software, including backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), but no mention of Hermes ransomware was found.
   - Persistence: The Lazarus group established persistence on the network but did not delete Volume Shadow Copies or backup files.
   - Defense Evasion: The Lazarus group employed defense evasion tactics, but no mention of ransomware was made.
   - Lateral Movement: The Lazarus group attempted lateral movement within the network, but no ransomware was involved.
   - Command and Control: The Lazarus group's backdoor malware communicated with command and control servers and executed remote commands, but no ransomware was mentioned.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware after communicating with command-and-control servers and executing remote commands.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware by the Lazarus group during the FEIB heist.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files during the FEIB heist. The answer choice B: No is the most plausible sequence of TTPs.
