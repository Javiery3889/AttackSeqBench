 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Scripting, Batch files, VBScript, rundll32, CreateProcess, C&C servers
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry modifications, code signing, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates
   - Discovery: Automatic listing of interesting files for future exfiltration
   - Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Office documents and using Outlook VBA macro to send emails
   - Collection: Searching for sensitive documents, scanning drives for sensitive data, taking screenshots, deploying scripts
   - Command and Control: Using both HTTP and HTTPS for C&C

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's modules will automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration (Discovery). This suggests that the group has a mechanism in place to exfiltrate data, and it is likely that they will automatically upload the harvested documents to the C&C server during the exfiltration phase.

4. Final Answer: A: Yes
