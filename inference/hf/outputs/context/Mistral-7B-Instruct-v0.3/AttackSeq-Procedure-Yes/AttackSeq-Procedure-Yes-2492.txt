 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Black Energy 2 encrypts its payload and loads plugins onto the infected machine.
   - Persistence: Black Energy 2 maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe user-mode process and launching the injected library’s code using APC queue processing.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Black Energy 2 will allocate memory in the svchost.exe process and launch the injected library’s code using APC queue processing for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Black Energy 2 maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe process and launching the injected library’s code using APC queue processing.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is indeed likely that Black Energy 2 will allocate memory in the svchost.exe process and launch the injected library’s code using APC queue processing for persistence. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
