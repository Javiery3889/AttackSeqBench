 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline and match them with the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that APT28 performs Discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. However, there is no direct mention of deploying additional modules like pr.dll for data collection.

The Exfiltration stage involves APT28 exfiltrating data such as emails and files to the central server, but again, there's no mention of pr.dll being used for this purpose.

Given the information provided, it's not plausible to conclude that APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll for data collection efforts based on the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No.
