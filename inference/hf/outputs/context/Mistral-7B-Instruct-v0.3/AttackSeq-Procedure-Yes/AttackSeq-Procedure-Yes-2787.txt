 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and identify the attack sequence:

1. Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access)
2. Execution: Malware installation and persistence (running in the background, restarting after termination)
3. Discovery: Information collection and Command & Control (C&C) routines (collecting various types of data, voice recording, and Wi-Fi status)

Now, let's analyze the question and identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned:

1. Information collection (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data)
2. Performing routines (implied, as these are part of the information collection)
3. Sending information via HTTP
4. Uploading files via FTP protocol

Comparing the attack sequence from the CTI outline with the details in the question, we can see that the question mentions information collection and performing routines, which aligns with the Discovery phase in the CTI outline. However, the question does not explicitly state the order of sending information via HTTP and uploading files via FTP protocol.

Given the context that the malware is designed to collect information and perform routines on the iOS device, it is likely that the malware sends the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations. This is because sending information via HTTP is a common method for data exfiltration, while FTP is typically used for uploading files.

Final Answer: A: Yes
