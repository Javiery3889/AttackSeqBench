 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script with AMSI bypass method
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script leads to njRAT (no mention of DLL loading)
   - Persistence: VBScript in Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access using a JavaScript downloader hosted on Discord CDN.
   - It mentions PowerShell, DLL loading, AMSI bypass, and persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Blind Eagle uses PowerShell in the second stage, which includes an AMSI bypass method (Defense Evasion). However, there's no direct mention of DLL loading.
   - The persistence stage comes after the second stage (Command and Control) in the CTI outline, and it involves a VBScript in the Startup folder.
   - Since the question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access, it's reasonable to assume that the PowerShell script with the AMSI bypass method (Defense Evasion) would come before the persistence stage.
   - Therefore, it's plausible that Blind Eagle will utilize PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass before achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Yes. Blind Eagle is likely to utilize PowerShell to load DLLs and perform AMSI bypass before achieving persistence by placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute a batch file upon system startup.
