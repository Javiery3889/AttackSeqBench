 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question. The relevant TTPs for this question are Persistence, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.

From the CTI outline, we know that the Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process. However, there is no explicit mention of the Rising Sun implant fetching computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers.

The question asks about the Rising Sun implant fetching computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities. Since there is no evidence in the CTI outline to support this, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No. The Rising Sun implant does not necessarily fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
