 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Initial access in the DNSpionage campaign was attempted through malicious Microsoft Office documents via spear-phishing.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions achieving initial access through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via spear-phishing.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the initial access was indeed achieved through malicious Microsoft Office documents.
   - After initial access, the malware would need to execute its payload, which is a PE file in this case.
   - The DNSpionage malware then maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' to execute the dropped binary every minute.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the DNSpionage malware will execute a PE file before maintaining persistence.

4. Conclusion:
   - The DNSpionage malware will execute a PE file after achieving initial access through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via spear-phishing, so the answer is A: Yes.
