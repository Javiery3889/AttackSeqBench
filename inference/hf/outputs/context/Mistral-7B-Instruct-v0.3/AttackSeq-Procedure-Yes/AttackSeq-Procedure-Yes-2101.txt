 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents
   - Execution: Exploitation of old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, chain of in-memory loaders, installation of a previously unknown backdoor
   - Persistence: Creation of a scheduled task to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day
   - Defense Evasion: Anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, dynamic API resolving, and anti-sandboxing
   - Discovery: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer
   - Collection: Wide range of data collection from the victim's system
   - Command and Control: Encrypted communication with a C&C server
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration over the C&C channel
   - Others: Chinese APT group, limited daily window for C&C server activity, infrastructure details, and attribution to the Chinese threat group

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the backdoor shutting down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data.
   - Answer choice A suggests that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer, but there is no evidence to support this in the CTI outline.
   - Answer choice B correctly states that the backdoor is not likely to shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data, as there is no information in the CTI outline to suggest otherwise.
