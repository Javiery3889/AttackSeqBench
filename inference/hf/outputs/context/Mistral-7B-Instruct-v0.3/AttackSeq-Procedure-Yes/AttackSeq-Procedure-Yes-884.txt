 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing with exploits for known vulnerabilities was used to gain initial access.
   - Defense Evasion: A multi-functional framework resistant to C&C server takeover was created for defense evasion.
   - Command and Control: A complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names was used to control infected machines.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rocra attackers will use a module to scan the local network and employ admin credentials for lateral movement before leveraging their complex C&C infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Rocra attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to actively scan the local area network, find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067, or accessible with admin credentials from their password database. This aligns with the question's requirement of using a module for scanning the local network and employing admin credentials for lateral movement.
   - The question does not explicitly mention the use of the C&C infrastructure for control after lateral movement, but the CTI outline does mention that the attackers use their complex C&C infrastructure to control infected machines. It is reasonable to assume that the attackers would use their C&C infrastructure after gaining control of the network through lateral movement.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline and the question, it is likely that the Rocra attackers will use a module to scan the local network and employ admin credentials for lateral movement before leveraging their complex C&C infrastructure with over 60 domain names to control infected machines. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
