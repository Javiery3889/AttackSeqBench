 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to gain access.
   - Execution: Flash exploit 'show.swf' executes shellcode for installing a payload.
   - Others: No mention of Defense Evasion tactics before payload installation.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline does not mention any Defense Evasion tactics before the shellcode installs the payload. The question asks about Defense Evasion, but the CTI Outline does not provide evidence to support the occurrence of Defense Evasion before payload installation.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI Outline, it is not likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
