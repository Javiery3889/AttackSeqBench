 To answer this question, let's first identify the relevant attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Defense Evasion
4. Discovery
5. Lateral Movement (implied but not explicitly stated, as it follows Execution and Defense Evasion)
6. Persistence
7. Privilege Escalation
8. Command and Control
9. Exfiltration

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:
The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

Comparing the question with the attack sequence, we can see that lateral movement (moving from the initial compromised system to other systems within the network) typically occurs after the attacker has gained knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission (Discovery phase) and before installing additional persistence points (Persistence phase).

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the attack sequence, as lateral movement (moving to new systems) typically happens before installing persistence points.
B: No - This answer choice contradicts the attack sequence, as lateral movement usually occurs before installing persistence points.

Final Answer: A: Yes. After attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase, it is likely they will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
