 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers network and host configuration details using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to employ network sniffing to obtain credentials before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not indicate that FIN13 uses network sniffing to obtain credentials before performing internal reconnaissance. Instead, they use trojanized KeePass binaries for password logging during privilege escalation and native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - In the CTI outline, FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries during privilege escalation to log newly entered passwords.
   - Afterward, they perform internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware.
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to employ network sniffing before performing internal reconnaissance. However, the CTI outline does not indicate that FIN13 uses network sniffing for this purpose.
   - Therefore, the answer is B: No. FIN13 is not likely to employ network sniffing to obtain credentials before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
