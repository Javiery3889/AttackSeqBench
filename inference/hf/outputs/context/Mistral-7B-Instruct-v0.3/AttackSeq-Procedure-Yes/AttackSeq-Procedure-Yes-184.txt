 To answer this question, we need to look for the tactics related to Collection and File and Directory Discovery in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Infamous Chisel does perform Collection, specifically collecting files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and files from application and data directories containing communication data. However, there is no explicit mention of file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories before collecting files.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Since the CTI outline does not suggest that Infamous Chisel enumerates data directories before collecting files, the most plausible answer is B: No.

Final Answer: B: No.
