 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Turla malware infects government computers (Initial Access tactic).
   - Persistence: Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks (Persistence tactic).
   - Collection: Turla operators download specialized tools onto an infected system (Collection tactic).
   - Command and Control: Turla uses command and control servers to control infected systems (Command and Control tactic).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Turla will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before its operators download specialized tools during the Collection phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state whether Turla includes a rootkit for Defense Evasion. However, given that Turla is a sophisticated piece of malware used by a state-sponsored actor, it is plausible that they would use a rootkit to conceal their spying operation (Defense Evasion tactic). This would help them maintain their presence in the network undetected while they gather sensitive information (Collection tactic).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - It is likely that Turla will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before its operators download specialized tools, like password stealers, to gather sensitive information during the Collection phase. This is based on the assumption that a sophisticated state-sponsored actor like the one behind Turla would use a rootkit to maintain their presence in the network undetected while they gather sensitive information.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
