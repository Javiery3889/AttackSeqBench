 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: DLL side-loading is used to execute malicious code.
   - Defense Evasion: The APT group uses DLL side-loading to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload.
   - Exfiltration: The APT group configures the system for data exfiltration but does not mention establishing a remote command shell or connecting to a specific IP address or port for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack's final payload will establish a remote command shell and connect back to a specific IP address and port for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the establishment of a remote command shell or connecting to a specific IP address and port for command and control. The only connection-related activity mentioned is data exfiltration to a desktop.ini folder, not to a specific IP address and port.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence to suggest that the final payload will establish a remote command shell and connect back to the IP address and port specified in the question. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
