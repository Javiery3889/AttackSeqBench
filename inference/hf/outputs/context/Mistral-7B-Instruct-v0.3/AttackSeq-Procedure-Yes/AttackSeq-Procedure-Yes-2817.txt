 To answer this question, we need to consider the CTI outline and the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access was gained by delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file. However, the outline does not provide information about any obfuscation technique used before establishing communication with the C&C servers.

The question asks about the use of VMProtect for obfuscation before establishing communication with the C&C servers. Since the CTI outline does not mention the use of VMProtect, it is not possible to confirm whether the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used VMProtect for obfuscation.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
