 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - Execution: VBS macro execution upon opening the malicious Word document.
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script execution in memory, avoiding disk writing.
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers for payload download.
   - Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware downloaded and executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the campaign involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros (Reconnaissance), and it also mentions the execution of a VBS macro upon opening the malicious Word document (Execution). Therefore, it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The CTI outline provides evidence that the observed campaign involves the execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document, which aligns with the question's inquiry.
