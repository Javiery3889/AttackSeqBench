 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with Word documents containing macros.
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails with a VBS macro in a Word document.
   - Execution: VBS macro executes PowerShell script, which downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab payloads.
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory and uses DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - Impact: Payloads downloaded and executed are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab. This implies that the script communicates with C2 servers to download these payloads.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PowerShell script, after evading defenses by operating in memory and using the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk, downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. This suggests that the script communicates with C2 servers to download these payloads. Therefore, it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. Final Answer: A: Yes.
