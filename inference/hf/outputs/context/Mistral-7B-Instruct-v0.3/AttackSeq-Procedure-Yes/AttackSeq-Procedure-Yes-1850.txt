 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question: Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control.

Now, let's compare these TTPs with the attack sequence from the CTI outline: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Command and Control.

The question does not mention Defense Evasion or Discovery, but it does mention Execution (deploying the malware), Persistence (configuring itself as a scheduled task), and Command and Control (communicating with its C2 servers).

However, the question does not explicitly state whether the keylogger component is activated after the malware gains persistence. The CTI outline mentions that if any anti-virus is detected, the malware does not install its keylogger component.

So, the question is asking about a specific action (activating the keylogger) that is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline to happen after gaining persistence. Since the CTI outline mentions that the malware does not install the keylogger if any anti-virus is detected, it is less likely that the keylogger will be activated after gaining persistence.

Final Answer: No.
