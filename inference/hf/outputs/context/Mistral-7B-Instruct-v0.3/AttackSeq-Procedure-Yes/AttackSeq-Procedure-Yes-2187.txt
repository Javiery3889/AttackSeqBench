 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Earth Lusca gathered network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and tools like PowerSploit.
   - Initial Access: Earth Lusca used spear phishing emails with malicious links or watering hole attacks to achieve initial access.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Earth Lusca gathered network configurations and domain information (Reconnaissance) and then used spear phishing emails with malicious links or injected malicious JavaScript into websites (Initial Access) prior to employing command and scripting interpreters to execute malicious code.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Earth Lusca indeed performed Reconnaissance before employing Initial Access techniques. The question's sequence of TTPs aligns with the order presented in the CTI Outline.

4. The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca performed these actions, and the CTI Outline provides evidence that they did. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes".
