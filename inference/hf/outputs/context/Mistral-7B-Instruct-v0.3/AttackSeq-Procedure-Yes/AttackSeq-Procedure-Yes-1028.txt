 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Uses scripting, CreateProcess, rundll32, and user execution of malicious email attachments
   - Persistence: Registers modules as scheduled tasks, uses Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modifies registry keys, deobfuscates and decrypts strings, adds remote templates to documents
   - Discovery: Backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration
   - Lateral Movement: Injects malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and uses Outlook VBA macro for email transmission
   - Command and Control: Uses both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control
   - Exfiltration: Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server
   - Others: The group scans for sensitive documents and uses a variety of programming languages and simple tools

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Gamaredon group scans for interesting files (sensitive documents) for future exfiltration (Discovery tactic). This implies that they likely have scripts or tools to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

4. Final Answer: A: Yes, it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.
