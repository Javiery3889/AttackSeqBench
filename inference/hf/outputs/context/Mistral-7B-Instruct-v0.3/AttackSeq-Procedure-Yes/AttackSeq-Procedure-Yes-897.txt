 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Delivery of KerrDown via Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
   - Defense Evasion: VBS decode function used to decode base64 blobs, KerrDown DLL dropped in 'Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\' as 'main_background.png', DLL retrieves payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory.
   - Command and Control: Final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, downloaded from a URL depending on the OS architecture of the victim machine.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after delivering KerrDown to targets via Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of image files or base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload within the Office document. Instead, the DLL retrieves the payload from a URL and executes it in memory.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.
   - The CTI outline does not support this sequence of TTPs, as the DLL retrieves the payload from a URL and executes it in memory, not within the Office document. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
