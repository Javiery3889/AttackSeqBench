 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (Phishing email delivery of FriarFox), Defense Evasion (FriarFox browser extension execution and contacting a command and control server to retrieve Scanbox).

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will use the FriarFox extension to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline shows that the FriarFox extension, once installed, contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload. Therefore, the answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence and contextual information provided in the CTI outline.

4. Conclusion: The final answer is "Yes". The threat actors are likely to use the FriarFox extension to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload.
