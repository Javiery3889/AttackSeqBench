 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Attackers use worms and scanning tools to find vulnerable hosts.
   - Initial Access: Attackers exploit misconfigured Docker API ports to gain initial access.
   - Execution: Attackers abuse command interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries, including cryptocurrency mining scripts.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions deploying worms to scan for misconfigured hosts and exploiting exposed Docker API ports to gain initial access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that attackers will abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after gaining initial access, attackers do execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries, including cryptocurrency mining scripts (Execution).
   - The question's sequence of TTPs (deploying worms, exploiting Docker API ports, and executing cryptocurrency mining scripts) aligns with the sequence in the CTI outline.
   - The ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it is a possibility based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

4. Conclusion:
   - The question's sequence of TTPs aligns with the sequence in the CTI outline, and it is likely that attackers will abuse command interpreters to execute cryptocurrency mining scripts before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
