 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spam emails with fake updates or exploiting current events (COVID-19)
   - Persistence: Creates .LNK file in the Windows startup directory
   - Privilege Escalation: Hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking at firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks, registering binary as default handler for .MSC files
   - Defense Evasion: Hooking APIs, checking for loaded modules, killing processes, blocking at firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks, checking for debugging tools, detecting virtual environments
   - Credential Access: Steals credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook
   - Command and Control: Communicates with C&C server using RealThinClient SDK over HTTP

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook after collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Grandoreiro is indeed capable of stealing credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook (Credential Access). While the question does not explicitly mention collecting information about the computer's name, username, and installed banking protection software, it is reasonable to assume that such information could be gathered during the Initial Access and Defense Evasion stages. Therefore, it is likely that Grandoreiro will employ techniques to steal credentials after collecting the necessary information.

4. Final Answer: Yes
