 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The Lazarus group installs backdoors (BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) on several machines. These backdoors are capable of various malicious functions, including connecting to command and control servers.
   - The encrypted backdoor (Msadoz<n>.dll) is decrypted and executed in memory by a loader DLL (AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll).
   - The encrypted configuration file (Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui) contains the C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to have the backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the encrypted backdoor (Msadoz<n>.dll) is decrypted and executed in memory by a loader DLL, and the encrypted configuration file contains the C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Lazarus group will have the backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Lazarus group installs backdoors on several machines, which are capable of connecting to command and control servers. The encrypted backdoor is decrypted and executed in memory by a loader DLL, and the encrypted configuration file contains the C&C information necessary for the backdoor to connect and conduct its activities. Therefore, it is likely that the Lazarus group will have the backdoors connect to command and control servers to receive commands and conduct activities.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
