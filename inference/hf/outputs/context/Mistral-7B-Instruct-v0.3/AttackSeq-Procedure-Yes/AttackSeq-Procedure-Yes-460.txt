 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: Bankshot implants are distributed from a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform.
   - Initial Access: The attackers used spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit.
   - Execution: The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document and downloaded and executed from the malicious domain.
   - Persistence: The implant is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.
   - Defense Evasion: The implant is designed to evade detection and persist on a victim's network.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase after using the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during their reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Bankshot implants are distributed from a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform (Resource Development). This matches the question's description of distributing Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first used spear phishing emails to gain initial access (Initial Access) and execute the Bankshot implant (Execution). After collecting information on victim organizations during their reconnaissance phase, it is likely that the group would proceed to distribute Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase (Resource Development).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
