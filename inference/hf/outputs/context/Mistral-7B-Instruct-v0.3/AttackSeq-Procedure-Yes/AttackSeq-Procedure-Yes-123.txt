 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by Agrius as described in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: Exploitation of public-facing applications, including FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and SQL injection.
2. Execution: Deployment of custom malware, including the .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
3. Persistence: Deployment of webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
4. Defense Evasion: Use of obfuscated webshells and self-deleting 'IPsec Helper'.
5. Lateral Movement: Use of webshells and RDP tunneling for lateral movement.
6. Command and Control: Communication with C2 servers over HTTP.

The question asks about the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers. However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about Agrius deploying these specific malware types. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is mentioned for data exfiltration and downloading additional malware, but there is no direct evidence that it is used for data destruction activities like the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.

Final Answer: No, based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that Agrius will deploy the 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.
