 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - Execution: User Execution (T1204)
   - Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214)
   - Collection: Data from Local System (T1005)
   - Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
   - Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking about the sequence of TTPs after executing hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution. The TTPs mentioned in the question are Credential Access (T1003, T1081, T1214) and Hidden Files and Directories (T1158).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we can see that after the Execution phase, the malware searches for credentials in various registry keys and files (Credential Access). However, there is no mention of hiding files or directories (T1158) before this process.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware, after executing hidden objects in an Excel document, does not appear to hide files or directories (T1158) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - Final Answer: No.
