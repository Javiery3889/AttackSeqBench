 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by Agrius as described in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: Agrius gained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications, uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
2. Execution: Agrius deployed custom malware, including the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
3. Persistence: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
4. Defense Evasion: Agrius used webshells and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to evade defenses.
5. Lateral Movement: Agrius used webshells and RDP for lateral movement within the target network.
6. Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.

The question asks if it is likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers over HTTP and perform actions such as updating relays or downloading files.

However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about Agrius deploying wipers like 'Apostle'. The outline only mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor was used for data exfiltration and deploying additional malware. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle'.

Final Answer: No.
