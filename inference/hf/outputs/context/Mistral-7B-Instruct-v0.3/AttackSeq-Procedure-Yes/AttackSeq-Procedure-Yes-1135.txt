 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The initial access was achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered via LinkedIn messages. The document contained embedded malicious macros that initiated the infection process.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions before persistence is established via a scheduled task named "SystemFailureReporter".
3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access was achieved through malicious macros in a Microsoft Word document. The persistence was established by the initial stage macros through a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter'. Therefore, it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions before persistence is established via the scheduled task.

The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence and any critical contextual information provided in the CTI outline.
