 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.
   - Discovery: The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Rising Sun implant encrypted data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server. This matches the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
