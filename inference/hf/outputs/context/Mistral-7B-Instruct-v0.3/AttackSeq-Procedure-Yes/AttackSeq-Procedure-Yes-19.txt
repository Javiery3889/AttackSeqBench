 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we know that "Machete" malware creates a task named 'Microsoft_up' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'. However, there is no explicit mention of logging keystrokes or copying files to a special USB device for the collection of sensitive information.

The question asks if "Machete" is likely to log keystrokes and copy files to a special USB device. Since the CTI outline does not provide evidence to support these specific TTPs, we cannot definitively say whether they are part of the malware's behavior.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
