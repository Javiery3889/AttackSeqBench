 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The attack is linked to Cosmic Banker, which targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
   - Initial Access: The attack begins with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, SAT, and triggers the attack by clicking on a malicious .bat file.
   - Execution: The .bat file executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level, downloading the main malware library DLL and other services.
   - Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
   - Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
   - Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors.
   - Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download the malware and send collected data.
   - Exfiltration: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated to the cyber actors.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying a text related to an alleged data update request before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions the Cosmic Banker malware, displaying a text related to an alleged data update request, accessing Outlook information, and collecting email accounts.
   - In the CTI outline, the Cosmic Banker malware is linked to the attack, and it is confirmed that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors.
   - The question does not mention the specific steps of creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks, but these actions are part of the persistence tactic, which is confirmed in the CTI outline.
   - Therefore, the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying a text related to an alleged data update request before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Cosmic Banker malware is linked to the attack targeting Mexican financial institution users.
   - The attack begins with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, SAT, and triggers the attack by clicking on a malicious .bat file, which executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
   - This PowerShell script includes persistence features such as creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.
   - The PowerShell script also downloads the main malware library DLL, which is protected with the VMProtect packer.
   - The main malicious file accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors.
   - Therefore, after executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level and enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks, the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by displaying text related to an alleged data update request before accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts (Answer: Yes).
