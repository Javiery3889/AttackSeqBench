 To answer this question, we need to find the TTPs related to file exfiltration and compression in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Vyveva's backdoor exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041), but there is no mention of data compression with zlib (T1078) in the provided information.

The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva's backdoor will collect files from the computer before compressing them with zlib for transmission to the C&C server. Since there is no evidence in the CTI outline that Vyveva compresses files before transmission, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No.
