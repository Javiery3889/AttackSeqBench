 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: SideCopy uses decoys posing as operational documents and honeytraps.
   - Resource Development: SideCopy mimics legitimate processes and uses decoy documents.
   - Initial Access: SideCopy uses LNK files, self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables, and MSI-based installers.
   - Execution: SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - Persistence: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys for persistence.
   - Credential Access: SideCopy targets Kavach MFA app and deploys njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach.'
   - Discovery: SideCopy uses decoys posing as internal, operational documents and honeytraps.
   - Collection: SideCopy uses modular plugins for specific malicious tasks, including file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - Command and Control: SideCopy uses fake websites or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - Exfiltration: SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.
   - Others: SideCopy mimics legitimate processes and uses decoy documents.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to employ tactics to evade detection by mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that SideCopy uses decoys posing as operational documents and honeytraps as part of their tactics, which aligns with the question's requirement of mimicking legitimate processes or using decoy documents.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - SideCopy has been observed using decoys posing as operational documents and honeytraps in various stages of their attack, including Reconnaissance, Discovery, and Resource Development. This indicates that they are likely to continue using these tactics to evade detection, making answer choice A: Yes, the most plausible.
