 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Tropic Trooper exploited security flaws in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to gain initial access and download an installer package (.msi).
   - Execution: The installer dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and a malicious loader (in"C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"). The loader injected a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
   - Persistence: The backdoor will load an encrypted configuration file and use SSL to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.
   - Defense Evasion: Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection, as the malicious wab32res.dll was loaded by a benign file, sidebar.exe.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Tropic Trooper's backdoor (TClient) will use SSL to connect to its C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the backdoor (TClient) will load an encrypted configuration file and use SSL to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers during the Persistence phase.
   - Therefore, it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

4. Final Answer: Yes.
