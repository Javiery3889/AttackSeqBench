 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Data collection for exfiltration.
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
   - Execution: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, delete files.
   - Persistence: Backdoor from Command and Control Server.
   - Defense Evasion: Minimize detection opportunities.
   - Credential Access: Compromised Domain Administrator credentials.
   - Discovery: Used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
   - Lateral Movement: Moved laterally across the infrastructure.
   - Collection: Collected potentially valuable documents.
   - Command and Control: Used Cobalt Strike beacon for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: Prepared documents for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After the attackers used domain administrative credentials obtained during credential access to compromise additional endpoints through discovery, the question asks if it is likely that they aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers first compromised the Domain Administrator account (Credential Access) and then used it to discover and compromise additional endpoints (Discovery). This sequence suggests that they aimed to find admin-level credentials before moving across the infrastructure.

4. Final Answer: Yes. The sequence of events in the CTI outline indicates that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.
