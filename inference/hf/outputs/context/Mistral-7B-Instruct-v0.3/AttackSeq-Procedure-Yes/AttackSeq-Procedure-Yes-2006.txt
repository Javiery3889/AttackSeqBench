 Final Answer: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Reconnaissance
     - Initial Access
     - Credential Access
     - Discovery
     - Lateral Movement
     - Command and Control
     - Impact

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, after the Initial Access (installation of BlackEnergy 3), the next step is Command and Control (Establish CC Connection). This step involves the malware establishing a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to attacker-controlled CC server. This connection is established as part of the execution routine following installation of the malicious files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that after the Initial Access (installation of BlackEnergy 3), the next step is Command and Control (Establish CC Connection). This connection is established as part of the execution routine following installation of the malicious files.
   - Since the question asks if it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution, the answer is yes, as this is exactly what happens in the sequence described in the CTI outline.
