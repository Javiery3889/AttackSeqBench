 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: FamousSparrow developed resources by exploiting known vulnerabilities and acquiring infrastructure.
   - Initial Access: FamousSparrow gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.
   - Execution: FamousSparrow executed commands to download and install SparrowDoor.
   - Persistence: FamousSparrow created a registry Run key entry and installed it as a service for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: FamousSparrow employed techniques to evade detection, including injecting shellcode and obfuscating files.
   - Credential Access: FamousSparrow used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - Discovery: SparrowDoor collected system information, including usernames, computer names, and file attributes.
   - Command and Control: SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server and exfiltrated data.
   - Exfiltration: FamousSparrow exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase in the CTI outline shows that SparrowDoor collects system information, including file attributes. This suggests that FamousSparrow has the capability to read file contents, as file attributes are not typically collected without reading the file content.
   - The Exfiltration phase shows that FamousSparrow exfiltrates data over the C&C channel. Given that they have collected file attributes, it is likely that they will read file contents before exfiltrating them.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.
