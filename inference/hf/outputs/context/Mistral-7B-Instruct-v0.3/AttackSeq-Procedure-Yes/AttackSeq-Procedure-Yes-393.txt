 To answer this question, we need to determine if the TTPs related to file collection and exfiltration are present in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Vyveva's backdoor can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), but there is no mention of collecting files from newly inserted removable media or compressing the collected files before sending them to the C&C server.

The exfiltration TTP (T1041) is present, but it only mentions that Vyveva exfiltrates data to its C&C server, not specifically files from removable media.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that Vyveva's backdoor collects files from newly inserted removable media, compresses them, and notifies the C&C about these files before sending them to the C&C server.

Final Answer: No.
