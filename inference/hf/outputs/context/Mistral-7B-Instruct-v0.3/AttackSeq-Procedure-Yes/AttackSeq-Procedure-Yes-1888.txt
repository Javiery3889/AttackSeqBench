 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 targets specific industries and has a long-term focus on financial, retail, and hospitality sectors.
   - Initial Access: FIN13 deploys web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - Execution: FIN13 uses JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
   - Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses common privilege escalation techniques like ProcDump, Mimikatz, certutil, and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities.
   - Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.
   - Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 will gather information on services before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells after obtaining credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses system service discovery as part of their reconnaissance phase, but it does not specify that they perform this action after obtaining credentials. However, the question asks about a specific sequence of events after obtaining credentials.
   - The CTI outline also shows that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, which aligns with the question's focus on moving laterally in the network.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services and move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells after obtaining credentials.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries, FIN13 may have already performed system service discovery during their reconnaissance phase. However, the question asks about a specific sequence of events after obtaining credentials.
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement, which aligns with the question's focus on moving laterally in the network.
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services and move laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells after obtaining credentials.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
