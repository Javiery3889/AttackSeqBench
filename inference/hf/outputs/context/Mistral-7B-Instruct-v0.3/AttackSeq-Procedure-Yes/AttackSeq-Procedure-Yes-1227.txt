 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Reconnaissance -> Execution -> Persistence -> Defense Evasion -> Discovery -> Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline shows that the Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process, with the first stage gathering information and the second stage delivering a remote template to execute the payload (POWERSHOWER). The question asks about the sequence of these two stages. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence and the context that the remote templates are detected by Palo Alto Networks' Wildfire. Therefore, it is likely that the Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.

4. Conclusion: Final Answer: Yes. The Inception attackers are likely to exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities.
