 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Heap spray attack and shellcode injection, downloading a secondary payload from a server.
   - Execution: Two-stage installation, installing the payload as a service, deleting the first service, and registering a second service.
   - Persistence: Installing itself as a service under random names and modifying registry keys.
   - Defense Evasion: Modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL, loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process, and deleting itself.
   - No information about communication over port 443 or a weak custom encryption scheme is provided in the CTI outline.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about communication with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the communication method or encryption scheme used by the Aurora malware. However, the lack of information about communication over port 443 and a weak custom encryption scheme suggests that it is unlikely that the Aurora malware will communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the communication method or encryption scheme used by the Aurora malware. The question asks about communication over port 443 and a weak custom encryption scheme, but the CTI outline does not mention these details. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Aurora malware will communicate with C&C servers over port 443 using a weak custom encryption scheme. Final Answer: B: No.
