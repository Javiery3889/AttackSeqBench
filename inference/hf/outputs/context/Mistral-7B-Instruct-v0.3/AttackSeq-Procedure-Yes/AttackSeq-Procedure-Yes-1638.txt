 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: SUNSPOT malware inserts the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds.
   - Discovery: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery tactic in the CTI outline shows that SUNSPOT monitors for MsBuild.exe, which is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio development tools. This suggests that SUNSPOT is targeting the Orion source code, which is built using Visual Studio tools.
   - The Execution tactic in the CTI outline shows that SUNSPOT inserts the SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion source code.
   - Therefore, it is likely that after discovering the Orion source code build (Discovery), SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. SUNSPOT will likely modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.
