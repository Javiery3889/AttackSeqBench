 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of a SharePoint vulnerability to install webshells.
   - Execution: Running commands on the compromised server for system and user discovery, uploading tools.
   - Defense Evasion: Using a custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - Credential Access: Dumping credentials and using Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - Lateral Movement: Moving laterally to other systems on the network using dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool.
   - Command and Control: Communicating with the compromised server and running commands using AntSword webshell and Shell Manager.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will execute commands to discover system network configuration on the compromised server before using lateral movement techniques.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the threat actors first executed commands on the compromised server for system and user discovery (Execution phase). This includes discovering the network configuration of the compromised server.
   - Lateral Movement techniques were used after Credential Access, which involved dumping credentials and using Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The threat actors first discovered the system network configuration on the compromised server during the Execution phase before using lateral movement techniques involving dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool. Therefore, it is likely that they will execute commands to discover system network configuration on the compromised server before using lateral movement techniques.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
