 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attackers demonstrated Resource Development capabilities, including parking domains for future use (T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the attackers parked domains for future use before using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attackers parked domains for future use (T1583.001) is part of the Resource Development tactics, which occurred before the Execution (T1072 Software Deployment Tools, T1569 System Services) and Command and Control (T1071 Application Layer Protocol, T1568 Dynamic Resolution) tactics that would involve the use of a compromised software update.

4. Conclusion:
   - The attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts, which occurred before the use of a compromised software update as their initial access vector. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
