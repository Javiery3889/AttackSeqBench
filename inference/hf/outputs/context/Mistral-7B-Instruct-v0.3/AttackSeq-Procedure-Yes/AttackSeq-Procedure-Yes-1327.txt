 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits
   - Execution: Uses a loader to execute the malware
   - Persistence: Creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service for persistence
   - Credential Access: Steals various types of credentials, including Windows credentials and software-specific credentials
   - Discovery: Searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives
   - Collection: Collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer
   - Command and Control: Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking about the sequence of TTPs related to the Collection and Exfiltration phases. Specifically, it asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase. It also uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware during the Command and Control phase. Since the question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase, the answer is yes, as this behavior is observed in the Command and Control phase of the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that CosmicDuke collects information during the Collection phase and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data during the Command and Control phase. The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase. Since the CTI outline shows that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data, and the question asks if it uses stored login credentials and contacts live remote sites, the answer is yes, as this behavior is observed in the Command and Control phase of the CTI outline.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
