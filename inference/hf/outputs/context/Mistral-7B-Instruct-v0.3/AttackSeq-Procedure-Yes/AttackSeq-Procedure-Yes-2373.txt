 To answer this question, we need to compare the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

The question mentions the functions GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName for system network configuration discovery. However, these functions are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

On the other hand, the CTI outline clearly states that after obtaining administrative rights, LightNeuron collects all emails matching specific rules and exfiltrates them through an email C&C channel encrypted using AES. This sequence aligns with the question's description of email collection and exfiltration.

The CTI outline does not provide any information about system network configuration discovery before email collection and exfiltration, so there's no evidence to suggest that LightNeuron would execute the functions GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName in this sequence.

Final Answer: No.
