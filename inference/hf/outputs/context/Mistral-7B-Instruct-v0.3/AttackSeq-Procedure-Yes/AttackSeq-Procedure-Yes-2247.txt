 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: SideCopy uses decoys posing as operational documents, honeytraps, and clones legitimate websites to serve malicious content. They have a particular interest in Kavach and deploy njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
   - Initial Access: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables, and MSI-based installers as part of their infection techniques.
   - Execution: SideCopy deploys a variety of RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - Persistence: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers to maintain persistence on infected systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to deliver final payloads and establish initial access to victim systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that SideCopy indeed uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their infection techniques (Initial Access) and also uses these methods to maintain persistence (Persistence). This sequence aligns with the question's requirements.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their infection techniques to establish initial access to victim systems (Initial Access). They also use these methods to maintain persistence on infected systems (Persistence). Therefore, before targeting Kavach, SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to deliver final payloads and establish initial access to victim systems (Answer: Yes).
