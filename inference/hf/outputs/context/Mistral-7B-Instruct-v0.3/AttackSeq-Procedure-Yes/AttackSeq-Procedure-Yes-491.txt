 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Watering hole attack on iOS users in Hong Kong, exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to download lightSpy malware.
   - Execution: lightSpy malware installs a modular backdoor for remote command execution and file manipulation.
   - Defense Evasion: lightSpy malware uses a modular design, including module updates, remote command dispatch per module, and complete shell command execution.
   - Collection: lightSpy malware collects and exfiltrates a wide range of data, including hardware information, contacts, browser history, and messenger app data like WeChat, QQ, and Telegram.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of lightSpy malware leveraging hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the lightSpy malware has a modular design, including capabilities for module updates and remote command dispatch per module. This suggests that it may use hardcoded C&C server locations for updates and data exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The lightSpy malware, after collecting data, is likely to use hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light. This is based on the malware's modular design and the capability for remote command dispatch per module. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
