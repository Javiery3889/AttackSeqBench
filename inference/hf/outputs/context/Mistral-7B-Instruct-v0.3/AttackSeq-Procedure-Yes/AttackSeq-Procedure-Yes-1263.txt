 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - Execution: PowerShell scripts with obfuscation techniques, including an AMSI bypasser and a .NET portable executable.
   - Persistence: VBScript placed in the Startup folder to ensure execution of batch files upon system startup.
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script leading to njRAT, a remote access tool (RAT) for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Blind Eagle will use PowerShell scripts with obfuscation techniques for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Blind Eagle indeed uses PowerShell scripts with obfuscation techniques (AMSI bypasser DLL and obfuscated registry key value) before placing a VBScript (Login1.vbs) in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files (SystemLogin.bat).

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI Outline and Question, it is likely that Blind Eagle will use PowerShell scripts with obfuscation techniques for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
