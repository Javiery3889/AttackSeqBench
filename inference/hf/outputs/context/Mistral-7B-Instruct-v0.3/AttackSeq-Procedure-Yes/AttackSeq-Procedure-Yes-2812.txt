 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

1. Initial Access: SSH access obtained and wget used to download malware.
2. Execution: Malware (Derusbi) loaded into memory and drops Turbo LKM.
3. Persistence: Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes.
4. Defense Evasion: Derusbi and Turbo LKM employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques.
5. Discovery: Derusbi gathers system information and beacons it to the command and control infrastructure via network beacons.

The question asks about the C2 interactions, specifically whether HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and including HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions is likely.

From the CTI outline, there is no information about the specific method of communication used by the Derusbi malware for C2 interactions. However, the use of port 443 suggests that the communication might be encrypted, which could be considered as a form of obfuscation. But there is no mention of the specific URL pattern /photos/photo.asp in the CTI outline.

Given the lack of information about the specific URL pattern and the fact that the CTI outline does not indicate the use of HTTP POST requests, it is not possible to definitively say whether the Derusbi malware employs HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and includes HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp in its C2 interactions.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
