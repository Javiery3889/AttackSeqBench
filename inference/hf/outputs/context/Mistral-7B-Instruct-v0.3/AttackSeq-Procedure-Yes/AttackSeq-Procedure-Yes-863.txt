 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework for espionage and reconnaissance purposes.
   - Initial Access: GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromises public-facing web servers to gain access to targeted systems.
   - Persistence: GreyEnergy wipes malware components from victims' hard drives to cover their tracks.
   - Defense Evasion: GreyEnergy employs stealth techniques to hinder analysis and detection.
   - Credential Access: GreyEnergy uses various tools for credential access.
   - Lateral Movement: GreyEnergy deploys internal C&C proxies within victims' networks to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server, facilitating stealthy communication.
   - Command and Control: GreyEnergy's internal C&C proxies redirect requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server on the internet.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that GreyEnergy will proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that GreyEnergy is using their malware framework for espionage and reconnaissance purposes. They have also demonstrated the ability to move laterally within networks (Lateral Movement). Deploying internal C&C proxies within victims' networks (Command and Control) allows GreyEnergy to maintain control over infected nodes and potentially access ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering.

4. Final Answer:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that GreyEnergy will proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts (Answer Choice A).
