 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by TG1021 as described in the CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
2. Discovery: TG1021 used these tools to scan and map targets, but they were loaded directly into memory without writing the binary on the disk.

The question asks about the Lateral Movement phase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that TG1021 might use the gathered information from the Discovery phase to move laterally within the network.

The Lateral Movement tactic often involves accessing shared folders on internal systems, such as servers, over SMB. However, the CTI outline does not provide evidence that TG1021 used SMB for lateral movement. Instead, TG1021 used a web shell (NodeIISWeb web shell loader) to maintain persistence and establish command and control.

Therefore, it is less likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

Final Answer: No.
