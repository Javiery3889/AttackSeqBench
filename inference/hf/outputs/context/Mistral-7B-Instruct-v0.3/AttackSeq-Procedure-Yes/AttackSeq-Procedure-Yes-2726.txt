 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing emails were used for reconnaissance.
   - Initial Access: Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - Execution: The malware, ThreatNeedle, was executed in memory after the initial access.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Lazarus gained initial access to the victim's network through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document and achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Lazarus indeed gained initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document (Initial Access) and executed the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory (Execution).

4. Conclusion:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Lazarus performed these actions, and the CTI outline confirms that they did. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
