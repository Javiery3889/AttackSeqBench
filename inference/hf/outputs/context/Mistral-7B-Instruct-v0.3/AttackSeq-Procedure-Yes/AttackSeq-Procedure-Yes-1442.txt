 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing email sent to targets.
   - Initial Access: Delivery of Taidoor malware via email attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158 in Microsoft Office.
   - Execution: Taidoor malware begins to beacon to a command-and-control (CnC) server.
   - Command and Control: Taidoor communicates with two CnC servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw) using a modified traffic pattern.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Taidoor has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012, including modifying its network traffic pattern for communication with CnC servers. This suggests that Taidoor has already evolved to avoid detection in the past and is likely to continue doing so.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Taidoor malware has demonstrated a history of tactical changes, including modifying its network traffic pattern for communication with CnC servers. This suggests that it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw) using a modified traffic pattern.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
