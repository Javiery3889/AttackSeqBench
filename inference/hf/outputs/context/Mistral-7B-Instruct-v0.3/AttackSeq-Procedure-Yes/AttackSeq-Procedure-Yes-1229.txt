 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
   - Initial Access: They exploit a year-old Office vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to gain initial access.
   - Execution: They deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
   - Persistence: POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.
   - Defense Evasion: They use anti-forensics techniques and a basic backdoor as a first stage.
   - Discovery: POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server, the question asks if it is likely to communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server, which aligns with the question's description of communication with the C2 server.
   - The question does not specify a communications loop, but the CTI outline does not contradict the possibility of a loop, as POWERSHOWER is set up to maintain persistence and potentially run a secondary payload, which could involve further communication with the C2 server.

4. Conclusion:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the actions of POWERSHOWER, which collects system information, sends it to the C2 server, and sets up persistence, suggesting that it is likely to communicate with the C2 server and potentially enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
