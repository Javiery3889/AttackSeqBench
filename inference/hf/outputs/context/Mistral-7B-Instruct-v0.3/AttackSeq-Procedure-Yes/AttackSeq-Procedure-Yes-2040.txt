 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: The attackers created fake personas and a fictitious news organization.
   - Initial Access: The attackers used social media platforms to send spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to capture credentials.
   - Reconnaissance: The campaign focused on credential harvesting and reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Iranian threat actors will connect with US officials on social media during the Reconnaissance phase before using spear-phishing messages for Initial Access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers established connections on social media during the Resource Development phase, which aligns with connecting with US officials on social media.
   - The attackers then used these connections for Reconnaissance, which includes harvesting credentials, and later for Initial Access by sending spear-phishing messages.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, it is likely that Iranian threat actors will connect with US officials on social media during the Reconnaissance phase before using spear-phishing messages for Initial Access. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
