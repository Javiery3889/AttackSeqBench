 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (Exploit: CVE-2014-1776), Execution (Arbitrary Code Execution), Persistence (Shellcode downloads the next stage of the payload), Defense Evasion (Runtime ROP generation to bypass ASLR and DEP protections, and possibly EMET's EAF mitigation).

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the attacker has leveraged corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access and executed shellcode to make memory executable.

3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, the attacker uses a Flash exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and executes shellcode to make memory executable. Then, the attacker bypasses ASLR and DEP protections and possibly EMET's EAF mitigation as part of defense evasion. Therefore, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation.

4. The question asks if it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation. The answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with the attack sequence and the context that the attacker uses a technique to bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes.
