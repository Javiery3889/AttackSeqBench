 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline and the question:

CTI Outline:
1. Initial Access (exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802)
2. Initial Access (downloading and installing an MSI package)
3. Defense Evasion (DLL hijacking, dropping files, creating hidden directories)
4. Command and Control (using SSL to connect to C&C server)
5. Persistence (loading and decrypting an encrypted configuration file)

Question:
1. Initial Access (exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor and downloading an MSI package)
2. Execution of a backdoor installer
3. Preparation for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe
4. Persistence (loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers)

Comparing the sequences, we can see that the question includes an additional step "Preparation for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe" which is not present in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is not likely that the system will drop a backdoor installer and prepare for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe before the backdoor achieves persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.

Final Answer: B: No.
