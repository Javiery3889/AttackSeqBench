 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: WinDealer steals information from SNS applications and saves it as ".a" files in the %TEMP% directory.
   - Discovery: WinDealer discovers information about the infected PC, including data from SNS applications.
   - Collection: WinDealer collects data from SNS applications and processes it into ".a" files.
   - Exfiltration: WinDealer encrypts the stolen data using AES and sends it to a C2 server from the %TEMP% directory.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will steal information from SNS applications and encrypt this data using AES before communicating with C2 servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly shows that WinDealer steals information from SNS applications, encrypts it using AES, and sends it to a C2 server. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

4. The question does not mention the use of non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556, so it is not necessary to consider these ports in the evaluation. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the ports used by WinDealer for communication with C2 servers, so it cannot be definitively stated that WinDealer does not use non-standard ports.
