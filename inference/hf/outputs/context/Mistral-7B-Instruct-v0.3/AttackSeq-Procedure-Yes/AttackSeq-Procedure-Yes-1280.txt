 To answer this question, we need to analyze the sequence of events in the CTI outline and compare it with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access is achieved by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package. However, the outline does not explicitly state that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper are executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Initial Access (exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package)
2. Malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper are executed
3. Backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL

In the CTI outline, the initial access and the installation of the MSI package are clearly stated, but the execution of the malicious documents hosting the dropper is not explicitly mentioned before the backdoor establishes persistence. Therefore, it is not likely that the malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence.

Final Answer: No.
