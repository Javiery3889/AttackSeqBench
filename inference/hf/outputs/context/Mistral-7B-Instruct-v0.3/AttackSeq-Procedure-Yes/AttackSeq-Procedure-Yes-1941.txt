 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack, infecting macOS through trojanized 3CX software.
   - Execution: The malware executes as part of the 3CDI software and creates a new thread to run its functionality.
   - Persistence: The malware persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware employs several techniques to evade detection, but it does not explicitly mention exfiltration via HTTP GET request.
   - Discovery: The malware collects information from the victim machine.
   - Collection: The malware stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, exfiltrates data using a HTTP GET request. Instead, it collects data and sends it in beacons or exfiltration, but the method of transmission is not specified.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request (Answer: B). The malware uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation and communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, but the method of data transmission for the second-stage payload is not explicitly stated.
