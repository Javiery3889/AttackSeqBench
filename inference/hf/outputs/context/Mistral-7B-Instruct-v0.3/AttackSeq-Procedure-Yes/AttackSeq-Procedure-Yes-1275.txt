 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Macro-enabled template files are used for initial access.
   - Persistence: The malicious template and macro maintain persistence by replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template.
   - Defense Evasion: The use of macro-enabled template files disrupts analysis efforts by staging various parts of the infection chain remotely.
   - Credential Access: Yellow Garuda has a history of extensive credential harvesting via dedicated phishing sites and a Telegram 'grabber' tool.
   - Collection: The Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts and stores the exfiltrated data in SQLite database and JSON format.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the format in which the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool is stored after exfiltration.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Telegram 'grabber' tool collects data in SQLite database and JSON format.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts and stores the exfiltrated data in SQLite database and JSON format. Therefore, it is likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format (Answer Choice A).
