 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables
   - Execution: Malware TDrop2 used process hollowing to inject malicious code
   - Defense Evasion: Malware TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its payload
   - Discovery: Malware TDrop2 performed discovery activities, including gathering system information and network views

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware TDrop2 used process hollowing for execution and later performed discovery activities. Therefore, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing before engaging in discovery activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware TDrop2 used process hollowing for execution to evade detection, as stated in the CTI outline. After execution, the malware performed discovery activities, including gathering system information and network views. Therefore, it is likely that the malware TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views. Final Answer: Yes.
