 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used Telegram channels to distribute Raccoon stealer and bypass blocking of active C&C servers.
   - Execution: The Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers, crypto wallet data, and configuration files.
   - Command and Control: The Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase. The question asks if it is likely that Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The answer choice "Yes" best aligns with the attack sequence and contextual information provided in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Raccoon stealer collects data during the Execution phase and communicates with C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase. To bypass blocking and ensure Defense Evasion, it is likely that the Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers before communicating with these C&C servers.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
