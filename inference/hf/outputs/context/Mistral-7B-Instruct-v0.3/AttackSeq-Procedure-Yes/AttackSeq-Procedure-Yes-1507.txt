 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The spear phishing document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to create a decoy document and a malware dropper named exp1ore.exe, which drops wab.exe and a malicious DLL, wab32res.dll, in the temp folder.
   - Execution: The malware manually loads the malicious DLL into memory, avoiding detection from DLL listings.
   - Persistence: The malware registers as a Windows service for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including Google Docs redirection, cryptographic functions, and in-memory-only presence.
   - Command and Control: The malware uses Google Docs for secure communication and employs a custom Base64 map and a salted digital thumbprint for secure callbacks.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the spear phishing document will exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop malicious components such as wab.exe and wab32res.dll for achieving initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the spear phishing document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop the malware dropper exp1ore.exe, which in turn drops wab.exe and wab32res.dll. This sequence aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The spear phishing document is used to exploit CVE-2012-0158, which leads to the dropping of the malware dropper exp1ore.exe. This dropper then drops wab.exe and wab32res.dll. Therefore, it is likely that the spear phishing document will drop these malicious components for achieving initial access.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
