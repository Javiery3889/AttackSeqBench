 To answer this question, we need to consider the CTI outline and the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that CosmicDuke targets a variety of software to steal credentials, including various email clients, web browsers, and Windows credentials. However, there is no explicit mention of CosmicDuke using keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers.

The question asks about the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. Since the CTI outline does not provide evidence of CosmicDuke using these specific tools, the most plausible answer would be:

Final Answer: No.
