 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the adversary uses email phishing (T1566) to deliver a malicious PDF (T1566.001) containing a link to ENVYSCOUT. However, there is no mention of the adversary using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts or VPSs to host malware C2s.

The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers or VPSs during the Resource Development phase. Since the CTI outline does not provide any information suggesting the use of these resources, it is not likely that the adversary will use compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts or VPSs to host malware C2s during the Resource Development phase.

Final Answer: No.
