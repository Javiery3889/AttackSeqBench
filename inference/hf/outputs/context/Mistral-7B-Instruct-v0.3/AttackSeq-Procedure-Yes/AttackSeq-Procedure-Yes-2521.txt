 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: BlueDelta performed reconnaissance activities using scripts in Roundcube webmail software.
   - Initial Access: BlueDelta gained initial access by exploiting Roundcube mail servers and Microsoft Outlook.
   - Execution: BlueDelta executed malicious scripts through Roundcube and Outlook exploits.
   - Defense Evasion: BlueDelta used obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.
   - Credential Access: BlueDelta accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube webmail software.
   - Collection: BlueDelta collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.
   - Command and Control: BlueDelta used web protocols for command and control activities.
   - Exfiltration: BlueDelta exfiltrated data over alternative protocols.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that BlueDelta will perform discovery activities, including system information and network connections discovery, before collecting emails.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that BlueDelta performed reconnaissance activities using scripts in Roundcube webmail software, which includes discovery activities such as system information and network connections.
   - The question's sequence of TTPs (discovery activities, collection) aligns with the reconnaissance phase in the CTI Outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The BlueDelta campaign accessed credentials and then performed discovery activities using Roundcube webmail software. After discovery, they collected emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin. Therefore, it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign will exploit vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to perform discovery activities before collecting emails.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
