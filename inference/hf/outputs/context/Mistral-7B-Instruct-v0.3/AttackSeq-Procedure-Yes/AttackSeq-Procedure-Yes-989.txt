 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Komplex Binder -> Komplex Dropper -> Komplex Payload
   - Execution: XAgent's BootXLoader
   - Persistence: Komplex Dropper, XAgent's Launcher
   - Defense Evasion: Komplex Binder, XAgent's BootXLoader
   - Credential Access: XAgent's Password module
   - Discovery: XAgent's InfoOS, RemoteShell modules
   - Collection: XAgent's FileSystem module
   - Command and Control: Communication between XAgent and C&C servers (selecting a C&C server, sending a hello message, starting communication threads, using HTTPChannel)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking about the sequence of events before XAgent exfiltrates information to the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions sending a hello message and starting communication threads to manage incoming commands and outgoing data, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic in the CTI outline.
   - The sequence of events in the question (sending a hello message and starting communication threads) is part of the communication process between XAgent and the C&C servers, as described in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if XAgent will establish communication with the C&C server by sending a hello message and starting communication threads to manage incoming commands and outgoing data.
   - According to the CTI outline, XAgent does establish communication with the C&C server by sending a hello message and starting communication threads (two main communication threads: one for receiving commands and one for sending data).
   - Therefore, it is likely that XAgent will establish communication with the C&C server by sending a hello message and starting communication threads, as described in the question.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
