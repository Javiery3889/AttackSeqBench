 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations, specifically Turkish financial systems.
   - Initial Access: Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The malicious Word document downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.
   - Persistence: The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.
   - Defense Evasion: The implant contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to evade detection.
   - Command and Control: The implants communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Bankshot implant is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation and contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to evade detection. This aligns with the tactic of Resource Development, which includes developing tools, techniques, and procedures to maintain and expand an adversary's capabilities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Bankshot implant is designed to persist on a victim's network and contains functionality to wipe files, which aligns with the tactic of Resource Development. Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system. Final Answer: A: Yes.
