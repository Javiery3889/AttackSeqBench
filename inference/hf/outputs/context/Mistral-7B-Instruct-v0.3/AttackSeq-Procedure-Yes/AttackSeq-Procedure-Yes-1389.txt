 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used Telegram channels to distribute Raccoon stealer.
   - Execution: The Raccoon stealer collects data and gains access to configuration files.
   - Defense Evasion: The Raccoon stealer makes network requests to a Telegram channel to receive the encrypted address of a new C&C server, bypassing blocking.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Raccoon stealer will communicate with C&C servers using Telegram to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Raccoon stealer makes network requests to a Telegram channel to receive the encrypted address of a new C&C server, which is a form of communication with C&C servers using Telegram.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Raccoon stealer, after using obfuscation techniques and downloading payloads with loaders, communicates with C&C servers using Telegram to receive the encrypted address of a new C&C server, bypassing blocking. Therefore, it is likely that the Raccoon stealer will communicate with C&C servers using Telegram to evade detection. (Final Answer: A: Yes)
