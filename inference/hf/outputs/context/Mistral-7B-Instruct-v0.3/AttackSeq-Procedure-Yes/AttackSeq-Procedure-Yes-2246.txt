 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: SideCopy targets government personnel in India, using decoys and honeytraps, with a particular interest in Kavach.
   - Resource Development: SideCopy mimics infection chains and focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - Initial Access: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, RAR-based dropper executables, and MSI-based installers for infection.
   - Execution: SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - Persistence: SideCopy uses various techniques to maintain persistence, including malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - Defense Evasion: SideCopy employs tactics to avoid detection, such as using decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimicking legitimate processes, with a particular interest in evading Kavach.
   - Discovery: SideCopy uses themes to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent and uses honeytraps.
   - Collection: SideCopy utilizes modular plugins for specific malicious tasks, such as file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging. They have developed new RAT families and plugins.
   - Command and Control: SideCopy uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - Exfiltration: SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting Kavach, and they use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that SideCopy has a particular interest in targeting Kavach and uses GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltration during the exfiltration phase. The question asks about the credential access tactic, which is closely related to the collection phase where SideCopy deploys modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging. Since SideCopy's focus on Kavach and GoLang-based file recon plugins for exfiltration is evident in both the collection and exfiltration phases, it is reasonable to assume that they would continue this focus during the credential access tactic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - SideCopy has shown a particular interest in targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India, during the reconnaissance and resource development phases. In the collection phase, they utilize modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging. Since SideCopy has developed new RAT families and plugins specifically for espionage, it is likely that they would continue to target Kavach during the credential access tactic. Additionally, they have been observed using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices during the exfiltration phase. Given this context, it is plausible that SideCopy would use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
