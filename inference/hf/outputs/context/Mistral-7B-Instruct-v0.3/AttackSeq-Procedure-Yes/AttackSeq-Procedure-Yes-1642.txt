 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: PowerShell commands downloaded malicious payloads from compromised servers.
   - Execution: PowerShell commands downloaded a malicious payload, applied hotfixes for vulnerabilities, and used PowerSploit and Tater modules to execute the MSI package.
   - Persistence: The MSI package installed components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory and modified registry values to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).
   - Command and Control: The backdoor established a WebSocket connection with its servers for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the installation of a rootkit driver and a .vbs script to create a firewall rule blocking ports 135, 139, and 445 after ensuring persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the installation of a rootkit driver or a .vbs script to create a firewall rule. The persistence mechanism described is the installation of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory and modifying registry values.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence to support the installation of a rootkit driver or a .vbs script to create a firewall rule. Therefore, it is unlikely that PurpleFox will perform these actions as described in the question. Final Answer: B: No.
