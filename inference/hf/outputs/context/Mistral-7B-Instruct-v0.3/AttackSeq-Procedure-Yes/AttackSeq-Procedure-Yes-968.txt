 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Weaponized RTF file, archive files, direct delivery
   - Execution: Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - Persistence: Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - Defense Evasion: The group uses fileless loading techniques and frequently changes server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - Collection: Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to gather various types of information, including usernames, file metadata, and OS information.
   - Command and Control: The backdoor keeps listening for additional commands from the server, which are executed upon receipt.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor will attempt to gather information from the victim's machine, including usernames, as part of its system reconnaissance activities before performing tasks related to high-level collection like file searching or metadata gathering.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to gather various types of information, including usernames, file metadata, and OS information. This aligns with the question's focus on system reconnaissance activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Aria-body backdoor, as part of its system reconnaissance activities, has the capability to gather usernames and other information. Therefore, it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor will attempt to gather information from the victim's machine, including usernames, before performing tasks related to high-level collection like file searching or metadata gathering.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
