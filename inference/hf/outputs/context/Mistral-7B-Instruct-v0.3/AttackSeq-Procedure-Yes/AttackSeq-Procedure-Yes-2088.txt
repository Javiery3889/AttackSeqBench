 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Data collection for exfiltration.
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
   - Execution: Download and execute new payloads, run shell commands, delete files.
   - Persistence: Backdoor from Command and Control Server.
   - Privilege Escalation: Compromised Domain Administrator account.
   - Defense Evasion: Minimized detection opportunities.
   - Credential Access: Compromised Domain Administrator credentials.
   - Discovery: Used Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the network.
   - Lateral Movement: Moved laterally across the infrastructure.
   - Command and Control: Used Cobalt Strike beacon for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: Prepared documents for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After discovering and mapping the network, the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure and targeted internal hosts and servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after discovering and mapping the network (Discovery), the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure (Lateral Movement).

4. Final Answer:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, it is likely that the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure targeting internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
