 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactics involved:

1. Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (T1078) - The attacker uses a malicious app (XAgent) to gain access to the iOS devices.
2. Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) - The XAgent app runs in the background and restarts when terminated.
3. Discovery: Data Collection (T1086) - The XAgent app collects various types of data from the iOS devices.

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:

The question asks if it is likely that the malicious XAgent app will exfiltrate data via HTTP requests while communicating with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Comparing the question with the CTI outline, we can see that the XAgent app collects data (Discovery) but there is no explicit information about how the data is exfiltrated. However, since the malware is designed to communicate with a Command and Control (C&C) server (implied in the Execution phase), it is plausible that the data could be exfiltrated using network communication, such as HTTP requests. Additionally, the use of a Base64 encoded token for identification is a common technique for secure communication, so it is reasonable to assume that the malware might use this method for identification.

Final Answer: A: Yes
