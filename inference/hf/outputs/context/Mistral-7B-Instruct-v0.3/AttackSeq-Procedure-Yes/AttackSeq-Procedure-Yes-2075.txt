 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, which are slightly modified versions of publicly available exploits, usually obfuscated. This behavior falls under Obtain Capabilities and Compromise Infrastructure techniques. RIG EK also uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.
   - Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript. This process is non-disruptive and requires limited interaction, aligning with the Drive-by Compromise technique.
   - Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.
   - Command and Control: RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server. The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS. The exploit server detects the user's browser and returns the exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that RIG EK uses malvertising and compromised websites to deliver exploits (Initial Access) and that it uses PowerShell scripts to fetch malware (Command and Scripting Interpreter). The question's sequence of TTPs aligns with the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising or compromised websites (Initial Access) to redirect users to advertising pages or compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript. This process is non-disruptive and requires limited interaction, aligning with the Drive-by Compromise technique. Once the exploit is executed, it may use obfuscated PowerShell scripts to fetch malware (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Therefore, it is likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
