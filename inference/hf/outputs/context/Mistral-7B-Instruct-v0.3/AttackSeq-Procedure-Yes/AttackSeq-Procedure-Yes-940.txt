 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign distributing Zebrocy components.
   - Persistence: COM object hijacking for persistence, adding custom registry keys.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group will use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader before employing COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the initial access is achieved through spearphishing emails distributing Zebrocy components, which is a downloader. After initial access, the operators use a downloader written in Delphi that continues to run in the background. This downloader could be considered a Stage-1 downloader. The persistence is achieved through COM object hijacking, which involves adding custom registry keys.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the Sednit group will use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader (as mentioned in the question) before employing COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, where the Sednit group uses a downloader (Stage-1) to gain initial access and then uses another downloader (possibly downloaded by the initial Stage-1 downloader) before employing COM object hijacking for persistence.
