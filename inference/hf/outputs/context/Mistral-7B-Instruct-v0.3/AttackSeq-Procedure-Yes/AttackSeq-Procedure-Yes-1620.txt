 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline and match them with the TTPs mentioned in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that APT28 performs Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration. However, the Discovery phase is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

The question asks about APT28's actions after deploying a password dumper (run.exe) during the Credential Access phase. The question does not mention any actions related to Discovery, such as scanning the environment, reporting back to a central server, or centralizing discovered information.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline and the question, it is not plausible to conclude that APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to scan the environment, report back to a central server, and centralize discovered information during the Discovery phase after deploying a password dumper (run.exe).

Final Answer: No.
