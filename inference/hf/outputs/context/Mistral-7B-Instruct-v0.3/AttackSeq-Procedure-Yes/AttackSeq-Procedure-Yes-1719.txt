 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email with a ZIP file containing an executable (CozyDuke dropper)
   - Execution: CozyDuke dropper executes the main CozyDuke component using rundll32.exe
   - Defense Evasion: CozyDuke dropper checks for anti-virus, virtual machine, or sandbox environment and exits if detected
   - Command and Control: CozyDuke communicates with its C&C server using HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if CozyDuke will utilize COM-object hijacking before communicating with its C&C server

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention COM-object hijacking as part of CozyDuke's TTPs
   - The question's sequence of TTPs (COM-object hijacking, Communication with C&C server) does not align with the attack sequence in the CTI outline

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not indicate that CozyDuke uses COM-object hijacking as a technique for continued execution. Instead, it checks for anti-virus, virtual machine, or sandbox environment and exits if detected.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that CozyDuke will utilize COM-object hijacking to ensure continued execution before communicating with its C&C server via HTTP, HTTPS, or Twitter. (Final Answer: B: No)
