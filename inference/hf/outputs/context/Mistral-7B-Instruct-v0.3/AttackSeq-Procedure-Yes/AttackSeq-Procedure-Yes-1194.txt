 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used a malicious Word document to drop the BlackEnergy Trojan.
   - Execution: The Trojan was executed upon enabling macros in the Word document.
   - Persistence: The BlackEnergy dropper ensured persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
   - Impact: The BlackEnergy APT group's attacks were destructive, compromising industrial control installations, and espionage activities.
   - Others: The Trojan is detected by Kaspersky Lab's products, and its C&C server (5.149.254[.]114) is currently offline.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the BlackEnergy Trojan connecting to its C&C server or sending BASE64-encoded victim information. The C&C server mentioned in the outline is currently offline.

4. Final Answer: Based on the provided CTI outline, it is not likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information (Answer: B).
