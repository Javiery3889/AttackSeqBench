 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - Initial Access: Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
     - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
     - Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
     - Impact: Payloads downloaded and executed are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, does execute and subsequently downloads payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, is part of the attack sequence that leads to the download and execution of Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Therefore, it is likely that the PowerShell script will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Final Answer: A: Yes.
