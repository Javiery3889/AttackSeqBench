 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that CosmicDuke performs the following TTPs:
1. Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits
2. Execution: Uses a loader to execute the malware
3. Persistence: Creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service for persistence
4. Credential Access: Steals various types of credentials and Windows credentials
5. Discovery: Searches for files on hard drives and network drives
6. Command and Control: Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests, FTP, and WebDav
7. Exfiltration: Uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP

The question asks about the likelihood of CosmicDuke using a clipboard stealer before exfiltrating the collected information.

However, the CTI outline does not mention any TTP related to clipboard stealing. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Final Answer: No.
