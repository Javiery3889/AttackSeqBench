 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - Execution: User Execution (T1204)
   - Defense Evasion: File Deletion (T1107), Hidden Files and Directories (T1158), Software Packing (T1158)
   - Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), Credentials in Registry (T1214)
   - Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043), Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
   - Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor SWEED will collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that after the threat actor SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, they employed defense evasion techniques such as software packing (T1158) and deletion of the original file (T1107).
   - The Outline also shows that the threat actor then proceeded to collect credentials from the system (Credential Access) and exfiltrate data (Exfiltration).
   - Therefore, it is likely that the threat actor will collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. It is likely that after the threat actor SWEED exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, it will proceed to collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.
