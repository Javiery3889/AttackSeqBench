 To answer this question, we first need to understand the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by Stuxnet as described in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2010-2568 through malicious .LNK files.
2. Execution: Running malicious code on local and remote systems, using a DLL and kernel-mode drivers for code injection and file hiding.
3. Persistence: Installing kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components for maintaining control and executing upon system startup.
4. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities MS10-073 and MS10-092 to escalate privileges.
5. Defense Evasion: Hiding its presence, using rootkit functionality, stolen digital certificates, and patching system libraries.
6. Lateral Movement: Exploiting vulnerabilities and shared resources to propagate within the network.

The question asks about the possibility of Stuxnet communicating with its C&C servers after lateral movement. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about Stuxnet's communication methods with C&C servers.

Since the question is about encrypted communication, it is reasonable to assume that such a feature would be implemented to maintain secrecy and avoid detection. However, the CTI outline does not explicitly state that Stuxnet uses encrypted channels for communication with its C&C servers.

Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question based on the provided CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
