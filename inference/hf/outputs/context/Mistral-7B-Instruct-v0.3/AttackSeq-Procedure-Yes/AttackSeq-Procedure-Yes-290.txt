 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Dropping Elephant backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion. However, there is no direct mention of a file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

The answer choices are:
A: Yes
B: No

Given the information provided, it is not likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection (Answer B). The CTI outline does not indicate that this is a part of the Dropping Elephant's TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No.
