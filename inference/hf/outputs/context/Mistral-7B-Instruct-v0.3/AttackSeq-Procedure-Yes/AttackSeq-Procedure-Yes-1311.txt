 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing email with a malicious document (System.doc)
   - Execution: Malicious document (System.doc) is a backdoor (TONEDEAF) that communicates with a C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests
   - Persistence: Creation of a scheduled task to run System Manager.exe every minute
   - Defense Evasion: Exploit attempt by Microsoft Excel was detected and stopped by FireEye's ExploitGuard
   - Credential Access: Use of PICKPOCKET, VALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH malware for credential theft
   - Others: No specific information about TONEDEAF communicating with a C2 server

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if APT34 is likely to have TONEDEAF communicate with a C2 server identified as offlineearthquake[.]com to retrieve a sys_id for tracking infected targets.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about TONEDEAF communicating with a C2 server named offlineearthquake[.]com.
   - The question mentions TONEDEAF, but it does not mention the use of PICKPOCKET, VALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH malware for credential theft, which were specifically mentioned in the CTI outline as being used by APT34.
   - Since the question does not align with the sequence of TTPs and critical contextual information provided in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that APT34 would have TONEDEAF communicate with a C2 server identified as offlineearthquake[.]com to retrieve a sys_id for tracking infected targets.

Therefore, the answer is B: No.
