 To answer this question, we first need to understand the attack sequence from the CTI outline:

1. Initial Access: Social engineering (spear-phishing emails, fake blog website) and malware distribution (PowerPoint presentations disguised as self-extracting archives)
2. Persistence: Creation of a file named 'Java Update.lnk' and installation of the malware in 'appdata/ MicroDes/' and creation of a task named 'Microsoft_up'

The question asks about the "Collection" phase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the outline does mention that the malware uses Python embedded into Windows executables, and indicators of compromise include a known infection artifact 'hxxp://name.domain.org/nickname/set/Signed_Update.jar', which suggests that the malware may be capable of data collection.

However, the CTI outline does not provide any evidence that "Machete" specifically captures audio from the computer's microphone or copies files to a special USB device. The outline only mentions that the malware uses Python, which is unusual and suggests ease of coding rather than multi-platform support, and that malicious samples related to this attack are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua, which implies that the malware may be a spyware.

Given this information, it is not possible to definitively say whether "Machete" is likely to capture audio from the computer's microphone and copy files to a special USB device during the collection phase.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
