 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers gained initial access to the victims' devices by compromising the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website (knf.gov[.]pl) and downloading malicious JavaScript files from compromised domains.
   - Execution: The malware, gpsvc.exe, is downloaded and executed on the victims' devices.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses a commercial packer known as 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion and executes system information gathering commands.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicates with the C&C servers using a beacon with a User-Agent resembling a Firefox browser on Windows.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will attempt communication with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows as part of command and control activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware communicates with the C&C servers using a beacon with a User-Agent resembling a Firefox browser on Windows. This matches the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware, after executing system information discovery commands and returning the results to the C&C server, is likely to attempt communication with its C&C infrastructure using a beacon mimicking a Firefox browser on Windows as part of command and control activities.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
