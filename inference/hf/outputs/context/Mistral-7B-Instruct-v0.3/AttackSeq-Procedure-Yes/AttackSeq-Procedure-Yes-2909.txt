 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: Initial Access (Code Injection), Execution (Malicious Code Execution), Persistence (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Privilege Escalation (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Defense Evasion (Code Injection into trusted processes), Discovery (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Lateral Movement (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Collection (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Command and Control (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), Exfiltration (Not mentioned in the CTI outline), and Impact (Not mentioned in the CTI outline).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if threat actors will use the AtomBombing technique to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes. This sequence of TTPs can be associated with the Defense Evasion tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question's sequence of TTPs (Defense Evasion) is present in the attack sequence from the CTI outline (Defense Evasion occurs after Execution).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The AtomBombing technique allows threat actors to manipulate legitimate programs to execute malicious code (Execution). Since the technique can bypass antivirus, next-generation antivirus, and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions (as stated in the CTI outline), it is likely that threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes (Defense Evasion).

   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
