 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Tortoiseshell conducted reconnaissance by creating a fake website and distributing a malware downloader named 'bird.exe'.
   - Initial Access: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading the malware downloader from hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.
   - Persistence: The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware employed defense evasion techniques before the installation of 'IvizTech'.
   - Discovery: The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery after the initial access.
   - Command and Control: The RAT communicated with a C2 server after the persistence stage.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware downloader (bird.exe) is the initial access point, and the RAT (IvizTech) is installed and executed as a service for persistence. The malware downloader performs reconnaissance and defense evasion before the discovery and command and control stages. Therefore, it is not likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT is installed.

4. Final Answer: No. The malware downloader does not execute binaries before the RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service.
