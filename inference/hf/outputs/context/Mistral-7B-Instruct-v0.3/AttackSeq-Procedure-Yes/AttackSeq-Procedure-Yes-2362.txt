 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. The VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline shows that the VBScript downloaded a .doc file, which led to the execution of a PowerShell attack. While the outline does not explicitly state that the PowerShell command was base64 encoded, it does not contradict the possibility of base64 encoding. Additionally, the malware further executed using PowerShell, as stated in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is plausible that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

4. Conclusion: Final Answer: A: Yes. The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI outline, and there is no contradictory information to suggest otherwise.
