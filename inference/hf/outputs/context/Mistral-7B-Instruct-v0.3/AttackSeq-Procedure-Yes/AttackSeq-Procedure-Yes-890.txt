 To answer this question, let's first identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing campaigns to gain access with malicious URLs or exploit documents.
2. Execution: Malware execution on victim systems through spear-phishing emails that deliver exploit documents.
3. Credential Access: Harvesting credentials through spear-phishing or malicious applications.
4. Lateral Movement: Strategic web compromises (SWC) and exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers for movement within victim networks.

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:
The question asks if APT28 is likely to leverage legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, bypassing their traditional toolset for evading defenses.

Comparing the question with the attack sequence, we can see that the question is asking about the Lateral Movement phase. However, the question does not specify whether APT28 will use their traditional toolset or legitimate tools already present within victims' systems.

Let's evaluate each answer choice:
A: Yes - This answer choice suggests that APT28 may use legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, which aligns with the question.
B: No - This answer choice suggests that APT28 will not use legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, which contradicts the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes. It is likely that APT28 will leverage legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, bypassing their traditional toolset for evading defenses.
