 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 indeed gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance (Reconnaissance tactic).
   - The outline also mentions that FIN13 uses utilities like certutil, which is a legitimate utility, for detection evasion (Defense Evasion tactic). However, certutil is not explicitly mentioned as a tool for dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.
   - Although the outline does not explicitly state that FIN13 dumps LSASS process memory to obtain credentials after reconnaissance, it is reasonable to assume that they might use common privilege escalation techniques, which include dumping LSASS process memory and extracting credentials (Privilege Escalation tactic).

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
