 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload), Execution (XAgent component checks for debugger presence and waits for internet connectivity), Persistence (Komplex Dropper ensures persistence on the infected system, XAgent's Launcher module generates the malware's file path and re-executes itself), Credential Access (XAgent's Password module obtains passwords), Discovery (XAgent's InfoOS and RemoteShell modules gather information), Collection (XAgent's FileSystem module manages files), Command and Control (XAgent communicates with C&C servers), Exfiltration (XAgent sends encrypted data to C&C servers).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs related to the Komplex Binder and XAgent component in the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload on the system (Initial Access), and the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger to evade detection (Execution) later in the sequence. Therefore, it is likely that the Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload on the system before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger to evade detection.

4. The answer that aligns best with the attack sequence and any critical contextual information is "Yes".
