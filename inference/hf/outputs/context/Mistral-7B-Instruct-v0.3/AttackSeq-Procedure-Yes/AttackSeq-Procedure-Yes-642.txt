 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Moafee and DragonOK use custom-built backdoors and RATs, including CT/NewCT, Mongall, Nflog, PoisonIvy, and HTRAN.
   - Initial Access: Both groups use spear-phishing emails as the primary attack vector.
   - Execution: They employ environment-based evasion techniques, including CPU core checks.
   - Persistence: The CT/NewCT implant creates a registry entry for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: They use various techniques to evade detection, including environment-based evasion and CPU core checks.
   - Command and Control: They use encrypted data and plugin functionality for command and control communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access via spear-phishing emails.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after initial access, Moafee and DragonOK use custom-built backdoors and RATs (resource development) before employing environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails, Moafee and DragonOK would likely utilize custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development to support their operations. This is followed by the use of environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
