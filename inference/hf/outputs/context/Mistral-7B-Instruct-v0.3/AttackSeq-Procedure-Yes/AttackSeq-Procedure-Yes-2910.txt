 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of the AtomBombing technique for defense evasion, which allows threat actors to inject malicious code into trusted processes and bypass security products.
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: Defense Evasion -> Initial Access (implied, as the attacker already has access to the system) -> Execution -> Persistence (implied, as the malicious code is injected into trusted processes)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of threat actors bypassing antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions after using AtomBombing for code injection.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Defense Evasion -> Execution

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence from the CTI outline (Defense Evasion -> Execution) aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The answer choice A: Yes, suggests that threat actors will bypass antivirus, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions after using AtomBombing for code injection, which is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.
   - Answer choice B: No, contradicts the information provided in the CTI outline, as the AtomBombing technique is designed to bypass security products.

Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
