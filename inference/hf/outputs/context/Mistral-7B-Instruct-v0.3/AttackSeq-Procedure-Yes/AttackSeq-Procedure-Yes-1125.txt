 To answer this question, we first need to understand the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline:

1. Execution: DLL side-loading to execute malicious code
2. Defense Evasion: Using a clean loader, encrypting payloads, and concealing malware
3. Command and Control: Establishing a remote command shell to communicate with a command and control server

The question asks about the likelihood of the APT group configuring systems for exfiltration. However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder or collecting system information such as volume names and free disk space. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the question based on the provided CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
