 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The threat group impersonates the CEO and uses real domains (if no effective DMARC policy is in place) to make emails appear legitimate.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the threat group will employ defense evasion tactics by using real domains to make emails appear legitimate.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline confirms that the threat group does indeed use real domains to make emails appear legitimate, which aligns with the question's description of defense evasion tactics.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes".
