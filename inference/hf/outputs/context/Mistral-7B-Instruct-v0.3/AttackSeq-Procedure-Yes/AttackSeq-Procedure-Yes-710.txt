 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Malicious document executed a Crimson RAT downloader.
   - Persistence: The downloaded payload was made persistent on the system.
   - Defense Evasion: The payload had the capability to kill processes.
   - Credential Access: The Crimson RAT had functionalities for keylogging and browser credential theft.
   - Command and Control: The payload communicated with the C&C server and supported various commands.
   - Others: A similar attack using a malicious XLS document was identified in early August, which downloaded a payload from the same URL as found in the CTI outline.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious macro code within the XLS document will execute to first drop a Crimson RAT downloader before eventually downloading the fully functional Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malicious document executed a Crimson RAT downloader, which then downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT from the specified IP address. This sequence matches the sequence mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malicious XLS document executed a Crimson RAT downloader, which then downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT from the specified IP address. This sequence is consistent with the attack described in the CTI outline and the spear phishing campaign mentioned in the question. Therefore, it is likely that the malicious macro code within the XLS document will execute to first drop a Crimson RAT downloader before eventually downloading the fully functional Crimson RAT from the specified IP address. Final Answer: Yes.
