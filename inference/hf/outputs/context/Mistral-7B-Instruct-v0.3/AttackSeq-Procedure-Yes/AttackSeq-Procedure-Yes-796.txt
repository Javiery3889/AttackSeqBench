 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: JavaScript file creation and execution of 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.
   - Persistence: 'd3reEW.exe' creation, 'svchhast.exe' execution, copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and adding it to scheduled tasks.
   - Defense Evasion: Using a list of commands to bypass security detection.
   - Discovery: IP address information discovery using 'cmd /c ipconfig'.
   - Command and Control: HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Higaisa APT group will execute a JavaScript file to perform actions such as creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe', copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Higaisa APT group indeed executes a JavaScript file to perform the mentioned actions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Higaisa APT group has been observed executing a JavaScript file to create and execute 'd3reEW.exe', copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and send a POST request to a hardcoded URL. Therefore, it is likely that they will continue to do so in future attacks, including those that distribute malicious LNK files disguised as a Curriculum Vitae or IELTS exam results via spear-phishing.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
