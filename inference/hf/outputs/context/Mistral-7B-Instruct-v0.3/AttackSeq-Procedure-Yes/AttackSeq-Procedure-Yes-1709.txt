 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Turla malware infects government computers for Initial Access.
   - Persistence: Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks for persistent access.
   - Defense Evasion: Turla uses encryption to evade defenses and hides its tracks. It stores stolen data and tools in an encrypted file system.
   - Command and Control: Turla uses command and control servers to control infected systems, with regular updates to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Turla operators will use tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems before updating command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions the use of tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic in the CTI outline.
   - The question also mentions updating command and control servers worldwide, which aligns with the Command and Control tactic in the CTI outline.
   - The question does not mention the Initial Access or Persistence tactics, but these are not relevant to the sequence of TTPs in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Turla malware establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks for persistent access (Persistence tactic).
   - After establishing this foothold, it uses tools stored in an encrypted file system to collect data from local systems (Defense Evasion tactic).
   - Following data collection, the Turla operators update command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems (Command and Control tactic).
   - Therefore, it is likely that Turla operators will use tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems before updating command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems (Answer Choice A).
