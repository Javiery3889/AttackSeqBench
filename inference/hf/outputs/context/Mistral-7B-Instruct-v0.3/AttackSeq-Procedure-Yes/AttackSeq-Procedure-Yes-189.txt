 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery tactic includes the TTP of enumerating multiple directories and gathering system information. However, there is no mention of automatically collecting files based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

The Exfiltration tactic does mention that the netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals, but it does not specify that this is based on a predefined list of file extensions.

The question asks if it is likely that the component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase. Since there is no mention of such a TTP in the CTI outline, it is not likely that this will occur.

Final Answer: B: No.
