 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Charming Kitten impersonated researchers or journalists and sent emails with trackers.
   - Initial Access: Charming Kitten sent socially engineered emails and redirected victims to decoy websites.
   - Defense Evasion: Charming Kitten used email trackers and cookies to gather data.
   - Credential Access: Charming Kitten created phishing websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.
   - Command and Control: Charming Kitten used servers to host their fake websites.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Charming Kitten developed and used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram's official website, hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation, for resource development.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Charming Kitten indeed created phishing websites impersonating Google services (Credential Access) and did not specify the hosting provider. However, the question asks if the websites were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation. The CTI outline does not provide information about the hosting provider, so we cannot confirm if it was BelCloud Hosting Corporation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that Charming Kitten created phishing websites impersonating Google services, but it does not specify the hosting provider. The question asks if these websites were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation. Since the CTI outline does not provide this information, we cannot confirm if the answer is "Yes" or "No".

Final Answer: Indeterminate (Insufficient information to confirm either "Yes" or "No").
