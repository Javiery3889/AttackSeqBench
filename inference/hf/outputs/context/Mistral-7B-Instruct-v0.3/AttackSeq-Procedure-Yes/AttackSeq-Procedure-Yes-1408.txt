 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram were used to impersonate technical support or friends of the victims and deliver messages containing lures to trick victims into providing their Instagram credentials.
   - Credential Access: The attackers collected victims' Instagram credentials and associated email credentials using phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface. They then changed the account passwords and downloaded all images and messages from the accounts.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about ransom demands or further scams using the stolen accounts. However, the attackers have already gained unauthorized access to the accounts and have downloaded all images and messages. It is plausible that they could use these accounts to perpetuate further scams without demanding ransom payments.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers have already gained unauthorized access to the accounts and have downloaded all images and messages. They have also changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners.
   - It is plausible that the attackers could use these accounts to perpetuate further scams without demanding ransom payments. This is because they already have control over the accounts and the data they have downloaded can be used to create more convincing scams.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes, it is likely that the cybercriminals will use the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about ransom demands.
