 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spam emails with fake updates or exploiting current events.
   - Persistence: Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory.
   - Privilege Escalation: Hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking them at the firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks on important functions, registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files, and running such a file to execute with elevated privileges.
   - Credential Access: Steals credentials stored in Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
   - Discovery: Collects information about its victims, including computer name, username, operating system version and bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed. It also lists installed security products.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, after employing numerous tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly shows that Grandoreiro collects information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, as part of the Discovery tactic. The tactics of API hooking and detection of virtual environments are part of the Privilege Escalation tactic, which occurs before the Discovery tactic in the attack sequence. Therefore, it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect this information after employing these tactics.

4. Final Answer: Yes
