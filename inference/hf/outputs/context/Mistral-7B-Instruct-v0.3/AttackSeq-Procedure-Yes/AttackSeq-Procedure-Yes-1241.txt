 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (Execution), Defense Evasion, Discovery, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Persistence.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the initial access using malicious Microsoft Office documents hosted on Google Drive. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is Execution (downloading a base64-encoded binary) and Persistence (creating a 'ChromeUpdater' entry in the Windows registry).

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline shows that the malicious Office document's Macro executes first, downloading a base64-encoded binary from Google Drive. After that, the final payload (JhoneRAT) creates persistence by adding an entry to the 'Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' registry key. Therefore, it is likely that the campaign will execute a Macro to download a base64-encoded binary before achieving persistence.

4. The answer that aligns best with the attack sequence and any critical contextual information is "Yes".
