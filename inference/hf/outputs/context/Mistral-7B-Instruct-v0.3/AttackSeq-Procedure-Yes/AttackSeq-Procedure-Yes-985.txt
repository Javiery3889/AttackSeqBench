 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Obtaining passwords from Firefox browser profiles using the Password module of XAgent.
2. Using the RemoteShell module to list installed applications on the infected system.
3. Using the FileSystem module for file management operations such as creating and executing files.

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: Komplex Binder, Dropper, Payload
2. Execution: Initialization of XAgent's BootXLoader and MainHandler
3. Persistence: Komplex Dropper and XAgent's Launcher ensure persistence
4. Defense Evasion: Komplex Binder opens a decoy PDF file and XAgent checks for debugger presence
5. Credential Access: Password module within XAgent obtains passwords from Firefox browser profiles
6. Collection: FileSystem module within XAgent is used for file management
7. Command and Control: Communication between XAgent and C&C servers
8. Exfiltration: Data is sent to C&C servers using msgPacket structure and HTTPChannel module

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Password module is used for credential access (step 5), and the FileSystem module is used for collection (step 6). However, the RemoteShell module is not mentioned in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is not likely that the RemoteShell module will list installed applications on the infected system before the FileSystem module is used for file management operations.

Final Answer: No.
