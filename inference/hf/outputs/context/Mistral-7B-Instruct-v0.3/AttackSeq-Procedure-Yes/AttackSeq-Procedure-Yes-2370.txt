 To answer this question, let's first identify the TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) mentioned in the question:
1. Discovery: Collection of detailed system information and file listings
2. Exfiltration: Exfiltration of collected data

Now, let's compare these TTPs with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: Infection of removable media and collection of data from drives
2. Execution: Operation of the malware netsat.exe as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives
3. Defense Evasion: Cleanup of key indicators of its presence and self-deletion after a hardcoded date
4. Discovery: Collection of detailed information from systems they infect
5. Command and Control: Command and control via encrypted file on the local system
6. Exfiltration: Data collection functionality of netsat.exe suggests the need for exfiltration, but the means are not determined

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery phase involves the collection of detailed system information and file listings, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question. However, the question asks about the Collection phase, and the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware archives collected data using a custom XOR operation for obfuscation before exfiltration.

The CTI outline only suggests that the data collection functionality of netsat.exe might be used for exfiltration, but it does not provide enough information to confirm whether the data is obfuscated or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question based on the provided CTI outline.

Final Answer: It is not possible to determine with the given information whether the malware will archive collected data using a custom XOR operation for obfuscation before exfiltrating it.
