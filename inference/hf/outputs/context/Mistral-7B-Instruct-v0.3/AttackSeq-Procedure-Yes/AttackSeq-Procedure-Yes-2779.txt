 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the Question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access (Phishing)
     - Credential Access (Harvesting credentials through a forged Microsoft login page)
     - Note that there is no indication of any other tactics being used in this specific sequence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the impersonation of a prominent Israeli physicist (Initial Access via Phishing), and a link leading to a TA453-controlled domain (Initial Access via Web-based attack). However, it does not mention the forged Microsoft login page (Credential Access) that was used in the CTI outline.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions two Initial Access tactics (Phishing and Web-based attack), but the CTI outline only mentions one Initial Access tactic (Phishing) followed by Credential Access. The question does not mention the Credential Access tactic, which is a critical part of the attack sequence in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question mentions the impersonation of a prominent Israeli physicist, which is an Initial Access tactic (Phishing). However, it does not mention the forged Microsoft login page (Credential Access) that was used in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is not likely that the phishing emails included a link leading to the TA453-controlled domain before the domain presented a forged Microsoft login page to harvest user credentials.

Final Answer: No.
