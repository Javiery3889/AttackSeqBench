 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers information about victim networks and targets financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - Initial Access: FIN13 deploys web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - Execution: FIN13 uses JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
   - Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 utilizes common privilege escalation techniques, such as dumping LSASS process memory and using Mimikatz to extract credentials.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics like using passive backdoors for stealth and chaining web shells for complex pivots.
   - Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.
   - Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses lateral movement techniques like WMI and custom web shells (such as BUSTEDPIPE) to move within the network. This movement allows them to gather information about network and host configurations.
   - After gathering this information, the CTI outline also indicates that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it for fraudulent transactions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN13 uses lateral movement techniques to gather information about network and host configurations (Lateral Movement).
   - After gathering this information, FIN13 collects data from network shared drives (Collection).
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions (Answer: Yes).
