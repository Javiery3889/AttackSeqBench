 To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Aumlib and Ixeshe malware are deployed. Aumlib encodes certain HTTP communications, and Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns.
   - Command and Control: Aumlib malware is downloaded from URLs like status[.]acmetoy[.]com, and Ixeshe contains encoded data with victim information and a campaign tag.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it's likely that APT12 will attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware and employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic before connecting to specific URLs during command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that Aumlib encodes certain HTTP communications during the execution phase, which aligns with encoding the HTTP POST body. However, it does not specify a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic.
   - The question does not mention the URLs for Ixeshe, but the CTI outline mentions that Ixeshe connects to URLs like status[.]acmetoy[.]com, which is similar to the URLs mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline suggests that APT12 has updated their malware to encode certain HTTP communications (Aumlib) and contains encoded data (Ixeshe). This aligns with the question's requirement of encoding the HTTP POST body for Aumlib.
   - The question also asks about a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic, but the CTI outline does not provide specific information about a change in Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe.
   - However, since the attackers are known to evolve their TTPs, it is plausible that they could employ a different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic as part of their defense evasion strategy.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes (It is likely that APT12 will attempt to encode the HTTP POST body of Aumlib malware, but the answer is uncertain for the different Base64 encoding pattern for Ixeshe malware traffic due to lack of specific information in the CTI outline).
