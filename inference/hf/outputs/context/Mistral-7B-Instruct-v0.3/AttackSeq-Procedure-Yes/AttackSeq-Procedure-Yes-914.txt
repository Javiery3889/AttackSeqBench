 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The Tuyul malware has the functionality to execute Perl scripts (perl) and shell commands (shell).
   - It also downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions gaining initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems through CVE-2017-9841.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Tuyul malware has the capability to execute Perl scripts and shell commands.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute these commands, which aligns with the capabilities mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The question also mentions downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence, which is a known tactic from the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Tuyul malware, after gaining initial access through CVE-2017-9841, has the capability to execute Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.
   - It is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute these commands before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
