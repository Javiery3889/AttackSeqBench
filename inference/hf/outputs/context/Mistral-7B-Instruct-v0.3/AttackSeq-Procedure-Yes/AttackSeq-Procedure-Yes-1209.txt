 To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the CTI outline and the question. The CTI outline mentions that the Discovery tactic involves PyFlash executing various OS-related commands and sending the information to the C&C server, but it does not specify the ports used for communication. However, the question asks about NetFlash and PyFlash, and it is not clear from the CTI outline that they use the same ports for communication.

The CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided information.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined with the provided information.
