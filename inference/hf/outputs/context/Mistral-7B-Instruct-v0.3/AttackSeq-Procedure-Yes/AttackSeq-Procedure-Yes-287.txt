 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and identify the attack sequence:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (Spear-phishing, Watering hole attacks)
3. Initial Access (Exploitation of CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352)
4. Execution (Download of backdoor)
5. Defense Evasion (Downloading and decoding encoded blobs)
6. Credential Access (Stealing Google Chrome credentials)
7. Collection (File-stealer module collects and uploads specific file types)

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:
The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.

Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Comparing the question with the attack sequence, we can see that the Collection tactic involves the backdoor uploading targeted file types to the C2 server, but there is no mention of the backdoor pinging the C2 server at regular intervals before this action.

Final Answer: B: No. The backdoor is not likely to ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types.
