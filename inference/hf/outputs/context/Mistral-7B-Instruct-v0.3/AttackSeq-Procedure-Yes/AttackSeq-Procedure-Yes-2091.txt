 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the attackers discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, after discovering and mapping the network (Discovery) and collecting administrative-level credentials (Credential Access), the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers (Execution). Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs aligns with answer choice A: Yes.
