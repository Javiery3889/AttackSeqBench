 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline: The StellarParticle campaign used various initial access techniques, including SSH, RDP, VPNs, and credential theft. They demonstrated persistence by using credential hopping, Delegated Administrator rights, TrailBlazer malware, GoldMax malware, and O365 Service Principals. Defense evasion techniques included stealing browser cookies, renaming utilities, and system renaming. Credential access techniques involved stealing web session cookies, using privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP, compromised service principals, and accessing data from Information Repositories. Discovery activities included using AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify Active Directory information. Lateral Movement was achieved using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI Outline shows that the StellarParticle campaign used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP as a method of lateral movement. The Discovery activities mentioned in the question (using AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets) are separate from the lateral movement and data access activities. However, the question does not specify a time frame, and it is reasonable to assume that the threat actor would use the same methods (RDP) for lateral movement and data access, given the context of the CTI Outline.

Therefore, it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.
