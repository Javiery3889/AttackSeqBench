 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Rocket Kitten uses malware to execute attacks, including a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) and other malware as needed.
   - Persistence: Rocket Kitten repeatedly attempts to attack the same targets and takes over accounts immediately after obtaining passwords.
   - Defense Evasion: Rocket Kitten uses defense evasion techniques, but there's no mention of them establishing initial access on target machines.
   - Credential Access: Rocket Kitten steals credentials through social engineering and spear phishing.
   - Command and Control: Infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download malware and extract information from victims.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Rocket Kitten will employ spear phishing and social engineering to establish initial access on target machines.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering to steal credentials (Credential Access). However, it doesn't explicitly state that they use these techniques to establish initial access on target machines.
   - The question asks about establishing initial access, which is a different stage from stealing credentials.
   - Given the persistence and the use of spear phishing and social engineering for credential theft, it's plausible that Rocket Kitten would use these techniques to establish initial access on target machines.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering to steal credentials (Credential Access).
   - Establishing initial access on target machines is a logical next step for Rocket Kitten, given their persistence and the fact that they take over accounts immediately after obtaining passwords.
   - Therefore, it's likely that Rocket Kitten will employ spear phishing and social engineering to establish initial access on target machines.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
