 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to download an HTA file from webserv-redir.net.
   - Execution: The HTA file executed a script that checked for installed antivirus software using WMI and proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe.
   - Defense Evasion: The HTA file avoided PowerShell and used VBS, and the backdoor employed DLL sideloading.
   - Discovery: The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.
   - Persistence: The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
   - Others: The HTA file communicated with the C2 server, and webserv-redir.net was associated with the campaign.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the HTA file communicated with the C2 server, and webserv-redir.net was associated with the campaign.
   - Answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with the attack sequence and the contextual information provided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The HTA file downloaded from webserv-redir.net checks for installed antivirus software, executes a backdoor, and communicates with the C2 server. Therefore, it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
