 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Longhorn uses zero-day vulnerabilities and back door Trojans to compromise targets, including a Word document with a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - Discovery: Longhorn's malware has detailed system fingerprinting capabilities for discovery.
   - Collection: Longhorn's malware is customizable with additional plugins and modules for remote control.
   - Command and Control: Longhorn uses operational security measures, including privacy services and custom cryptographic protocols, to protect communications from identification.
   - Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Longhorn uses operational security measures, including privacy services, custom cryptographic protocols, upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection. These tactics align with the guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents.
   - Longhorn's malware also has detailed system fingerprinting capabilities for discovery, which is one of the tactics mentioned in the Vault 7 documents.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability and infecting a target with Plexor malware.
   - After gaining initial access, Longhorn uses operational security measures to avoid detection, including privacy services, custom cryptographic protocols, upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals.
   - Longhorn then performs detailed system fingerprinting for discovery, which is one of the tactics mentioned in the Vault 7 documents.
   - Therefore, it is likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
