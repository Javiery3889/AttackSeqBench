 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising or compromised sites.
   - Execution: RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
   - Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
   - Command and Control: RIG EK uses malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that RIG EK uses malvertising or compromised sites to deliver exploits to victims. This aligns with the question's description of redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - RIG EK uses malvertising or compromised sites to deliver exploits to victims, which is the initial access point. After successful execution, it runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure. This sequence of events aligns with the question's description, making answer choice A the most plausible.
