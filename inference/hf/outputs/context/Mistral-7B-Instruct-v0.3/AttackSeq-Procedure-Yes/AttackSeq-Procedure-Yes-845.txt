 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Compromising the 'patient zero'
   - Execution: Execution of malicious code
   - Persistence: Ensuring ongoing access to the compromised network
   - Defense Evasion: Bypassing defense and detection mechanisms
   - Credential Access: Gaining access to systems with legitimate credentials
   - Discovery: Exploring the target network
   - Lateral Movement: Moving across the network to relevant data
   - Collection: Collecting the relevant data
   - Command and Control: Establishing communication with the compromised target infrastructure
   - Exfiltration: Exfiltrating the relevant data

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After executing malicious code, the question asks if it is likely that attackers will ensure persistence within the target network before using increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after executing malicious code (Execution), the next phase is Persistence, which ensures ongoing access to the compromised network. This is followed by Lateral Movement, which involves moving across the network to relevant data. These two phases directly address the question's requirement of ensuring persistence within the target network and spreading to other systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After executing malicious code on a local or remote system, it is likely that attackers will ensure persistence within the target network (Persistence phase) before using increased privileges to spread to other systems or gain access to strategic goals (Lateral Movement phase).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
