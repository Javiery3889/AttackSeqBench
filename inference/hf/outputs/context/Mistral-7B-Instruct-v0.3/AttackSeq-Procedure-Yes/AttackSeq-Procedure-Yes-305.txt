 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used a phishing campaign to gain access to the targeted systems.
   - Initial Access Technique: Phishing (T1192)
   - Initial Access Vector: Email (T1199)
   - Initial Access Delivery: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
   - Initial Access Exploit: CVE-2017-0262 (Exploitation of Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Russian-language phishing campaign exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter through malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
   - The question does not mention the establishment of communication with a compromised server for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers exploited CVE-2017-0262 in Microsoft's EPS filter through malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
   - The question's description matches the attack sequence in the CTI outline, as the initial access was achieved through the exploitation of the EPS filter in docx files containing obfuscated code.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Russian-language phishing campaign used malicious docx files containing obfuscated code to exploit CVE-2017-0262 in Microsoft's EPS filter, which allowed the attackers to gain initial access to the targeted systems.
   - The question asks if this was the case, and the answer is indeed yes, as the CTI outline provides evidence of this sequence of TTPs.
   - The question does not mention the establishment of communication with a compromised server for command and control, so it is not relevant to the answer.
