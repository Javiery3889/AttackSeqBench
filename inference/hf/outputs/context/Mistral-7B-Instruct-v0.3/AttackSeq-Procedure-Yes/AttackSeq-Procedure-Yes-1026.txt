 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Use of scripting, CreateProcess, rundll32, and user execution of malicious email attachments
   - Persistence: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modifying registry keys, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates, and csc.exe compilation
   - Discovery: Automatic listing of interesting files, such as Office documents
   - Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macro to send emails
   - Command and Control: Uses both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control
   - Exfiltration: Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server
   - Others: No specific mention of scanning all drives for sensitive data

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration. This implies that the malware is designed to search for and collect specific types of files, including those on network shares.
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware scans all drives for sensitive data, the context provided about the group's strategy of installing multiple scripts and executables on each system and constantly updating them suggests that they may have the capability to scan all drives if needed.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is plausible that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
