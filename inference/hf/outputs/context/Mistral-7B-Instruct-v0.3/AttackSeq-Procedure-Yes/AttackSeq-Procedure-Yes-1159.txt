 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Trojanized installation files are used to gain access.
   - Execution: Malware deploys, creates service for persistence, and executes PowerShell command to reconfigure Windows Defender.
   - Persistence: Malware creates a service for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Malware checks for antivirus and adds exclusions to Windows Defender.
   - Collection: Malware searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files.
   - Command and Control: Malware communicates over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the malware encoding the archives with an unusual scheme and splitting them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware compresses Microsoft Office files into archives during the Collection phase. However, the outline does not explicitly state that the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme or splits them into chunks.
   - However, the outline does mention that the malware encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server. This encoding could be considered an unusual scheme, and the question does not specify that the scheme must be completely unique.
   - The question does not mention any specific method for splitting the archives into chunks, but the outline does not contradict the possibility of this happening.

4. Conclusion:
   - The malware compresses Microsoft Office files into archives during the Collection phase and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server. While the outline does not explicitly state that the malware splits the archives into chunks, it does not contradict the possibility. Therefore, it is plausible that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase.
