 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 performs internal reconnaissance and gathers information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.
   - Initial Access: FIN13 establishes a foothold in victim networks through web shells on external servers.
   - Execution: FIN13 uses JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE for local command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including trojanized KeePass binaries and malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses utilities like ProcDump, Mimikatz, certutil, and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities.
   - Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - Discovery: FIN13 performs internal reconnaissance to support their objectives.
   - Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement and cross-platform operations.
   - Command and Control: FIN13 uses various protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to collect data from network shared drives and then stage the data either locally or remotely for eventual fraudulent transactions.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 performs internal reconnaissance (Discovery) to gather information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services. This includes data from network shared drives.
   - FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services (Exfiltration), which could be used for fraudulent transactions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN13 performs internal reconnaissance to gather information, including data from network shared drives (Discovery).
   - FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, which could be used for fraudulent transactions (Exfiltration).
   - Therefore, it is likely that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages the data for eventual fraudulent transactions (Answer: Yes).
