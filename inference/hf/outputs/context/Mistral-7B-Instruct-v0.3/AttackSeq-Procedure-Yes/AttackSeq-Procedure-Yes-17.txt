 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Persistence: "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs the malware in 'appdata/MicroDes/'.
   - Collection: "Machete" is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing audio from the computer's microphone, taking screenshots, capturing geolocation data, taking photos from the computer's web camera, copying files to a remote server, copying files to a special USB device if inserted, and hijacking the clipboard to capture information from the target machine.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that "Machete" will subsequently log keystrokes, capture audio from the computer's microphone, and hijack the clipboard to collect information from the target machine after establishing persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that "Machete" is capable of performing the mentioned actions (logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard) under the Collection tactic. Since the question asks if it is likely that these actions will occur after establishing persistence, the answer is yes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline provides evidence that "Machete" is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard. After establishing persistence, it is likely that these actions will occur as they are part of the malware's functionality.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
