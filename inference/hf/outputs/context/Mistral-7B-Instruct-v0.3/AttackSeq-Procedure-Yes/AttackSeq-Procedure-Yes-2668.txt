 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: OceanLotus backdoor distributed via email attachment, disguised as a Microsoft Word document.
   - Execution: Trojan executes and opens a password-protected Word document.
   - Persistence: Backdoor creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a location based on the user's UID.
   - Defense Evasion: Backdoor avoids command line utilities and suspicious strings, employs obfuscation, and uses a custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - Command and Control: Backdoor communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, sending and receiving encrypted data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the backdoor communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, sending and receiving encrypted data (Command and Control tactic). This suggests that the backdoor does send encrypted data to its command and control server, which includes system information for further analysis.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The OceanLotus backdoor, after achieving persistence, creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a location based on the user's UID. This action does not directly involve surveying the victim's computer or sending system information. However, the backdoor is known to communicate with its command and control server using a custom binary protocol with encryption (Command and Control tactic). This communication sequence involves receiving commands and sending back the results encrypted with AES in CBC mode, which could include system information. Therefore, it is likely that the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server (Answer Choice A).
