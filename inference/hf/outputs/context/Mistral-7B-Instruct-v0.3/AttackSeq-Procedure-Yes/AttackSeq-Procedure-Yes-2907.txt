 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT15 gained access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - Execution: APT15 deployed backdoors, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS, for execution evasion and command execution.
   - Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if APT15 is likely to use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT15 used Mimikatz for privilege escalation, which involves gaining domain administrator credentials. OS credential dumping is a process that retrieves stored credentials from a system's memory, and it is a common technique used after gaining initial access to a system. In this case, it is plausible that APT15 would use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping before deploying tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining initial access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials, APT15 would likely use Mimikatz for OS credential dumping to gather additional credentials for further actions within the network. This would allow them to deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
