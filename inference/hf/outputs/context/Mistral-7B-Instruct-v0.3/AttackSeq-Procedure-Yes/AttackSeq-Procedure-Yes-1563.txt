 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: SolarWinds was compromised through a supply-chain attack, deploying the Sunburst backdoor on the networks of over 18,000 customers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Sunburst backdoor was deployed for initial access, which implies that it would need to communicate with its C2 server to carry out further exploitation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Sunburst backdoor was deployed for initial access, and it is necessary for it to communicate with its C2 server to carry out further exploitation. Therefore, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server for further exploitation (Answer A).
