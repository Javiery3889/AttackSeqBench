 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline and the question:

1. Initial Access: Malicious document opening (likely via phishing email)
2. Execution: Malicious VBS scripts execution, HTA files execution, creation of scheduled tasks, command execution via scripts, execution of additional Pterodo variants, VNC client installation
3. Persistence: Creation of scheduled tasks for malicious VBS files execution
4. Collection: Deployment of custom VBS backdoor variants, execution of VBS scripts
5. Command and Control: Communication with C&C servers using HTTP requests, tool downloading

Now, let's compare the attack sequence described in the question with the sequence from the CTI outline:

1. After executing malicious VBS scripts to maintain their presence and deploying their custom backdoor, Shuckworm is likely to use mshta.exe for what purpose?

The question mentions the use of mshta.exe, but there is no evidence in the CTI outline that Shuckworm used mshta.exe for bypassing application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading. The CTI outline mentions the use of VBS scripts, HTA files, and scheduled tasks for maintaining their presence and deploying their backdoor, but it does not mention mshta.exe.

Final Answer: No. Shuckworm is not likely to use mshta.exe for the mentioned purpose based on the provided CTI outline.
