 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: .NET/MSIL dropper (Runer.exe) delivers the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor.
   - Execution: Runer.exe deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper (Scr.js), which installs a JS decryptor and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
   - Persistence: Scr.js creates a scheduled task for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: The dropper and backdoor lack obfuscation or anti-analysis features, and the backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites.
   - Discovery: Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and checks for Kaspersky Lab directories.
   - Command and Control: The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests and can receive commands, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the KopiLuwak backdoor is likely to exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites and can receive commands, including exfiltrating data and downloading files. Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C2 server and download files to the infected machine.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests (Command and Control tactic). This communication allows the backdoor to receive commands, including exfiltrating data and downloading files (as stated in the CTI outline). Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine (Answer Choice A).
