 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Higaisa APT group distributed malicious LNK files.
   - Execution: Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack, including executing a JavaScript file.
   - Defense Evasion: The attack employs commands to bypass security detection.
   - Discovery: The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information.
   - Command and Control: The attack makes HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the JavaScript file copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory or adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
   - The only action related to persistence is the copying of 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, but it is not mentioned that 'officeupdate.exe' is added to scheduled tasks.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence that the JavaScript file copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory and adds 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks. Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript file will perform these actions.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
