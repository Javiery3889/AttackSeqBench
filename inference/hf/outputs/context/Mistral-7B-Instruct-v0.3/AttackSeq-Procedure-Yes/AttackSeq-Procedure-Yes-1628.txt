 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses various methods for initial access, including spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.
   - Discovery: APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to probe potential victims' identity information before employing spear phishing emails for initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT28 first discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems (Discovery). This action can be considered probing potential victims' identity information.
   - After discovering the environment, APT28 employs spear phishing emails for initial access (Initial Access).

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, it is plausible that APT28 probes potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots before employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails for gaining initial access. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
