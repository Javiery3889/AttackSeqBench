 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses a malicious Word document with the DDE technique to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The document invokes PowerShell, downloads a string and a Base64 encoded command, and creates a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.
   - Persistence: The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence of the malware on the victim's system.
   - Defense Evasion: APT28 uses new techniques to bypass network defenses.
   - Others: The document downloads the Seduploader first-stage reconnaissance implant, which contacts a control server to profile victims and potentially install X-Agent or Sedreco.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malicious document downloads the Seduploader first-stage implant, which is known to contact a control server.
   - The question asks if the malicious document will contact a control server, and the answer is yes, based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malicious document uses the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands, which download the Seduploader first-stage implant.
   - The Seduploader implant is known to contact a control server to profile victims and potentially install X-Agent or Sedreco.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malicious document will contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
