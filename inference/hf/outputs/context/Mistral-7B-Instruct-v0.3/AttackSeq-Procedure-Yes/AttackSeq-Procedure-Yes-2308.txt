 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Credential stuffing/password spraying attack against remote services, followed by accessing the victim's VPN, Citrix, or other remote services.
   - Execution: Installation of Cobalt Strike and its beacon in memory.
   - Persistence: No persistence mechanisms on the compromised system, but the adversary installs the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
   - Privilege Escalation: Password spraying attack against domain admin accounts or lateral movement to another system with a domain admin logged in.
   - Defense Evasion: Clean-up of traces from intrusions, including Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, timestomping, and indicator removal.
   - Discovery: Wide range of discovery tactics, including the use of PsLogList to export Security Event logs and identify privileged users.
   - Lateral Movement: Use of Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities, such as SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
   - Command and Control: Use of Cobalt Strike as a framework to manage compromised systems, with C2 protocol encapsulated in DNS or HTTPS.
   - Exfiltration: Exfiltration of small amounts of data through the command and control channel, and large amounts of data using a custom built tool to cloud storage web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the Discovery phase, the adversary uses PsLogList to export the contents of the Security Event log, which may contain information about email activities. Additionally, the adversary moves laterally to other systems and uses Cobalt Strike's built-in Mimikatz to dump credentials or password hashes, which could potentially include email account credentials. Furthermore, the exfiltration of data includes large amounts of data from network shares, which could include email messages. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The adversary uses PsLogList to export the Security Event log, which may contain information about email activities. They also move laterally to other systems and use Mimikatz to dump credentials or password hashes, which could potentially include email account credentials. Additionally, the exfiltration of data includes large amounts of data from network shares, which could include email messages. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems as part of their collection activities. Final Answer: Yes.
