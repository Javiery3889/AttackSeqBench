 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Stolen credentials, SSH tools, remote tunneling, SSH private keys, payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS)
   - Execution: Malicious code execution, scripts, encrypted files, PowerShell loader, 64-bit/32-bit backdoor, custom VM-based payload loader
   - Defense Evasion: Process injection, deobfuscation
   - Discovery: Process discovery, system information discovery, system time discovery, network service scanning
   - Collection: Custom storage file format
   - Command and Control: Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, SSL-encrypted traffic, RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication, proxy tools

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication. This aligns with the question's requirement of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
   - The question does not specify any other conditions or requirements for data exfiltration, and the CTI outline does not provide information about data exfiltration methods other than the secure C2 communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication, which aligns with the question's requirement.
   - The question does not specify any other conditions or requirements for data exfiltration, and the CTI outline does not provide information about data exfiltration methods other than the secure C2 communication. Therefore, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
