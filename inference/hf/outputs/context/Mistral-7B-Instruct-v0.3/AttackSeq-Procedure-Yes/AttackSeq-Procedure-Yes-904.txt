 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics used by Dexphot and whether SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader is a common technique for defense evasion.

From the CTI outline, we know that Dexphot uses process hollowing to load its malicious executables into legitimate system processes, which is a technique for process injection, not defense evasion. Defense evasion tactics often involve obfuscation, camouflage, or hiding malicious activity.

SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader is an obfuscation technique used to bundle multiple executables into a single file. However, the CTI outline does not mention the use of this technique by Dexphot.

Given the information provided, it is not likely that Dexphot uses the SoftwareBundler:Win32/ICLoader as part of its defense evasion tactics.

Final Answer: No.
