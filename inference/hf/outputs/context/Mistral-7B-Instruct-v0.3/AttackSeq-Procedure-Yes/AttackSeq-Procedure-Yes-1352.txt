 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The spear-phishing attack exploits the Adobe Flash vulnerability through the links rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf and report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf for initial access.
   - Defense Evasion: The malicious Flash file 'show.swf' attempts to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode to install a payload, with the payload embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that the malicious Flash file 'show.swf' attempts to execute shellcode (Initial Access) and then embeds the payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif' (Defense Evasion).
   - The question's sequence of TTPs matches the sequence in the CTI Outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malicious Flash file 'show.swf' is used for initial access and executes shellcode. Afterward, it attempts to evade defenses by embedding the payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'. Therefore, it is likely that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will execute shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes before attempting to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
