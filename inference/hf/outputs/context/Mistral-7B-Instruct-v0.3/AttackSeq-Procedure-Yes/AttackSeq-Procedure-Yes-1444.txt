 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can identify the following sequence of TTPs:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (via email attachment exploiting CVE-2012-0158)
3. Execution (beaconing to a command-and-control server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern)
4. Defense Evasion (using a downloader that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts)

The question asks about the communication of the new Taidoor variant with command-and-control servers. However, the CTI outline does not provide specific information about the command-and-control servers used by the new Taidoor variant. It only mentions that the malware beacons to a command-and-control server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.

The answer choices do not provide any details about the command-and-control servers used by the new Taidoor variant, so it's impossible to definitively say whether the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the servers mentioned in the answer choices (roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw). Therefore, none of the answer choices can be confirmed as correct based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
