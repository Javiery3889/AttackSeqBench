 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT3 and APT18 launched phishing campaigns exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119).
   - APT3's TTPs: Phishing emails containing URLs that resolved to IP address 194.44.130.179, downloading an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload (DLL backdoor).
   - APT18's TTPs: Phishing emails prompting victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update, delivering a GH0ST RAT variant.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the communication of the SHOTPUT backdoor (APT3) and GH0ST RAT (APT18) with their respective CnC addresses.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - APT3's SHOTPUT backdoor communicates over HTTP to hardcoded command and control (CnC) addresses, as mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - APT18's GH0ST RAT variant calls out to a known APT18 CnC address (223.25.233.248), as stated in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - APT3's SHOTPUT backdoor and APT18's GH0ST RAT have different CnC addresses, but they both communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses as part of their TTPs.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT calls out to an APT18 CnC address.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
