 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question. The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel will deploy tcpdump to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic before exfiltrating files at regular intervals.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Infamous Chisel performs Discovery (enumerating multiple data directories, collecting GPS information, listing installed packages, and gathering system information), Collection (automatically collecting files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and collecting files from application and data directories containing communication data), and Exfiltration (automatically exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections).

However, there is no mention of Infamous Chisel using tcpdump to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that Infamous Chisel will deploy tcpdump for network traffic monitoring before exfiltrating files.

Final Answer: No.
