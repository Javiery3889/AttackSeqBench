 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by the Lazarus Group as described in the CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance: The Lazarus Group used system utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe for reconnaissance, as well as unknown PE files. However, there's no direct mention of adfind in the reconnaissance phase.

2. Initial Access: The Lazarus Group used malicious documents containing job offers to gain initial access.

3. Execution: They executed malicious code using system utilities, a backdoor named CommsCacher, and the Windows command line.

4. Persistence: The group created services and placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.

5. Privilege Escalation: They escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.

6. Defense Evasion: The group used various techniques to evade detection, but there's no direct mention of adfind in the defense evasion phase.

7. Lateral Movement: The group moved laterally on the network using their own data encryption algorithm and compromised legitimate privileged accounts.

8. Command and Control: They used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to the C2 servers.

In the question, we are asked if it's likely that the Lazarus Group will collect information about network users and settings using tools like adfind before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.

The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the Lazarus Group used adfind for reconnaissance or information gathering. However, it's reasonable to assume that after gaining initial access and executing malicious code, they might collect information about network users and settings to aid in their lateral movement. The question asks about using adfind, but the CTI outline does not mention adfind specifically in the context of reconnaissance or information gathering. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether they used adfind or not.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
