 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) that Infamous Chisel uses, as described in the CTI outline. The question asks about Command and Control capabilities, but we don't see any direct mention of SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, or an SSH server and client in the CTI outline. However, we do know that Infamous Chisel uses SSH connections for exfiltration.

The TTPs related to Command and Control typically involve establishing a connection between the attacker and the compromised device, which allows the attacker to issue commands, receive data, and maintain persistence on the device. While Infamous Chisel does not explicitly provide SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, or an SSH server and client, it does use SSH connections for exfiltration, which suggests that it might have some Command and Control capabilities.

However, the CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively say whether Infamous Chisel provides SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, or an SSH server and client. Therefore, the answer is not straightforward based on the given information.

Final Answer: It is not possible to definitively say "Yes" or "No" based on the provided information.
