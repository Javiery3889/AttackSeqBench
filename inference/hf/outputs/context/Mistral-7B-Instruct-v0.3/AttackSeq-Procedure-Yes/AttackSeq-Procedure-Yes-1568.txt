 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Turla uses PowerShell to run malware in memory.
   - Persistence: Turla uses WMI and PowerShell profile for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Turla encrypts payloads, obfuscates scripts, and uses an AMSI bypass technique.
   - Discovery: Turla uses RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor for lateral movement and control. RPC backdoor supports plugins for gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives. PowerStallion monitors antimalware logs and the Windows process list.
   - Command and Control: RPC backdoor uses RPC protocol, while PowerStallion uses OneDrive as its command and control server.
   - Exfiltration: PowerStallion exfiltrates information through OneDrive.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about Turla's likely actions during the collection phase, specifically whether it will use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase in the CTI outline shows that Turla's RPC backdoor supports plugins for gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives. This aligns with the question's focus on collecting files and files from USB drives.
   - The Collection phase is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but given that the Discovery phase includes the capability to collect files and information, it is reasonable to assume that Turla would continue to use these capabilities during the Collection phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The RPC backdoor, which Turla used during the Discovery phase, supports plugins for gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives. Given the continuity of Turla's operations and the capabilities of its tools, it is likely that Turla will use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the Collection phase.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
