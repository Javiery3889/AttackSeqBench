 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email attachment, .src file, decoy document, malware execution.
   - Execution: The malware allows the operator to execute arbitrary code on the infected host.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the sequence of TTPs after Initial Access, which is Execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the KONNI malware executes arbitrary code on the infected host after Initial Access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After the Initial Access, the KONNI malware displays a decoy document and executes on the victim's machine. The question asks if it is likely that the KONNI malware will move to execute arbitrary code on the infected host before achieving persistence. Since the CTI outline confirms that the malware does execute arbitrary code on the infected host, the answer is "Yes". Persistence methods such as creating a shortcut or naming a Windows shortcut as "adobe distillist.lnk" are not mentioned in the CTI outline, so they are not relevant to the question.
