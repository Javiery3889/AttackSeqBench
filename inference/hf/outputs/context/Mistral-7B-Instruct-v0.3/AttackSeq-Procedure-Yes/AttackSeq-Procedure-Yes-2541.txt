 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Deep Panda gained initial access through the exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers and spawned PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts.
   - Persistence: Deep Panda ensured persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a registry-based service named msupdate2.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that after gaining initial access and spawning PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts, it asks if it is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Deep Panda, after gaining initial access, spawned PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts. The question asks if it is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks before ensuring persistence. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that Deep Panda executed a batch file, but it does mention that they executed a chain of scripts. Given that PowerShell scripts are a type of script, it is plausible that some of these scripts could be PowerShell scripts. Therefore, it is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts before ensuring persistence.
   - The question also asks if it is likely that Deep Panda will download and run additional files before ensuring persistence. The CTI outline does not provide explicit evidence of this, but given that the initial access was gained through downloading and executing scripts, it is reasonable to assume that Deep Panda may download and run additional files as part of their attack sequence.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. It is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and potentially download and run additional files before ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a registry-based service named msupdate2.
