 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets, as seen in the case of the Plexor malware infection via a Word document (CVE-2014-4148).
   - Discovery: Longhorn's malware has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - Collection: Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - Command and Control: Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, including privacy services, custom cryptographic protocols, and selective communication times.
   - Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, including privacy services, custom cryptographic protocols, selective communication times, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection (Command and Control, Exfiltration). This aligns with the question's focus on tactics to avoid detection.
   - After initial access, it is likely that Longhorn would perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware, as seen in the Discovery and Collection sections of the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware. Therefore, it is likely that they follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
