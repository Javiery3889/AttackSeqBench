 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Konni APT Group initiated their attack by delivering an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL. This ISO file contained a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - Initial Access: Delivering an ISO file from an ITW URL

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the sequence of TTPs between Initial Access and Persistence. The question mentions VBScripts and batch files such as 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat'.
   - Initial Access: Delivering an ISO file from an ITW URL
   - Persistence: Scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes via 'stopedge.bat'

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline mentions that the ISO file contained a zip file with malicious scripts, which includes 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat'. The question asks if it is likely that these scripts will execute as part of the attack sequence. Since the scripts are part of the initial ISO file, it is plausible that they will execute before achieving persistence.

4. Conclusion: The question asks if it is likely that various VBScripts and batch files such as 'install.vbs' will execute scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' as part of their attack sequence. However, the CTI outline does not mention 'resolve.dns' as part of the attack sequence. Therefore, while it is likely that 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' will execute, it is not certain that 'resolve.dns' will be part of the sequence. Since the question asks about the likelihood of 'install.vbs' and 'stopedge.bat' executing scripts, the answer is 'Yes'.
