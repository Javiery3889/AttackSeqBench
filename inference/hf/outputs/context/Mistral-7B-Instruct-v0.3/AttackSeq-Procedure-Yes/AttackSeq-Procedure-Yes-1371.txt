 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - In the Reconnaissance phase, WINDSHIFT APT uses social media platforms for long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates during the Credential Access phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, during the Initial Access phase, WINDSHIFT APT sends emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset from various services and uses SMS to redirect to credential harvesting pages. These pages employ HTTPS with free SSL certificates.
   - The Reconnaissance phase is not directly related to the Credential Access phase, but the long-term monitoring and tracking activities in the Reconnaissance phase provide valuable information for the Initial Access phase, including understanding the targets' email habits and click behavior, which can be exploited in the Credential Access phase.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates during the Credential Access phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
