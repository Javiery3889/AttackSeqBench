 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by Elfin as described in the CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (Exploitation)
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Command and Control (using POSHC2, Quasar RAT, etc.)

The question asks about the likelihood of Elfin exfiltrating data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader after establishing command and control. However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about Elfin using a custom .NET FTP tool or FastUploader for data exfiltration.

Therefore, based on the provided CTI outline, it is not possible to definitively say whether Elfin used a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader for data exfiltration after establishing command and control.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
