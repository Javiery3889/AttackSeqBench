 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The attack is targeting user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
   - Execution: The attack delivers the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file, which executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
   - Persistence: The PowerShell script includes features for creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses a VMProtect packer to make analysis difficult.
   - Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials and access Outlook info.
   - Collection: The malware collects email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors.
   - Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains.
   - Exfiltration: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated to the cyber actors.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that the attack delivers a .bat file that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level (Execution). After that, the PowerShell script includes features for creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks (Persistence). Therefore, it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

4. Answer Choices:
   - A: Yes - This answer choice aligns best with the attack sequence and contextual information provided in the CTI Outline. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
