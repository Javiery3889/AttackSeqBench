 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
   - Execution: T9000 sideloaded a malicious DLL and initiated the next stage of execution.
   - Persistence: T9000 established persistence through registry keys and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe.
   - Defense Evasion: T9000 customized its installation and used evasion techniques to avoid detection.
   - Collection: T9000 collected data about the infected system and stole files, including Skype communications.
   - Command and Control: T9000 communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that T9000 will compress and encrypt the data it has collected during the collection phase before exfiltration over a C2 channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that T9000 collects data, including Skype communications, during the collection phase.
   - The malware communicates with a C2 server, which implies that it sends data to the C2 server.
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the data is compressed and encrypted before exfiltration, the malware's use of a binary protocol and encryption for its traffic suggests that it may compress and encrypt the data before sending it over the C2 channel.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that T9000 will compress and encrypt the data it has collected during the collection phase before exfiltration over a command and control (C2) channel. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
