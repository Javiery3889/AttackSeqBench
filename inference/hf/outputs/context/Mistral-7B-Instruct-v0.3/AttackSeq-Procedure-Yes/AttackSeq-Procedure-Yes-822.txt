 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN4 targets individuals and organizations in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.
   - Resource Development: FIN4 labels the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes'.
   - Initial Access: FIN4 gains initial access to their targets' information through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros or fake OWA login pages.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to delete emails containing certain keywords.
   - Command and Control: FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials from their phishing campaigns.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN4 is likely to use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials before transmitting those credentials to their C2 servers for credential access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros for Initial Access, and they also transmit the stolen credentials to their C2 servers during Command and Control. Therefore, it is likely that FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials before transmitting those credentials to their C2 servers for credential access.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. FIN4 is likely to use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials before transmitting those credentials to their C2 servers for credential access.
