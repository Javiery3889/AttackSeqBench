 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question and the CTI outline both mention the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, and the exploitation of CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome. Therefore, the answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence and contextual information is "Yes".

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline starts with Initial Access, where malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome. Therefore, it is likely that this sequence of events occurred before the attackers utilized heap spraying techniques and executed an embedded shellcode payload. Final Answer: Yes.
