 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Gallmaker delivered malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails to exploit the DDE protocol for commands in memory.
   - Execution: Gallmaker executed various tools, including PowerShell scripts and tasks, a Metasploit payload, WinZip console, and Rex PowerShell library.
   - Command and Control: Gallmaker used IP addresses for C&C infrastructure and likely used the WinZip console for data exfiltration.
   - Exfiltration: Gallmaker used the legitimate version of the WinZip console to archive data for exfiltration.
   - Others: Gallmaker used LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Gallmaker is likely to use LotL tactics and remove tools from the victim’s machines after executing PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads for defense evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that Gallmaker used LotL tactics (WinZip console, Rex PowerShell library) and removed tools from the victim’s machines (WinZip console for data exfiltration).
   - The question's answer choice A: Yes aligns best with the attack sequence and the contextual information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the final answer is A: Yes.
