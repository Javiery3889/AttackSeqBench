 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs.
   - Persistence: VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Blind Eagle's attack sequence involves a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs for initial access, followed by a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs. The persistence stage involves a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat.
   - The question's sequence of TTPs matches the attack sequence in the CTI outline.

4. Conclusion:
   - The question asks if Blind Eagle's attack sequence involves the use of a JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands hosted on Discord CDNs for initial access before leveraging a VBScript in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat for persistence. Since the CTI outline confirms this sequence, the final answer is "Yes".
