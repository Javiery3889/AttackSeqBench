 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
   - Persistence: APT35 maintained a foothold within the system through persistent C2 beaconing.
   - Discovery: Darktrace's Cyber AI began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected.
   - Lateral Movement: No lateral movement or data exfiltration was detected following the C2 beaconing.
   - Command and Control: Darktrace detected APT35's C2 activity.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Darktrace's Cyber AI began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected (Discovery phase). This analysis was automated, as stated in the CTI outline.
   - The question asks if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process following the Command and Control detection, which aligns with the Discovery phase in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that Darktrace's Cyber AI began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected (Discovery phase), which was an automated process.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection (Final Answer: Yes).
