 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: SocGholish framework used for initial compromise.
   - Initial Access: Initial compromise involved SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - Execution: Cobalt Strike deployed using PowerShell for execution.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers indeed deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, which aligns with the question. However, the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of "whoami", "net user", and "net group" commands for discovery.
   - While the CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of the use of these specific commands, it does indicate that the attackers used PowerShell for discovery-related activities, as they downloaded additional PowerShell scripts for profiling the computer. It is plausible that these commands or similar ones were used for discovery purposes.

4. Conclusion:
   - Given the context of the CTI outline and the plausibility of the attackers using discovery commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group", the most likely answer is "Yes". The attackers are likely to deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and use commands for discovery, even though the specific commands mentioned in the question are not explicitly stated in the CTI outline.
