 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: FIN13 deploys web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
   - Execution: FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline mentions that FIN13 uses various methods for reconnaissance, including native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. This aligns with the question's focus on gathering victim network information.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question (Reconnaissance, Execution) is also present in the CTI Outline (Initial Access, Execution).

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline and the question, it is likely that FIN13 will gather victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
