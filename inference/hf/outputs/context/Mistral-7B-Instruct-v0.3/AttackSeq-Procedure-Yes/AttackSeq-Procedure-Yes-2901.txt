 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.
   - Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - Collection: APT15 used various tools to collect data from different sources, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
   - The question then asks if it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT15 indeed deployed backdoors, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.
   - The question mentions the use of RoyalCLI for bypassing command prompt policy settings, which aligns with the CTI outline where RoyalCLI is described as a backdoor that bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access (Collection and Credential Access).
   - APT15 then deployed backdoors, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS (Execution).
   - RoyalCLI was used to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution (Defense Evasion).
   - Therefore, it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution (Answer Choice A).
