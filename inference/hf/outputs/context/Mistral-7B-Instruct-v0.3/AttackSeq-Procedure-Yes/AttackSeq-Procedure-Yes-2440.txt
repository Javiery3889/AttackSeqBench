 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malware distribution through a malicious Microsoft Word document, exploiting CVE-2017-11882.
   - Execution: Injects NavShExt.dll into the Internet Explorer process, creates a mutex 'donotbotherme'.
   - Persistence: Uses Run Registry key, injects DLLs with anti-analysis functionalities into iexplore.exe.
   - Discovery: Harvests system information, including IP addresses, installed software, process enumeration, and file list.
   - Command and Control: Communicates with a hardcoded C2 server, sending and receiving data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After injecting the NavShExt.dll into the Internet Explorer process and creating a mutex 'donotbotherme', the question asks if it is likely that the Elise malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware uses anti-analysis functionalities by injecting DLLs into the Internet Explorer process (iexplore.exe) to provide loading and anti-analysis functionalities. This indicates that the malware may employ defense evasion techniques.
   - The malware also encrypts logs using a static AES key, which can be considered obfuscation.
   - The malware's capability to provide a remote shell on the host and completely uninstall itself suggests that it may have heavy anti-virtual-machine features, as these capabilities are often used to evade analysis in virtual environments.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that the Elise malware will employ defense evasion techniques such as heavy anti-virtual-machine features and obfuscation while exfiltrating data to the C2 server. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
