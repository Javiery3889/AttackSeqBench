 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Scripting, Batch files, VBScript, rundll32, CreateProcess, C&C servers
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry modifications, code signing, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates
   - Discovery: Automatic listing of interesting files
   - Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for emailing attachments
   - Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for C&C
   - Exfiltration: Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server
   - Others: The group's backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration. This suggests that they are indeed searching for and collecting sensitive documents.

4. Final Answer: Yes
