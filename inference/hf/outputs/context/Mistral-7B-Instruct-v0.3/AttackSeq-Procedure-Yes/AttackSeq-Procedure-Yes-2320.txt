 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Shamoon malware was deployed and executed as a scheduled job.
   - Execution: Shamoon malware executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job, drops a driver for disk access, and overwrites data on disks.
   - Persistence: Shamoon entrenches itself as a service on the infected system.
   - Command and Control: Shamoon malware has no known command and control communication.
   - Impact: Shamoon malware overwrites data on disks, including the contents of the Documents and Settings and Windows\system32 directories, but it does not overwrite the Volume Boot Record.
   - Others: Recovery efforts were successful due to the malware's inability to completely wipe the disk before the infected host restarted, allowing for the recovery of the majority of files outside of the System32 and Documents and Settings folders.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will overwrite the Volume Boot Record as part of its Defense Evasion tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that Shamoon malware overwrites data on disks, but it does not specify that it overwrites the Volume Boot Record.
   - The question asks about the Defense Evasion tactic, but the CTI outline does not indicate that Shamoon uses Defense Evasion tactics to overwrite the Volume Boot Record.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence that Shamoon malware overwrites the Volume Boot Record as part of its Defense Evasion tactic. Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will overwrite the Volume Boot Record.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
