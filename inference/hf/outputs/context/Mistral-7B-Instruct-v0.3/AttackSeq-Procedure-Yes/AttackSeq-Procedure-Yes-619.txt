 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscation techniques within the VBS script and self-deletion after execution
   - Command and Control: VBS script communicates with a C&C server and downloads additional payloads
   - Persistence: VBS script registers a RUN key in the Windows registry

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after initial access, the attackers use a VBS script, which is likely the "PlayList.vbs" mentioned in the question. The VBS script is executed using 'wscript.exe'.
   - The VBS script's obfuscation techniques and self-deletion are defense evasion techniques, but they do not directly relate to the question.
   - The persistence tactic, registering a RUN key in the Windows registry, is not mentioned as the immediate action after the VBS script execution but is a subsequent action.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining initial access through malicious document files, the attackers execute a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe'. This sequence is described in the CTI outline.
   - The persistence tactic (registering a RUN key in the Windows registry) is a subsequent action, not the immediate action after the VBS script execution.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the group will execute a macro code that runs a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe' before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
