 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Agrius exploited public-facing applications and uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
   - Execution: Agrius deployed a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
   - Persistence: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering its custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
   - Defense Evasion: Agrius used webshells and obfuscated backdoors to evade defenses.
   - Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - Impact: Agrius used various wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, but the question does not mention RDP tunneling or compromised accounts for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access via vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Agrius uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP after gaining initial access. This aligns with the question's requirement of using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic.
   - The question does not mention compromised accounts for lateral movement, but the CTI outline does not explicitly rule out this possibility. However, the outline does not provide evidence that Agrius leveraged compromised accounts for lateral movement.
   - The question asks about communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP, which aligns with the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access, Agrius uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP (as per the CTI outline). This would allow them to tunnel RDP traffic.
   - Agrius did not necessarily leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement, but the CTI outline does not rule out this possibility.
   - Agrius communicates with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP (as per the CTI outline).

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is:
   - After exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access, Agrius uses webshells for tunneling RDP traffic.
   - Agrius may or may not leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement.
   - Agrius communicates with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

Final Answer: Yes (Agrius is likely to use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP, but the CTI outline does not provide evidence that compromised accounts were used for lateral movement).
