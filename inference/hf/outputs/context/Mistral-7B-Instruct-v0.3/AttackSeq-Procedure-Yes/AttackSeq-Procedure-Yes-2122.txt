 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: SSL-VPN abuse
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through DESLoader
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks to load DESLoader every 15 minutes
   - Defense Evasion: Fileless implants, DLL side-loading, event log removal, obfuscated PowerShell commands
   - Credential Access: Internal network scanning, dumping credentials from AD, file, and backup servers
   - Discovery: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC, deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships
   - Command and Control: Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting, IP addresses over domains for C2 infrastructure, little reuse of IP addresses for C2

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network after conducting discovery activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the A41APT campaign conducted discovery activities, including scanning for open RDP and SMB ports and deploying tools to discover domain accounts. This indicates that the attackers have identified potential targets for lateral movement.
   - The attackers have already demonstrated the use of RDP to deploy to servers (as mentioned in the Credential Access section). Given that they have identified potential targets and have used RDP in the past, it is plausible that they will utilize RDP for lateral movement within the network.

4. Final Answer: A: Yes
