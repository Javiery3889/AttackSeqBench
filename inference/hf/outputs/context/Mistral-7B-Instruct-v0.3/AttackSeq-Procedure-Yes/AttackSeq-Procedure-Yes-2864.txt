 To answer this question, we need to analyze the CTI outline and the question to determine if there is any evidence of establishing a Command and Control (C2) channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the malware decrypts a multi-stage payload, which includes a DLL file (CBkdr.dll). However, the outline does not provide any information about the malware establishing a C2 channel or sending encrypted and encoded system information via HTTPS POST requests.

The question asks about the likelihood of the malware establishing a C2 channel after modifying the CCleaner binary and decrypting the multi-stage payload. Since the CTI outline does not provide any evidence of this activity, it is not likely that the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

Final Answer: B: No.
