 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB for lateral movement.

Final Answer: B: No
