 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Scanning for predefined ports, IP addresses, and mapping the internal network (Discovery using 'PORT.EXE' and 'STSRCheck').
2. Performing pass-the-hash attacks for lateral movement.
3. Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for command and control.

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery phase involves using 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE', which aligns with the first step in our question. However, the question does not explicitly mention any other TTPs from the CTI outline after Discovery.

The question asks if it is likely that the Fox Kitten Campaign will use 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks and then establish RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for command and control.

From the CTI outline, we know that the Fox Kitten Campaign uses 'Invoke the Hash' for credential access, but it does not explicitly state that they use it for lateral movement. Regarding the use of 'POWSSHNET' for command and control, it is mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is not clear if it is used after pass-the-hash attacks.

Given the information available, it is not possible to definitively say whether the Fox Kitten Campaign will use 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks and then establish RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for command and control. Therefore, the most plausible answer is "It cannot be determined based on the provided information."

Final Answer: It cannot be determined based on the provided information.
