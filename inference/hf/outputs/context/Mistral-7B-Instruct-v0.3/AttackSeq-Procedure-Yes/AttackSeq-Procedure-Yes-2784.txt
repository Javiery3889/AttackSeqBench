 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (malware) is installed on compromised systems.
   - Execution: The malware runs in the background, hides its icon, and restarts if terminated (except on iOS 8).
   - Discovery: The malware collects various types of information from the device.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the Command and Control phase activities after the Discovery phase. The TTPs mentioned are sending information, writing log messages, using a token for communication, and uploading files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware performs these specific TTPs during the Command and Control phase. However, given that the malware collects information during the Discovery phase, it is reasonable to assume that it would send this information to a command and control server for further action. The malware's ability to restart and hide its icon suggests it may have a means of communication, possibly a token. The malware's collection of geo-location data also implies it might have the capability to upload files, such as the collected data, to a server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware collects information during the Discovery phase.
   - It is likely that the malware would send this information, write log messages, use a token for communication, and upload files during the Command and Control phase, as these activities are common in malware behavior.
   - Final Answer: Yes (Answer Choice A)
