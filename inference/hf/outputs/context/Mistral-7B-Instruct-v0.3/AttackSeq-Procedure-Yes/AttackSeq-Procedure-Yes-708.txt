 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Deployment of updated malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe)
   - Defense Evasion: Aumlib encodes HTTP POST body, Ixeshe uses different Base64 encoding pattern in network traffic
   - Others: APT12 re-emerged with improved malware, changes in TTPs suggest a response to external pressures

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of Aumlib downloading its updated sample from specific URLs and sharing code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions the deployment of updated malware (Aumlib and Ixeshe) and the use of encoding techniques to evade detection. However, it does not provide information about downloading updated samples from specific URLs or sharing code with older variants.
   - The question does not directly match any specific tactic or technique mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline provides information about the deployment of updated malware and the use of encoding techniques to evade detection. However, it does not provide any evidence to suggest that Aumlib downloads its updated sample from specific URLs or shares code with an older variant.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of these actions, but without evidence from the CTI outline, it is not possible to definitively say whether these actions are likely or not.
   - Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
