 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker uses a spear-phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word .DOC file to install the main module "net.exe".
   - Persistence: The malware installs the main C&C module "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service and uses mutexes to prevent multiple instances.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicates with C&C servers, but there is no mention of an encryption scheme for the configuration or C&C servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware using an encryption scheme for its configuration or C&C servers.
   - Answer choice A suggests that the malware will use encryption, but the CTI outline does not support this claim.
   - Answer choice B suggests that the malware will not use encryption, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
