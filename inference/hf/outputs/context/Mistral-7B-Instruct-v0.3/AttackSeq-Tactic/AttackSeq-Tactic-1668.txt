 To answer this question, we need to identify the ATT&CK tactic that would enable Regin to use various remote access Trojan (RAT) features such as capturing screenshots and stealing passwords.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Regin has capabilities for credential access (stealing passwords) and command and control (initiating communications with compromised computers to use RAT features). However, the tactic that would allow Regin to perform these actions remotely is the Command and Control tactic.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Regin's command-and-control (C&C) operations are extensive and bidirectional, allowing attackers to initiate communications with compromised computers or vice versa.
2. Compromised computers can serve as a proxy for other infections, and C&C can happen in a peer-to-peer fashion.
3. All communications are strongly encrypted and can use transport protocols such as ICMP, UDP, TCP, and HTTP.
4. The C&C operations are undertaken by various modules, including major groups C373h, 19h, 9, as well as Stage 5 payloads, such as C375h and 1Bh.

These details suggest that Regin's command and control tactic is what enables it to use various RAT features remotely, including capturing screenshots and stealing passwords.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control.
