 Final Answer: C: Execution

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker uses spambots to send malicious documents that, when opened, execute the Dridex payload.
   - Execution: The Dridex malware consists of a loader and a payload, which is executed after the initial access.
   - Command and Control: Dridex communicates with its command and control servers after execution.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before Dridex malware communicated with its command and control servers via encrypted POST requests.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline is Initial Access -> Execution -> Command and Control.
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred before Command and Control.
   - The only answer choice that aligns with this sequence is Execution, as it is the tactic that occurs between Initial Access and Command and Control.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access -> Execution -> Command and Control, and the answer is C: Execution.
