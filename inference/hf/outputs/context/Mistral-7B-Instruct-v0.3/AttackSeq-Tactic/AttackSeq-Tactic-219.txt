 Final Answer: D: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments were used to gain initial access.
   - Command and Control: The EyePyramid malware communicated with C&C servers to exfiltrate stolen data.
   - Others: The stolen data was then exfiltrated using email addresses such as gpool@hostpenta[.]com.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after the EyePyramid malware established communication with C&C servers to exfiltrate stolen data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware communicated with C&C servers for data exfiltration, and the question asks about the tactic that occurred after this event.
   - The answer choices are all tactics that could potentially follow Initial Access, but only Exfiltration (D) directly follows the Command and Control tactic, which is the tactic mentioned in the CTI outline after Initial Access.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is Initial Access -> Command and Control -> Exfiltration. The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after the Command and Control tactic, so the answer is D: Exfiltration.
