 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker gains initial access to the iOS device through a poisoned pawn (malware).
   - Execution: The malware runs in the background and collects information.
   - Discovery: The malware collects various types of information, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred to send the collected data out via HTTP and receive commands from the attacker.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Command and Control (B) involves the establishment of a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system, allowing the attacker to send commands and receive data. In this case, the malware collects information and sends it out via HTTP, which is a common method for Command and Control communication.
   - Reconnaissance (A) is about gathering information about the target or environment, but it does not involve sending the collected data out via HTTP or receiving commands.
   - Resource Development (C) is about building resources for future attacks, such as creating malware or recruiting insiders, but it does not involve sending data out via HTTP or receiving commands.
   - Discovery (D) is about identifying and cataloging information on the compromised system, but it does not involve sending the collected data out via HTTP or receiving commands.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Command and Control.
