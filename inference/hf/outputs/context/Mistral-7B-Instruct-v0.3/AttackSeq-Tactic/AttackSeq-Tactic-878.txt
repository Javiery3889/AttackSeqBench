 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactics that occur after the initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon and before the gathering of Active Directory information with tools like ADFind.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the following tactics are relevant:
1. Defense Evasion: This tactic is used to bypass detection by security products after the initial compromise.
2. Lateral Movement: This tactic is used to propagate beacons to other systems within the network, which could be performed before gathering Active Directory information.

However, Defense Evasion is more likely to occur immediately after the initial compromise to ensure the beacon remains undetected, while Lateral Movement is more about moving within the network, which could be performed after Defense Evasion and before gathering Active Directory information.

So, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the initial compromise using Cobalt Strike's beacon and before they gathered Active Directory information with tools like ADFind is:

Final Answer: Lateral Movement.
