 Final Answer: A: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Delivering Gh0st RAT via email.
   - Defense Evasion: DLL side-loading and embedding Tetris for evasion.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Initial Access tactic involves gaining access to a system, which is the first step in the attack chain. After Initial Access, the actors would typically move on to Defense Evasion tactics to hide their presence and maintain persistence on the compromised system. Therefore, it is most likely that the Initial Access tactic occurred before the Defense Evasion tactic.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Initial Access. The Initial Access tactic most likely occurred between delivering Gh0st RAT via email and employing DLL side-loading techniques to load a malicious DLL.
