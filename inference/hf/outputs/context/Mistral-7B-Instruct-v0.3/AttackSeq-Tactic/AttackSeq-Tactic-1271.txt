 To answer this question, we need to compare the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question with the attack sequence identified in the CTI outline.

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance
   - Initial Access
   - Execution
   - Persistence
   - Privilege Escalation
   - Defense Evasion
   - Discovery
   - Lateral Movement
   - Command and Control

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions TG1021 actively interfering with logging mechanisms to evade detection (Defense Evasion) and using publicly available offensive security tools for target mapping and reconnaissance (Discovery).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, Defense Evasion occurs before Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection (Defense Evasion) before using publicly available offensive security tools for target mapping and reconnaissance (Discovery).
   - Final Answer: Defense Evasion.
