 Final Answer: B: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Taidoor malware is delivered via email attachment, which is the Initial Access tactic according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before delivering the Taidoor malware via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).
3. Compare and Evaluate: The Initial Access tactic (B) is the only tactic that directly involves the delivery of the malware, which is the first step in the attack sequence. The other tactics (Discovery, Reconnaissance, and Credential Access) do not involve the delivery of the malware.

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred before delivering the Taidoor malware via a spear-phishing email attachment exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) is the Initial Access tactic (B).
