 Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attackers obfuscated their malicious code and appended it to the end of the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file, which is a Defense Evasion tactic (T1571.001).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the attackers obfuscated their malicious code after gaining access to the CDN server and modifying the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file. This obfuscation is a Defense Evasion tactic.
   - The other tactics (Initial Access, Command and Control, Resource Development) do not directly relate to the obfuscation of the malicious code.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:
   - Initial Access (to gain access to the CDN server)
   - Command and Control (to maintain communication with the attackers)
   - Defense Evasion (to obfuscate the malicious code)

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the strategic web compromise, so we can eliminate Initial Access and Command and Control as they occurred before the web compromise. Resource Development is not directly related to the strategic web compromise, so the most plausible answer is Defense Evasion.
