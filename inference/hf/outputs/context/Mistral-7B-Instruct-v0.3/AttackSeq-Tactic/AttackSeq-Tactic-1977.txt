 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails with attached executables are used to deploy the Gh0st malware.
   - Persistence: The malware creates a registry entry to maintain persistence on infected systems.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses a self-extracting executable (SFW) to conceal the Gh0st payload and executes the embedded DLL of the Trojan.
   - Others: The malware establishes communication using a custom network protocol through its server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that occurred after the malware evaded defenses and established communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware establishes communication after evading defenses. The only tactic that aligns with this sequence is Command and Control (C2).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After evading defenses by using a self-extracting wrapper file and executing the embedded DLL of the Trojan, the malware establishes communication using a custom network protocol through its server. This action most likely occurred next, making the tactic of Command and Control (C) the most plausible answer.
