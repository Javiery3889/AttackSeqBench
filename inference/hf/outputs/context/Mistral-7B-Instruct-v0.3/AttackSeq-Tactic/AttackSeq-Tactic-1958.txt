 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Execution -> Defense Evasion.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the establishment of contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence in the question (initial HTTP GET requests) is part of the Defense Evasion tactic, but it is more closely related to the Command and Control tactic as it represents the initial connection between the malware and the C2 server. The Defense Evasion tactic is used to avoid detection, but it does not directly involve the initial connection with the C2 server. Lateral Movement is not applicable in this context as it involves moving within a network, not establishing a connection with a C2 server. Collection is not directly related to the initial connection with the C2 server.

Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred when ZoxPNG established contact with the C2 server via initial HTTP GET requests is Command and Control (C).
