 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question and compare it with the attack sequence from the CTI outline.

From the question, we can see that the sequence of TTPs is: Persistence (registering variations of the loader-type malware for auto-execution) -> Credential Access (harvesting credentials using the Responder tool).

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Credential Access
6. Discovery
7. Lateral Movement
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

From the CTI outline, we can see that Persistence and Credential Access are consecutive TTPs in the attack sequence. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the same as the sequence in the CTI outline between Persistence and Credential Access.

Final Answer: The ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Lazarus group achieved persistence by registering variations of the loader-type malware for auto-execution and before they harvested credentials using the Responder tool is "Credential Access".
