 Final Answer: C: Privilege Escalation

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. In the CTI outline, the attackers gained initial access through phishing emails and created backdoors on compromised systems.
2. After gaining initial access, the attackers identified bank employee accounts on the card management application with authorization to request and approve changes to customer debit cards. This action suggests that they escalated their privileges to gain access to sensitive information.
3. The tactic of Privilege Escalation (MITRE ATT&CK Tactic T1078) involves an attacker exploiting a vulnerability, taking advantage of weak passwords, or using stolen credentials to gain higher-level access within a system.
4. The other answer choices do not align with the sequence of events in the CTI outline. Execution (T1053) refers to the act of running a command, script, or program on a target system, which occurs after the attackers have gained access and installed malicious tools. Command and Control (T1071) is the tactic used to maintain communication between the attacker and compromised systems, which happens after the attackers have moved laterally within the network. Collection (T1005) is the tactic used to gather data from a compromised system, which in this case, occurs after the attackers have executed malicious payloads and captured full information from the processor's Terminal Server.
