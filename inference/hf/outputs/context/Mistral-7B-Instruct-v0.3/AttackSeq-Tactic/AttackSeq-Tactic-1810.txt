 Final Answer: B: Collection

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access > Execution > Persistence > Defense Evasion > Credential Access > Collection > Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the attackers establishing a mechanism to upload the stolen credentials to an external FTP server, which is a part of the Exfiltration phase in the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the attackers uploaded the stolen credentials to an external FTP server. The answer choices do not directly relate to the Exfiltration phase, but we can infer that the Collection tactic is most likely the one that prepared the stolen credentials for transmission, as it mentions the recurrent collection of credentials every hour. The other tactics do not involve the transmission of stolen data.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Collection.
