 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email-based spear phishing with malicious attachments
   - Execution: PoisonIvy Trojan installation and communication with C&C server
   - Credential Access: Dumping Windows cached password hashes
   - Lateral Movement: Using obtained credentials to move within the network
   - Collection: Gathering intellectual property for exfiltration
   - Exfiltration: Uploading collected data to a remote site

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that describes how the compromised systems maintained communication with a server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the PoisonIvy Trojan contacted a C&C server using an encrypted communication protocol over TCP port 80. This is the Command and Control tactic as defined by MITRE ATT&CK.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers used the PoisonIvy Trojan to establish communication with a C&C server for receiving commands and retrieving binary code. This is the Command and Control tactic as defined by MITRE ATT&CK.
   - Final Answer: C: Command and Control
