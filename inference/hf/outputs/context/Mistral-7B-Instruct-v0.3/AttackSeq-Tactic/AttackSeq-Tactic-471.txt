 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that would allow the CopyKittens group to establish a foothold in the target system before deploying their multi-stage infection framework 'Matryoshka'.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Initial Access tactic was used to gain entry into the target system through spear-phishing emails containing infected document files. This tactic allows the attackers to establish a connection with the target system, making it the most likely tactic to occur before the deployment of the Matryoshka framework.

Final Answer: A: Initial Access.
