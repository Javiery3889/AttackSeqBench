 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The initial access is achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document that contains encrypted script data and an external template. The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services, and the VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data from the original document and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access through the delivery of a malicious Microsoft Word document and before employing techniques to hinder analysis and detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The PowerShell scripts decoding and executing additional scripts to generate the Bandook malware payload is a part of the initial access phase, as it is the next step after the initial access is gained through the malicious Microsoft Word document. The other tactics mentioned in the answer choices (Privilege Escalation, Execution, Command and Control) do not occur before the PowerShell scripts are decoded and executed.

Therefore, the most likely answer is C: Initial Access.
