 Final Answer: D: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (deployment of the malicious payload), Execution (loading and running the payload), Command and Control (establishing a C2 connection).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic most likely involved in the deployment of "Listeners" (which can be interpreted as C2 servers in this context).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the deployment of the C2 server (beacon.dll) is part of the Command and Control tactic. However, the question asks for the tactic most likely involved in the deployment of the C2 servers (Listeners).
   - The Initial Access tactic is the most likely candidate for deploying the initial payload, which includes the configuration for the C2 server. Once the initial payload is deployed, it establishes a connection with the C2 server during the Command and Control phase.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: D: Initial Access. This tactic is most likely involved in the deployment of "Listeners" (C2 servers) as it sets up the initial connection and configuration for the C2 method used in the attack.
