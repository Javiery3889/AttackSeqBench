 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline and then find the tactic that most likely occurred before the obfuscation of scripts.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access (using a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro)
2. Execution (triggered by enabling the macro, which executes PowerShell scripts)
3. Defense Evasion (obfuscation of the macro scripts to facilitate the PRB-Backdoor payload)
4. Command and Control (communication with the C&C server for various purposes)

Given this sequence, the tactic that most likely occurred before the defense evasion is Initial Access, as it is the first step in the attack chain.

Final Answer: A: Defense Evasion
