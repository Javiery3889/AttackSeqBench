 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events in the CTI outline and the question.

1. Initial Access: The malware infects the system and removable media.
2. Execution: The malware operates and collects data.
3. Defense Evasion: The malware cleans up after itself and deletes itself after a hardcoded date.
4. Discovery: The malware collects detailed system information.
5. Collection: The malware collects data in the form of files.
6. Command and Control: Command and control is accomplished via commands in an encrypted file on the local 'master' system.

The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred following the command and control mechanism being established. In the CTI outline, the collection of data occurs after the command and control mechanism is established. Therefore, the most likely tactic that followed the command and control mechanism is the Collection tactic.

Final Answer: A: Exfiltration (since it is the tactic that follows Collection in the sequence of events)
