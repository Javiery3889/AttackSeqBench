 Final Answer: B: Discovery

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Discovery, Command and Control, Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions a sequence of TTPs where CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns.

3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, the Discovery tactic is the one where CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns. The other tactics do not involve searching for files.

4. The Discovery tactic is the one that most likely occurred after CosmicDuke searched for files on both hard drives and network drives that matched specific patterns, including various non-English filenames related to encryption ciphers. Therefore, the answer is B: Discovery.
