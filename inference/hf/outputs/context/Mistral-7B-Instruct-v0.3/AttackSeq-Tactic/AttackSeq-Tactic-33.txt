 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that typically precedes Initial Access. The Initial Access tactic is the first step in a cyber attack, so it is not likely to have occurred before itself. The tactic that usually precedes Initial Access is Reconnaissance, as attackers often gather information about their targets before attempting to gain access.

In this case, the attack started with phishing emails containing Word documents with embedded VBS macros, which is an example of Initial Access. However, the CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of Reconnaissance being performed before Initial Access. But given that Reconnaissance is a common precursor to Initial Access, it is a reasonable assumption that Reconnaissance likely occurred before the Initial Access tactic in this attack sequence.

Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance.
