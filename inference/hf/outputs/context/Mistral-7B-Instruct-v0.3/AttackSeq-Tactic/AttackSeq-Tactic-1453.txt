 Final Answer: C: Exfiltration

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Execution, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the collection of base64 encoded data from systeminfo, tasklist, and targeted directories using the CryptBinaryToStringA API.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question (collection of data) is part of the Collection tactic in the CTI outline. However, the question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred to transfer this data to the C2 server. In the CTI outline, the malware communicates with the C2 server and sends the exfiltrated data in a POST request, which is part of the Command and Control tactic. But the question specifically asks about the tactic that occurred after the collection of data, which is the Exfiltration tactic.

4. Conclusion: The most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred to transfer the collected data to the C2 server is Exfiltration.
