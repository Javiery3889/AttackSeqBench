 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack started with the delivery of an RTF document, which was exploited to execute the 'OSEA54d.tmp' file. This initial delivery of the payload is the Initial Access phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that occurred involving an RTF document delivering the initial payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline shows that the attack started with an RTF document, which is the initial delivery of the payload. The question asks for the tactic that occurred involving an RTF document delivering the initial payload. The Initial Access tactic is the most appropriate as it describes the initial delivery of a payload, which aligns with the RTF document delivery in the CTI outline.

4. Collection, Execution, and Impact are not directly related to the initial delivery of the payload, making them less plausible choices.
