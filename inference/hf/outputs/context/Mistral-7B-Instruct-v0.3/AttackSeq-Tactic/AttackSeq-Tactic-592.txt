 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers established command and control servers to communicate with the compromised systems.

From the CTI outline, we know that the attackers conducted an extensive search within the compromised networks for other vulnerable systems and sources of intellectual property, specifically targeting the contents of source code repositories after establishing command and control servers. This action aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Discovery".

So, the final answer is: "Discovery".
