 Final Answer: B: Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: Initial Access (Downloading the malicious Word document), Execution (Using Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands), Defense Evasion (Incorporating new techniques to bypass network defenses), Command and Control (Contacting a control server to drop the first stage of the malware), Persistence (Creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the TTP that involved the use of Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute PowerShell commands.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands falls under the Execution tactic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - The malicious Word document is first downloaded (Initial Access), then it uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands (Execution), and later creates persistence on the victim's system. The question asks about the TTP that involved the use of DDE, so the most plausible answer is the tactic that occurred immediately after Initial Access, which is Execution.
