 Final Answer: C: Collection

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: FAKEM RAT is distributed via spear-phishing emails and exploits vulnerabilities to gain access.
   - Persistence: The malware establishes persistence on the compromised system.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware disguises its network traffic and encrypts communication.
   - Command and Control: The RAT controller communicates with the compromised computer using encrypted network communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic most likely to occur involving commands to capture desktop snapshots and access running processes on the compromised system.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Defense Evasion tactic is about disguising network traffic, while Command and Control is about the communication between the RAT controller and the compromised computer. Neither of these tactics directly involves capturing desktop snapshots or accessing running processes.
   - The tactic that most likely involves capturing desktop snapshots and accessing running processes is the Collection tactic, as it encompasses the gathering of data from the compromised system, which could include desktop snapshots and running processes.

4. The question does not explicitly state the sequence of TTPs, but based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that the Collection tactic would occur after Initial Access (exploitation) and before Defense Evasion (disguising network traffic). However, the exact sequence of TTPs might vary depending on the specific behavior of the FAKEM RAT in different instances.
