 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that would typically precede the Initial Access tactic in the attack sequence. The Initial Access tactic in this case is when SideCopy gained access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs.

From the CTI outline, it is clear that SideCopy engages in Reconnaissance activities to target specific individuals and organizations. This includes gathering information about their targets, such as military personnel in India, and creating decoys and honeytraps to lure victims. This Reconnaissance phase provides the necessary intelligence to identify potential targets and plan the attack, making it a logical step before Initial Access.

So, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be: Reconnaissance -> Initial Access. Therefore, the answer to the question is: "Final Answer: Reconnaissance".
