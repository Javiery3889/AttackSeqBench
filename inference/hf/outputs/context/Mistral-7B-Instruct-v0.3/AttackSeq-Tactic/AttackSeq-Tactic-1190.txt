 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that would involve monitoring running processes for a specific executable (MsBuild.exe) before modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery tactic is used by SUNSPOT to monitor running processes for MsBuild.exe. Therefore, it is most likely that the Discovery tactic occurred before SUNSPOT malware modified the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
