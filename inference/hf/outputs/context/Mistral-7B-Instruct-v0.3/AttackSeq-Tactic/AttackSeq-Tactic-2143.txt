 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack started with the Initial Access through a trojanized version of the CCleaner application.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that occurred after gaining initial access but before gathering system profile information.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The Initial Access tactic is the first step in the attack sequence, and it is followed by the Discovery tactic where system profile information is gathered. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred before the Discovery phase. Therefore, the Initial Access tactic is the most plausible answer. The other tactics (Exfiltration and Execution) are not mentioned as occurring before the Discovery phase in the CTI outline.
