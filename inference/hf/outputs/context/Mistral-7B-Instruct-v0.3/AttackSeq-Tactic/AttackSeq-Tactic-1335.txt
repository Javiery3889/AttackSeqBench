 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline and the question, and then compare them to find the most plausible sequence.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. Initial Access: Malicious apps on Google Play exploit CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices.
2. Execution: The callCam app, downloaded by the dropper apps, executes in the background.
3. Privilege Escalation: SideWinder uses two methods for privilege escalation.
4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation are used to evade detection.
5. Discovery: The callCam app collects extensive information from compromised devices.
6. Collection: The collected data is encrypted and sent to the C&C server.
7. Exfiltration: The encrypted data is sent to the C&C server.

From the question, the sequence of TTPs is:
1. Exfiltration: The callCam app encrypts collected data for transmission.

Comparing the sequences, we can see that the question's sequence is the last step in the CTI outline's sequence. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred following the dropper apps downloading exploits and payloads from the C&C server is Exfiltration (Answer Choice C).
