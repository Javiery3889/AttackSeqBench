 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of events that occurred after the adversaries conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and before they used malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery tactic (Step 8: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network) and the Command and Control tactic (Step 5: Establish CC Connection) are not in the correct order. The Discovery tactic occurred during the internal reconnaissance phase, while the Command and Control tactic is when the malware establishes a connection to the attacker-controlled server.

The remaining tactic is Lateral Movement (Step 9: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network). This tactic involves the adversaries using stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems. After this, they would use malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations (which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline but can be inferred as a logical next step).

So, the sequence of events is: Discovery (internal reconnaissance on the control environment), Lateral Movement (using stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems), and then Command and Control (establishing a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to the attacker-controlled CC server).

Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is C: Discovery, followed by B: Command and Control. However, since the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before adversaries used malicious updates to sever connections, the correct answer is C: Discovery.
