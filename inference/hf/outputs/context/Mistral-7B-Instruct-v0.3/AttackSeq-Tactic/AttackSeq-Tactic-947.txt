 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro to execute PowerShell scripts and a backdoor payload.
   - Execution: The macro triggers the execution of the malicious routine, which includes functions to execute sub-functions, manipulate images, and construct PowerShell commands.
   - Persistence: The PowerShell script drops components into the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory and runs the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.
   - Defense Evasion: The campaign employs obfuscation methods for the macro scripts.
   - Others: The attacker targets users through phishing or spam, and the PRB-Backdoor communicates with hxxp://outl00k[.]net to send and receive further commands.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the PRB-Backdoor began communicating with hxxp://outl00k[.]net.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The PRB-Backdoor is the final payload that has been dropped and executed, and it communicates with a command and control server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net). This communication is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PRB-Backdoor is the final payload that has been dropped and executed, and it communicates with a command and control server (hxxp://outl00k[.]net) to send and receive further commands. This communication is a clear example of the Command and Control tactic.
   - Final Answer: B: Command and Control.
