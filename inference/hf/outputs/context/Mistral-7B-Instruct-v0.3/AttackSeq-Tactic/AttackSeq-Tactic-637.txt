 Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The CTI outline provides details about GreyEnergy's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
   - The sequence of TTPs in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be identified as follows: Resource Development, Initial Access (spearphishing and compromised web servers), Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, Command and Control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the tactic should have occurred before Initial Access to target specific systems (ICS control workstations).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Reconnaissance (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1083) is about gathering intelligence on a target before an attack. This tactic can help an attacker identify and prioritize specific systems to target, such as ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - Collection (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1005) is about stealing data from a target, which is not directly related to the strategic targeting of specific systems.
   - Command and Control (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1071) is about maintaining communication with compromised systems, which occurs after Initial Access.
   - Resource Development (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1078) is about creating or acquiring tools, techniques, or infrastructure used in an attack, which is not directly related to the strategic targeting of specific systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The tactic of Reconnaissance (D: Reconnaissance) is the most likely tactic that informed GreyEnergy's strategic targeting of ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers, as it allows them to gather intelligence on the target network and identify specific systems to focus on.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline suggests that Reconnaissance would have occurred before Initial Access, making it the most plausible answer.
