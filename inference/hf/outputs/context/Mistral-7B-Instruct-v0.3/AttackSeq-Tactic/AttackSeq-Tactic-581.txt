 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline and find the tactic that most likely occurred before the JavaScript file executed 'cmd /c ipconfig'.

From the CTI outline, we can see the following sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
1. Initial Access: Higaisa APT group distributed malicious LNK files.
2. Execution: The LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack, including executing a JavaScript file.
3. Persistence: The JavaScript file creates and executes 'd3reEW.exe', copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory, and adds 'svchhast.exe' to scheduled tasks.
4. Defense Evasion: The attack employs a list of commands to bypass security detection.
5. Command and Control: The final shellcode within the attack communicates with a C&C server.

The tactic that most likely occurred before the JavaScript file executed 'cmd /c ipconfig' is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline. However, since the 'cmd /c ipconfig' command is part of the Execution phase, it is likely that the Initial Access, Execution, and Defense Evasion tactics occurred before it. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question based on the provided information.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined with the given information.
