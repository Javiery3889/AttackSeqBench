 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the CTI outline and the question, and then match them to find the tactic that most likely occurred after the Konni APT Group delivered an ISO file containing malicious scripts.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access (Delivering an ISO file containing malicious scripts)
2. Defense Evasion (Obfuscation of scripts and indicator removal)
3. Discovery (Gathering information about the user's computer)
4. Collection (Preparing information for exfiltration)
5. Command and Control (Communication with C2 server)
6. Exfiltration (Sending data to C2 server)

The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after Initial Access (delivering an ISO file containing malicious scripts) and before Persistence (using 'stopedge.bat' to schedule tasks).

From the sequence above, the tactic that fits this description is Discovery (Gathering information about the user's computer), as it is the tactic that occurs after Initial Access and before Persistence.

Final Answer: Discovery.
