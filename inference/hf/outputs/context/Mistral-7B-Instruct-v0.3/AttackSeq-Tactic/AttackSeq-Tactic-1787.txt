 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the Elise malware gained persistence via the use of the Run Registry key and injected hidden DLLs into iexplore.exe to prevent analysis.

From the CTI outline, we know that the malware creates a mutex, stores harvested data, and sends data to the C2 server after gaining persistence. It also communicates with the C2 server, sending and receiving files and commands.

The tactic that most closely aligns with these actions is "Command and Control" (T1071). This tactic involves the malware communicating with a remote server to receive instructions, send data, or both. The malware in this case is doing exactly that, as it communicates with the hardcoded C2 server (103.236.150[.]14) to send harvested data and receive files and commands.

Final Answer: T1071 - Command and Control.
