 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events after the exfiltration of AWS credentials to the C2 servers. The question mentions that over 40% of attacks involved backdoors, indicating further exploitation.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the tactics related to backdoors are Defense Evasion (to avoid detection) and Persistence (to maintain access). However, Persistence tactics are typically used before further exploitation to ensure continued access to the compromised system. On the other hand, Defense Evasion is used to evade detection after initial access and before further exploitation.

Therefore, the most likely tactic that occurred after the exfiltration of AWS credentials and the observation of backdoors is Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion.
