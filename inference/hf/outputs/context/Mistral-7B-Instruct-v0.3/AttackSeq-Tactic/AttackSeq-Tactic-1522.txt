 To answer this question, we need to identify the tactic that Whitefly would likely use after they have already performed lateral movement across the network using stolen credentials. The tactic that follows the lateral movement is the one that Whitefly would use to gather and exfiltrate data from the compromised network.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the tactic of Exfiltration is the most likely choice after Whitefly has expanded their control within the organization. The Exfiltration tactic involves the removal of data from the compromised system, which is the next logical step after Whitefly has gained access to the desired data through lateral movement.

Final Answer: C: Exfiltration.
