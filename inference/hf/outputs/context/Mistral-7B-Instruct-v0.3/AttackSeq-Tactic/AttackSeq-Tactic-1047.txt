 Final Answer: B: Execution

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: ProjectM actors used spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks to deliver malicious payloads.
   - Resource Development: ProjectM actors developed a toolset, including Trojans and RATs.
   - Execution: ProjectM actors executed malicious code through the use of Trojans and RATs.
   - Defense Evasion: ProjectM actors used WHOIS protection services and various Trojans/RATs for defense evasion.
   - Command and Control: ProjectM actors used domains for C2 servers to deliver further payloads.
   - Others: ProjectM actors executed malicious code after delivering payloads, as indicated by the exploitation of vulnerabilities and the use of malicious macros.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after ProjectM actors utilized spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks to deliver malicious payloads.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Execution (B) is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the ProjectM actors delivered malicious payloads, as it involves the execution of the malicious code contained within those payloads.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: B: Execution. The ProjectM actors executed malicious code through the use of Trojans and RATs after delivering payloads via spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
