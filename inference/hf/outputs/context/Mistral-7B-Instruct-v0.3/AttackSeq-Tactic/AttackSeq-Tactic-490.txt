 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access -> Execution -> Persistence -> Defense Evasion -> Discovery -> Command and Control -> Exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the Discovery phase, where the backdoor collected system information, and then asks about the next likely tactic after that.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The Discovery phase is followed by Command and Control in the attack sequence from the CTI outline. The backdoor's capability to communicate with C2 servers, send machine information, receive commands, and upload data such as screenshots aligns with the Command and Control tactic.

4. The other answer choices do not align with the sequence or the context provided in the CTI outline. Resource Development (C) is not relevant to the sequence, and Collection (B) has already been mentioned in the Discovery phase. Arbitrary commands (mentioned in the Question) are a part of the Command and Control tactic, as the backdoor is capable of executing them.
