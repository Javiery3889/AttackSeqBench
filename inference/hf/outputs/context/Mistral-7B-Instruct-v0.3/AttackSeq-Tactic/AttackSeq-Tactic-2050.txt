 Final Answer: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker gains access to the system through a poisoned pawn (malware).
   - Execution: The malware, XAgent, runs in the background on iOS 7 devices and exhibits diminished functionality on iOS 8.
   - Command and Control: The malware sends collected data (geo-location and text messages) out via HTTP POST requests to the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the data was sent out via HTTP POST requests.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware collects data and sends it out via HTTP POST requests. The Command and Control tactic involves the establishment of a communication channel for the exfiltration of data. Since the data collection and exfiltration are part of the Command and Control tactic, it is most likely that this tactic occurred before the data was sent out.

4. Discovery and Credential Access are not directly related to the data exfiltration process. Privilege Escalation is not mentioned in the CTI outline, so it can be ruled out. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Initial Access -> Execution -> Command and Control.
