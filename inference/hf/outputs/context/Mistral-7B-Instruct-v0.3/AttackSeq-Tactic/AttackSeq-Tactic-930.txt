 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that occurs after the decryption of obfuscated registry content and the deployment of the njRAT remote access tool.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the fifth stage involves the decryption of the obfuscated registry content and the execution of a PowerShell script leading to njRAT. The sixth stage is not explicitly mentioned in the outline, but we can infer that it would be the execution of the remote access tool (njRAT) on the victim's computer.

The MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurs after the deployment of the remote access tool is Command and Control (T1071). This tactic involves the establishment of a connection between the attacker and the compromised system, which is exactly what happens when the attacker gains control of the victim's computer through njRAT.

Final Answer: B: Command and Control
