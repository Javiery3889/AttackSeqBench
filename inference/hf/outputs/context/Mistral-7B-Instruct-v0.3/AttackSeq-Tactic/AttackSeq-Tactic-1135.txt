 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline and find the tactic that most likely occurred before Defense Evasion.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access (through a supply chain attack)
2. Defense Evasion (manual loading of a DLL using native Ntdll.dll functions)

The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before Defense Evasion. Since the sequence in the CTI outline shows that Initial Access occurred before Defense Evasion, the answer is:

Final Answer: Initial Access.
