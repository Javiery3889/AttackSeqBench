 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics presented in the CTI outline and match them with the TTPs mentioned in the question.

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails and strategic Web compromises
2. Execution: Delivery and execution of Poison Ivy server
3. Persistence: Enabling persistence in Poison Ivy
4. Defense Evasion: Encrypting Poison Ivy's network communications
5. Others: Discovery, Command and Control, and other related activities (not directly mentioned in the question)

The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after Poison Ivy's network communications were encrypted using the Camellia cipher and blended with normal SSL traffic on port 443.

From the sequence of tactics, we can see that Defense Evasion (encrypting network communications) occurred before Command and Control (establishing a connection between the Poison Ivy server and the attacker's client). Therefore, it is unlikely that Command and Control occurred after Defense Evasion.

The remaining options are Discovery and Persistence. Since Defense Evasion is a technique used to hide malicious activity, it is more likely that the attackers would establish persistence (Persistence tactic) on the compromised system before moving on to other discovery activities (Discovery tactic).

Final Answer: Persistence.
