 Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email with malicious document
   - Execution: VBScript executed using 'wscript.exe'
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscation techniques within the VBS script, self-deletion
   - Command and Control: Communication with C&C server

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurred between the execution of the VBScript and the communication with the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the VBScript was executed and then obfuscated and self-deleted to evade detection, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Reconnaissance does not seem to be applicable in this context as there is no evidence of information gathering before the VBScript execution.
   - Persistence is not relevant as the VBS script does not establish a long-term presence on the compromised system.
   - Execution has already occurred, as stated in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is: Execution (VBS executed using 'wscript.exe') -> Defense Evasion (obfuscation and self-deletion) -> Command and Control (communication with C&C server). The tactic that most likely occurred between the execution and the communication with the C&C server is Defense Evasion.
