 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that occurs between the execution of the Bankshot implant and the wiping of files and content for defense evasion.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Bankshot implant is executed by downloading and running the DLL implant from a malicious domain (Execution). After that, the implant is designed to evade detection and persist on a victim's network for further exploitation, which includes wiping files and content from the targeted system (Defense Evasion).

Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred between these two events is Persistence, as the implant would need to establish a foothold on the system and ensure its continued presence before it can perform destructive actions like wiping files.

Final Answer: D: Persistence
