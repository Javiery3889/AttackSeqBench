 To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - Initial Access: Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app.
   - Execution: The malware downloader executed two binaries, including a reconnaissance tool and a RAT.
   - Persistence: The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.
   - Discovery: The reconnaissance tool performed discovery after being executed.
   - Command and Control: The RAT communicated with a C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after Tortoiseshell maintained persistence on the victim's system using the RAT named 'IvizTech' and before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic that most likely occurred after persistence and before discovery is Command and Control, as the RAT communicated with a C2 server after being installed and before the reconnaissance tool collected information. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred between these two events, so we need to look for another tactic that could happen after persistence and before discovery.
   - The only remaining tactic is Discovery, as it is the tactic that occurs after the execution of the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe'. Since the RAT was installed and executed before 'bird.exe', Discovery is the tactic that most likely occurred after persistence and before the reconnaissance tool collected detailed information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Reasoning: The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system. After the RAT was installed, it could have performed various actions, but the CTI outline does not specify any actions related to Credential Access, Impact, or Defense Evasion. The next event in the sequence is the execution of the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe', which performs Discovery. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after Tortoiseshell maintained persistence on the victim's system using the RAT named 'IvizTech' and before the reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine is Discovery.
   - Final Answer: B: Discovery.
