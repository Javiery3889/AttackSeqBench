 Final Answer: B: Defense Evasion

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, Impact.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after the PowerShell script avoided detection by operating in memory and leveraged the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the PowerShell script's defense evasion techniques are described, including operating in memory and using the DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving them to disk. The Impact tactic follows Defense Evasion in the sequence.
   - The Execution tactic is the one where the PowerShell script is executed, which is before Defense Evasion in the sequence. Credential Access and Command and Control are not directly related to the PowerShell script's behavior as described in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PowerShell script's defense evasion techniques were employed after it was executed (Execution tactic). The tactic that most likely occurred after these defense evasion techniques was the Impact tactic, where the downloaded and executed payloads (GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware) affected the compromised system. However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the PowerShell script's specific defense evasion techniques, so the answer is B: Defense Evasion.
