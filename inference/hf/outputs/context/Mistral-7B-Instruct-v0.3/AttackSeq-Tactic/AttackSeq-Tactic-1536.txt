 Final Answer: D: Discovery

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance -> Initial Access -> Execution -> Persistence -> Privilege Escalation -> Defense Evasion -> Discovery -> Lateral Movement -> Collection -> Command and Control -> Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the use of Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and compromise additional endpoints.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Discovery tactic involves using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints. This aligns with the details in the question.
   - The other answer choices do not directly involve the use of Cobalt Strike beacon for discovery or compromising additional endpoints.

4. Conclusion:
   - The Discovery tactic most likely preceded the lateral movement efforts to compromise numerous workstations in search of critical information.
