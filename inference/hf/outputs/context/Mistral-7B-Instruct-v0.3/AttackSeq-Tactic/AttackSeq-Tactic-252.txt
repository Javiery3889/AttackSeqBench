 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events that would lead to unauthorized access manipulating or tampering with the MSSQL database integrity.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Inner-Loader component of the skip-2.0 backdoor first identifies the process running MSSQL Server (Discovery). After discovering the MSSQL Server process, the next logical step would be to execute an action against it, which in this case is unauthorized access and manipulation of the MSSQL database integrity (Impact).

So, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred next would be Impact.

Final Answer: Impact.
