 Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Cobalt Strike's beacon is used for initial compromise and establishment of a foothold.
   - Privilege Escalation: Attackers escalate privileges to obtain administrator credentials for lateral movement.
   - Defense Evasion: Cobalt Strike provides techniques to bypass detection, but it does not directly involve propagating beacons to other systems.
   - Discovery: Attackers collect information about the network after gaining escalated privileges, but it does not directly involve propagating beacons.
   - Others: The report does not mention any specific tactic related to propagating beacons.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - After gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning, the question asks about the most likely tactic that occurred next when attackers propagated beacons to other systems within the company's network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after gathering network information (Discovery), attackers escalate privileges (Privilege Escalation) and then propagate beacons (Lateral Movement).
   - The question does not mention Defense Evasion or Execution, which are not related to propagating beacons.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning (Discovery), the most likely tactic that occurred next when attackers propagated beacons to other systems within the company's network is Lateral Movement.
