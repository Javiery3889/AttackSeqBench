 Final Answer: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access (Phishing)
     - Credential Access (Credentials collected through the phishing sites)
     - Defense Evasion (Not explicitly mentioned, but the use of fictitious login sites could be considered an attempt to evade detection)
     - Command and Control (The attackers used a Command and Control server hosted on com-login.mobi to redirect users to a YouTube clip)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the credentials were collected and users were redirected to a YouTube clip.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Command and Control is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the credentials were collected and users were redirected to a YouTube clip, as the attackers used a Command and Control server to manage the redirection process.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the Command and Control tactic was used after the credentials were collected.
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the credentials were collected and users were redirected to a YouTube clip.
   - The tactic of Command and Control is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the credentials were collected and users were redirected to a YouTube clip, as the attackers used a Command and Control server to manage the redirection process.
   - Final Answer: Command and Control.
