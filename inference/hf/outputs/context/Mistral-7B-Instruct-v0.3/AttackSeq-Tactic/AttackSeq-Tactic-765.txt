 Final Answer: B: Reconnaissance

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Darkhotel APT's targeting of top executives during their stay at certain hotels suggests that they have detailed knowledge of their victims' travel plans. This implies that they have conducted reconnaissance to gather this information.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic most likely involved in obtaining knowledge of victims' whereabouts, such as names and places of stay.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline does not directly state that the Darkhotel APT used a specific tactic to gather this information, but the context provided suggests that they conducted reconnaissance to learn about their victims' travel plans. The other tactics listed (Resource Development, Initial Access, Command and Control) do not involve gathering such information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning: The Darkhotel APT's ability to target top executives during their stay at certain hotels indicates that they have detailed knowledge of their victims' travel plans. This suggests that they have conducted reconnaissance to gather this information, as it would be difficult to predict travel plans without some form of prior intelligence gathering. Therefore, the most likely tactic involved in obtaining this information is Reconnaissance.
