 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after the CTU analysts sinkholed the 'Tawnya Grilth' domains and redirected infected traffic to servers for logging connections and gathering statistics.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the sinkholing and traffic redirection were part of the Discovery tactic (T1083). After discovering the infected systems, the next logical step would be to maintain command and control over these systems to further investigate and potentially execute malware.

So, the most likely tactic that occurred after the sinkholing of 'Tawnya Grilth' domains is Command and Control (T1057).

Final Answer: C: Command and Control.
