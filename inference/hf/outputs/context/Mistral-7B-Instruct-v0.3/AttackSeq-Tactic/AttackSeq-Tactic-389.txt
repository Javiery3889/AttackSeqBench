 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: The threat actors acquired domain names and rented servers. They compromised websites to inject JavaScript code that would load additional malicious code from their command and control (C&C) servers.
   - Initial Access: Visitors to the compromised websites were potentially exposed to exploits, and the threat actors engaged in spearphishing campaigns.
   - Execution: The malicious Word documents contained VBA macros that executed code using the Document_Open function.
   - Others: The campaign targeted high-profile organizations, involved strategic web compromises, and the scripts from the watering hole attacks communicated with external servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the scripts from the watering hole attacks began communicating with external servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The scripts from the watering hole attacks (compromised websites) communicated with external servers (C&C servers), which is a tactic described under the Command and Control (C2) category in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The scripts from the watering hole attacks (compromised websites) were designed to load additional malicious code from the threat actors' command and control (C&C) servers. This communication between the scripts and the C&C servers is a tactic under the Command and Control (C2) category in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Therefore, the most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the scripts began communicating with external servers is Command and Control (C).
