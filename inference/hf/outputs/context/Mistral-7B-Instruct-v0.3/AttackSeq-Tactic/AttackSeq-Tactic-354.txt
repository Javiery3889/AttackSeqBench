 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Stolen credentials and SSH tools
   - Execution: Malicious code execution using PowerShell loaders and scripts for 64-bit backdoor, and a custom VM-based payload loader for 32-bit backdoor
   - Discovery: SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process, system information, system time discovery, and network service scanning
   - Collection: Data archiving using a custom storage file format
   - Command and Control: C2 communication using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, SSL-encrypted traffic, and bypassing proxies
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration over the C2 channel

The tactic we are looking for is between the execution of the custom VM-based payload and the network service scanning (Discovery).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign utilized encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute their custom VM-based payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic that best fits this description is Execution, as it involves the execution of the custom VM-based payload, which is the event immediately preceding the Discovery tactic in the CTI outline. However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred after this event, so we need to look for a tactic that follows Execution.
   - The Discovery tactic is the next logical step after Execution, as the attackers would need to gather information about the compromised system before moving laterally or performing other actions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign executed their custom VM-based payload using PowerShell loaders and scripts. This event falls under the Execution tactic.
   - The next logical step for the attackers would be to gather information about the compromised system, which is the Discovery tactic.
   - Therefore, the Discovery tactic most likely occurred after the CostaRicto Campaign utilized encrypted PowerShell loaders and scripts to execute their custom VM-based payload and before the attackers used tools like pscan and nmap for network service scanning.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
