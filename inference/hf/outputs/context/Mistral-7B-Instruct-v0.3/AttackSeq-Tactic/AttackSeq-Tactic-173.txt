 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline and then find the tactic that most likely occurred before the installation of the hidden 'autoupdater' module.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access (achieved through a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application)
2. Defense Evasion (using a legitimate-looking application and website, encryption, mimicking legitimate network traffic)
3. Command and Control (communication with a command and control server)
4. Persistence (installation of a hidden 'autoupdater' module)

The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before the installation of the hidden 'autoupdater' module. Given the sequence of tactics in the CTI outline, the tactic that logically precedes Persistence is Initial Access.

Final Answer: Initial Access.
