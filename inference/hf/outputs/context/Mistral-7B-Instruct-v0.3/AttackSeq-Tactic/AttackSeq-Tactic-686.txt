 Final Answer: B: Lateral Movement

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - Initial Access: Automatic and manual vulnerability discovery, control of a server, further penetration of the internal network.
   - Execution: Exploitation of a vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server, execution of the Explosive Trojan.
   - Persistence: Installation of the Explosive Trojan with various service names and paths, use of other files and directories for tasks.
   - Defense Evasion: Hiding from detection tools, changing versions and builds, detaching suspicious API activities, setting custom configurations.
   - Credential Access: Keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - Lateral Movement: Manual and automated spreading to the entire network using the Explosive Trojan.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after the attackers used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers initially gained access to a server, executed the Explosive Trojan, and then used the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network using the Explosive Trojan.
   - The tactic that most likely occurred after this sequence is Lateral Movement, as it describes the spreading of the attack across the network.

4. The answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence and any critical contextual information is B: Lateral Movement.
