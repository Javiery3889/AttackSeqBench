 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT15 gained access to the network.
   - Execution: APT15 deployed backdoors, including RoyalDNS.
   - Defense Evasion: APT15 used RoyalCLI to evade policy settings.
   - Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - Collection: APT15 collected data using various tools.
   - Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator privileges.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic that most likely occurred after deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor is Persistence, as the backdoor was designed to install persistently on the victim's network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The reasoning is that once the RoyalDNS backdoor is installed, it persists on the network, allowing APT15 to maintain access and control over the compromised hosts. This is consistent with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Persistence.
   - Final Answer: A: Persistence.
