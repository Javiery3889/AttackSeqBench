 Final Answer: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access -> Discovery -> Execution -> Defense Evasion -> Impact.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the discovery phase where cybercriminals explored financial systems using compromised system administrator credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Discovery phase is the third step in the attack sequence. To find the tactic that most likely occurred before the Discovery phase, we need to look at the previous step, which is Initial Access.

4. Final Answer:
   - The Initial Access tactic most likely occurred before the Discovery phase, as it is the previous step in the attack sequence.
