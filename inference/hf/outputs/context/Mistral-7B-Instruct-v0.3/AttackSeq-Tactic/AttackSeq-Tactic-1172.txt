 To answer this question, we need to identify the tactics mentioned in the question and find their sequence in the CTI outline.

1. The question mentions the use of backdoor malware to execute remote commands (Command and Control).
2. The CTI outline mentions the deployment of Hermes ransomware after the Lazarus group executed remote commands with the backdoor malware (Impact).

Now, let's look for a tactic that occurs between these two events.

In the CTI outline, we can see that the Lazarus group employed defense evasion tactics before using the backdoor malware (Defense Evasion). However, defense evasion is not directly related to the deployment of Hermes ransomware.

Therefore, there is no tactic mentioned in the CTI outline that occurs after the use of backdoor malware and before the deployment of Hermes ransomware. This means that the question does not have a direct answer based on the provided CTI outline.

However, if we consider the context of the attack, it is reasonable to assume that the Lazarus group might have performed lateral movement within the FEIB network to spread the malware and prepare for the deployment of Hermes ransomware. But this is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline, so it remains speculative.

Final Answer: The question does not have a direct answer based on the provided CTI outline. However, it is speculative that the Lazarus group might have performed Lateral Movement to prepare for the deployment of Hermes ransomware.
