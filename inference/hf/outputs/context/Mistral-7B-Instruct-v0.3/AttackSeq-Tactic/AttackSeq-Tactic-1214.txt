 To answer this question, we need to identify the tactic that would provide the attackers with the necessary access to execute commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer on the compromised system. These commands are used for computer profiling and gathering information about the network.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attackers first gained Initial Access to the system using the SocGholish framework, which was delivered via compromised legitimate websites. After that, they executed a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, which downloaded additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts. This sequence of events suggests that the attackers used Discovery tactics to profile the computer and gather information before executing commands like whoami, net user, and Get-NetComputer.

Final Answer: D: Discovery.
