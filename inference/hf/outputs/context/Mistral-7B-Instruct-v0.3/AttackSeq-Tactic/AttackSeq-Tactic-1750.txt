 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that would most likely occur before the execution of the malware, which is when the victim is enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a widely-used cloud provider.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Initial Access tactic is not directly related to the link to a file hosted on a cloud provider. The Discovery tactic is more about the threat actor gathering information about the target, which doesn't seem to be the case here as the victim is already infected. The Persistence tactic occurs after the malware has been executed and is trying to maintain its presence on the system.

The Execution tactic, however, is the most plausible as it involves the malware being executed, which is what happens when the victim opens the decoy business files.

Final Answer: B: Execution.
