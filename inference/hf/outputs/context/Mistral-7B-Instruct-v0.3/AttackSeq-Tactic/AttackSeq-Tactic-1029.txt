 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing email exploiting CVE-2015-2545 in Microsoft Word.
   - Execution: TidePool malware allows reading, writing, deleting files, running commands, and sending information to C2 server via HTTP.
   - Persistence: TidePool uses an ActiveSetup key in the Windows Registry to ensure launch on boot.
   - Defense Evasion: Modifying the registry setting 'Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\IEHarden' to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the next tactic after TidePool achieved persistence and began communicating with its domain 'goback.strangled[.]net'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that TidePool achieves persistence and then communicates with its C2 server via HTTP. The question asks about the tactic that occurred next, which is the communication with the C2 server.

4. The answer choices do not directly match the sequence in the CTI outline, but we can infer that the malware communicates with its C2 server as part of the Command and Control tactic. Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: Command and Control.
