 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline that lead to the redirection of victims' future incoming emails to an actor-controlled address.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the redirection of emails is part of the "Collection" tactic. However, to understand the sequence of events that led to this, we need to trace back the steps:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target.
2. Initial Access: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system.
3. Defense Evasion: Using obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.
4. Credential Access: Accessing credentials to gain higher privileges.
5. Discovery: Gathering system and network information.
6. Collection: Redirecting emails to an actor-controlled address.
7. Command and Control: Communicating with the compromised systems.
8. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data from the compromised system.

Given this sequence, the tactic that most likely occurred before the redirection of emails is "Initial Access", as it is the first step in the sequence that leads to the collection of emails.

Final Answer: Initial Access.
