 Final Answer: A: Command and Control

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
   - Reconnaissance
   - Initial Access (Deliver Remote Access Trojan)
   - Execution (Install BlackEnergy 3)
   - Command and Control (Not explicitly mentioned in the outline, but it is the logical next step after the malware is installed)
   - Credential Access
   - Discovery (Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network, Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network)
   - Impact

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the TTP that facilitated communication between the malware and an external server.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is "Command and Control". This TTP is the most likely next step after the malware is installed (Execution), as it enables the adversaries to control the malware and communicate with it.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning:
   - After the employees enable macros for the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware, the malware is installed on their workstations.
   - The next logical step would be for the adversaries to establish communication with the malware, which is facilitated by the Command and Control TTP.
   - This communication allows the adversaries to issue commands to the malware, such as downloading additional malicious components, gathering information, or executing further attacks.

Therefore, the answer is A: Command and Control.
