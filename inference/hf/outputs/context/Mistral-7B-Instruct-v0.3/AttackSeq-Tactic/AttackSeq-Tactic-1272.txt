 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that could lead to the use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk.

From the CTI outline, we can see that TG1021 performed the following TTPs:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Lateral Movement
9. Command and Control

The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit for scanning and mapping targets without leaving binary traces on disk is more likely to occur after Initial Access, Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Defense Evasion, as these TTPs would provide the necessary access, execution environment, elevated privileges, and stealth for these tools to operate effectively.

However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred before these actions. Since SharpHound and PowerSploit are used for Discovery (mapping targets), it is plausible that Discovery (Tactic B) occurred before these actions. This is because Discovery is a prerequisite for later actions like Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control.

Final Answer: B: Discovery
