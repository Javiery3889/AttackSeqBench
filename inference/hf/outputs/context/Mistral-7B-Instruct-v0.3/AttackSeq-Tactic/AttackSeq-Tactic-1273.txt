 To answer this question, we need to compare the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question with the attack sequence identified in the CTI outline.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Discovery phase occurred before the Command and Control phase. In the Discovery phase, TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.

Comparing this with the answer choices, the tactic that most likely occurred before the Command and Control phase is "Discovery".

Final Answer: A: Discovery.
