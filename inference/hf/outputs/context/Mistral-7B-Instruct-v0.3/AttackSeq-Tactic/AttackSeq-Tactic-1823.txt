 Final Answer: Execution

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: Defense Evasion, Execution, Persistence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks for the tactic that occurs between Defense Evasion and Persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic that occurs between Defense Evasion and Persistence is Execution, as the malware's payload (which has been evaded from defenses) needs to be executed before it can maintain persistence.

4. The answer choice that aligns best with the attack sequence and any critical contextual information is "Execution".
