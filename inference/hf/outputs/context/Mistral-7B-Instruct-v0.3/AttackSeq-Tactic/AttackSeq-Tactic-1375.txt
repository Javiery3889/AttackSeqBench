 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline and the question, and then compare them to find the most likely tactic that occurred before FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the sequence of TTPs is as follows:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Collection
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

The question mentions the use of WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations, which is part of the "Lateral Movement" tactic according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Comparing the sequence of TTPs from the CTI outline with the "Lateral Movement" tactic, we can see that "Lateral Movement" is not directly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that "Discovery" (gathering information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services) and "Collection" (collecting data from network shared drives) are likely part of the reconnaissance phase. After that, FIN13 would need to establish a foothold (Initial Access), execute commands (Execution), and persist within the network (Persistence). Then, they would likely escalate privileges (Privilege Escalation) and evade detection (Defense Evasion) before moving laterally (Lateral Movement).

So, the most likely tactic that occurred before FIN13 used WMI and custom web shells for cross-platform operations is "Privilege Escalation".

Final Answer: Privilege Escalation.
