 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics in the CTI outline and find the tactic that most likely occurred after the delivery of embedded malware and before the automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers.

From the CTI outline, the sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access (Delivery of embedded malware in a proprietary hardware/software scanner application)
2. Execution (Malware execution upon connection to the wireless network)
3. Command and Control (Establishment of command and control connections)
4. Discovery (Automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers)
5. Persistence (Malware persistence in the Windows XP embedded version)
6. Exfiltration (Exfiltration of financial and ERP data)

Comparing this sequence with the question, we can see that the automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers (Discovery) occurred after the Initial Access (delivery of embedded malware) and before the Exfiltration. Therefore, the tactic that most likely occurred after the delivery of embedded malware and before the automated attack using the SMB protocol targeted servers is Initial Access (C: Initial Access).

Final Answer: C: Initial Access.
