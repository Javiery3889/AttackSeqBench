 To answer this question, we need to identify the sequence of TTPs that occurred after the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 and before the use of defense evasion techniques (T1107 and T1045).

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access was achieved through spearphishing (T1193), and the attacker used a Microsoft Office exploit (implied by the mention of CVE-2017-11882). After initial access, the attacker executed the malware (T1059.001 - Command Line Interface), which is not mentioned in the question. However, the next step was the collection of data from the local system (T1005 - Data from Local System), which occurred before the defense evasion techniques.

So, the TTP that most likely occurred after the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 and before they employed techniques such as T1107 (File Deletion) and T1045 (Software Packing) for stealth is:

Final Answer: Data Collection (T1005 - Data from Local System)
