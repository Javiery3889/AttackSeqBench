 Final Answer: C: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Attackers used various methods to gain access, but this is not directly related to the question.
   - Execution: The Scote malware provides backdoor access and collects C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles.
   - Defense Evasion: Scote malware employs techniques to evade detection, but this is not directly related to the question.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that occurs after Scote malware evades detection and retrieves information to establish communications with its servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the Scote malware collects C2 information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles, which is the action of establishing communications with its servers.
   - The answer choices are: A: Defense Evasion (already addressed and not related), B: Reconnaissance (not directly related to the action of establishing communications), C: Command and Control (directly related to the action of establishing communications), D: Exfiltration (not directly related to the action of establishing communications).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After Scote malware uses multiple techniques to evade detection, it collects command and control (C2) information from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles to establish communications with its servers. This aligns with the tactic of Command and Control (C). Therefore, the final answer is C: Command and Control.
