 Final Answer: B: Credential Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Lazarus breaches targeted banks' networks to gain initial access.
   - Execution: Lazarus deploys Trojan.Fastcash to execute fraudulent ATM transactions.
   - Credential Access: Lazarus uses real account numbers (PANs) to carry out FASTCash attacks.
   - Others: Lazarus manipulates banking application servers to approve fraudulent withdrawals.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that occurred when Lazarus manipulated banking application servers to result in the loss of money through ATM withdrawals.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Lazarus uses real account numbers (PANs) to carry out FASTCash attacks, and they manipulate banking application servers to approve fraudulent withdrawals. This aligns best with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic "Credential Access," as it involves the theft and abuse of credentials to gain unauthorized access to resources.

4. The other answer choices do not align as well with the provided information:
   - Defense Evasion is not relevant as there is no indication that Lazarus was trying to hide their presence or actions within the system.
   - Exfiltration is not relevant as there is no evidence that Lazarus exfiltrated data from the banks' networks during the FASTCash attacks.
   - Impact is not relevant as it refers to the effect of an attack, while the question asks about the tactic used to achieve the impact.
