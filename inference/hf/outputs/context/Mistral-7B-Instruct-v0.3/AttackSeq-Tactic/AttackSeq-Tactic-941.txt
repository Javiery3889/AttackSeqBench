 To answer this question, we need to identify the MITRE ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking through the benign file sidebar.exe to evade antivirus detection.

From the CTI outline, we know that after DLL hijacking, the malicious loader injected a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. This action is part of the Defense Evasion tactic (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1086).

The next step was the execution of the backdoor, which was launched by the malicious loader. This is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1055). However, the question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the DLL hijacking, so we should focus on the Defense Evasion tactic.

Final Answer: C: Defense Evasion. This is the tactic that most likely occurred after Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking through the benign file sidebar.exe to evade antivirus detection.
