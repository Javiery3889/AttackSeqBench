 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The group gains initial access by exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in services like Citrix, Pulse Secure, or Zimbra.
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before the group deployed tools or obtained legitimate credentials to maintain long-term access to the compromised system.
3. Compare and Evaluate: The Initial Access tactic is the first step in the attack sequence, where the attacker gains access to the system. After gaining initial access, the attacker would then deploy tools or obtain legitimate credentials, which could be considered Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Exfiltration. However, since the question asks for the tactic that occurred before these actions, the most plausible answer is the Initial Access tactic.
