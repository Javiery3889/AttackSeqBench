 Final Answer: B: Command and Control

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Naikon APT group initially accessed the target systems using spear-phishing documents with CVE-2012-0158 exploits. The Hellsing APT group then retaliated by sending a backdoor to the Naikon attackers, which connected to a command server at philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the Hellsing APT group's backdoor connected to its server to carry out actions like uploading and downloading files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The tactic that best aligns with the backdoor connecting to the command server and performing actions like uploading and downloading files is the Command and Control (C2) tactic. This tactic involves establishing a covert channel to an external system to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. The other tactics mentioned in the CTI outline (Initial Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement) do not directly involve the connection of a backdoor to a command server for file transfer activities.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Command and Control.
