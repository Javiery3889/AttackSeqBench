 Final Answer: C: Resource Development

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files.
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through Trojans and RATs.
   - Defense Evasion: Infrastructure concealment using WHOIS protection services.
   - Resource Development: Development of a significant toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the tactic that most likely occurred after the ProjectM campaign concealed infrastructure using WHOIS protection services and linked domains for delivery of additional payloads like Andromeda.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The tactic of Resource Development is the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the concealment of infrastructure, as it involves the development of tools and payloads like Andromeda.

4. Defense Evasion is not the most likely tactic because it focuses on concealing infrastructure, while the question asks about the tactic that occurred after the concealment.
5. Impact is not the most likely tactic because it refers to the effects of an attack, such as data destruction or exfiltration, and the question asks about the tactic that occurred after the concealment of infrastructure.
6. Command and Control is not the most likely tactic because it refers to the communication between the attacker and compromised systems, and the question asks about the tactic that occurred after the concealment of infrastructure.
