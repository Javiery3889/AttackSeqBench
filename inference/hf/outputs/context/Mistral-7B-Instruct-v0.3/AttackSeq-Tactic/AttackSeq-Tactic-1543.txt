 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Inception Framework utilized initial access techniques by exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) to gain remote access to victims' computers. This is the initial step in the attack, as it allows the attackers to access the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred after the Inception Framework exploited vulnerabilities in RTF files.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The tactic of Initial Access is the first step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which is the tactic that occurred when the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities in RTF files. The other tactics mentioned in the answer choices (Defense Evasion, Persistence, Command and Control) are tactics that occur after Initial Access.

Therefore, the most likely answer is C: Initial Access.
