 Final Answer: C: Execution

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attack started with Initial Access using a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment.
2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions the execution of scripts and batch files before ensuring persistence through registry modifications.
3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, after the Initial Access, the attack involved the execution of the malicious PDF file, which was actually an executable. This execution likely involved the running of scripts and batch files to prepare the attack environment. Then, the attack persisted through registry modifications. Therefore, the tactic that most likely involved the execution of scripts and batch files is the Execution tactic.
