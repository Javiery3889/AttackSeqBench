 Final Answer: C: Initial Access

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The MuddyWater campaign initially gains access through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros (Initial Access).
2. Analyze the Question: The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred before PowerShell scripts were executed to decode and run embedded backdoor components.
3. Compare and Evaluate: In the CTI outline, the initial access is achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document with embedded macros. This action leads to the execution of PowerShell scripts, which then decode and run the embedded backdoor components. Therefore, the Initial Access tactic is the most likely preceding event to the execution of PowerShell scripts.

The other answer choices do not directly relate to the sequence of events in the CTI outline:
- Reconnaissance (B) is not mentioned in the CTI outline as a tactic that occurred before the PowerShell scripts were executed.
- Execution (A) is the tactic that occurs after the PowerShell scripts are executed, as they are responsible for decoding and running the embedded backdoor components.
- Lateral Movement (D) is not mentioned in the CTI outline as a tactic that occurred before the PowerShell scripts were executed.
