 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.
   - Discovery: The Rising Sun implant exfiltrated the collected data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
   - No mention of blogs or WordPress for bidirectional communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant communicated with the C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data to the control server via HTTP POST requests, but there is no mention of it using blogs or WordPress for bidirectional communication.

4. Conclusion:
   - The Rising Sun implant did not communicate with the C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
