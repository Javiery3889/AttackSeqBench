 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Turla uses PowerShell to run malware in memory.
   - Persistence: Turla uses WMI and PowerShell profile for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Turla encrypts payloads, obfuscates scripts, and uses an AMSI bypass technique.
   - Discovery: Turla uses RPC backdoor and PowerStallion for lateral movement and control. They collect files and monitor USB drives.
   - Collection: Turla's RPC backdoor plugins collect files, and PowerStallion uses OneDrive for command and control.
   - Command and Control: RPC backdoor uses RPC, while PowerStallion uses OneDrive.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the method PowerStallion uses for exfiltrating collected data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control server, not HTTPS.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - PowerStallion does not exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS. Instead, it uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control server. (Final Answer: B: No)
