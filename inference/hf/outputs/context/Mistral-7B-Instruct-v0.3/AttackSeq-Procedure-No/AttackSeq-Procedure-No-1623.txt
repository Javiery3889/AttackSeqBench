 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The attackers first conducted reconnaissance, targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE. They then used spear-phishing to distribute malicious Microsoft Office documents, which led to initial access.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if the attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the attackers first conducted reconnaissance, which aligns with the question's requirement of targeting specific domains. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains.

4. The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence and the contextual information provided in the CTI outline.
