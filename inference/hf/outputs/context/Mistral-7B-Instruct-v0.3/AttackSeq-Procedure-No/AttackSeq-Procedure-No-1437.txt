 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: SSH, RDP, VPN, Chrome passwords
   - Persistence: Credential hopping, Delegated Administrator rights, TrailBlazer malware, GoldMax malware, O365 Service Principals
   - Defense Evasion: Stealing browser cookies, renamed utilities, system renaming
   - Credential Access: Web session cookies, RDP, compromised service principals, Information Repositories
   - Discovery: AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, tasklist.exe, external services probing
   - Lateral Movement: RDP (both privileged and non-privileged accounts)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the discovery activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the threat actor used RDP for lateral movement before accessing data from Information Repositories.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The threat actor used RDP for lateral movement (Lateral Movement TTP) before accessing data from Information Repositories (Discovery TTP). Therefore, it is likely that they used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment even before accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
