 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
   - Execution: T9000 sideloaded a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, and used igfxtray.exe.
   - Persistence: T9000 established persistence through registry keys modification and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - Defense Evasion: T9000 evaded detection by customizing its installation and using a multi-stage process.
   - Command and Control: T9000 communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
   - Exfiltration: T9000 exfiltrated various types of data, including Skype communications.
   - Others: T9000 was observed modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll for persistence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that T9000 indeed established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.

4. Final Answer:
   - Based on the CTI outline and the question, the most plausible answer is "Yes". T9000 is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution.
