 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Elfin is scanning for vulnerable websites and creating C&C infrastructure.
   - Initial Access: Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) to gain initial access.
   - Execution: Elfin deploys various malware, including Pupy RAT and Quasar RAT.
   - Persistence: Elfin creates a scheduled task to maintain persistence on compromised systems.
   - Defense Evasion: Elfin uses PowerShell commands and other tools to bypass logging and evade detection.
   - Credential Access: Elfin deploys DarkComet, which includes a credential dumping tool.
   - Command and Control: Elfin uses POSHC2, Quasar RAT, and other tools to communicate with and control compromised systems.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Elfin established command and control using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT after exfiltrating data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Elfin uses POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for command and control. Since the question asks if it is likely that Elfin established command and control using these tools after exfiltrating data, the answer is yes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After Elfin exfiltrated data using a custom .NET FTP tool and FastUploader, it is likely that they established command and control using POSHC2 and other tools like Quasar RAT, as they have been observed using these tools for command and control in the past.
