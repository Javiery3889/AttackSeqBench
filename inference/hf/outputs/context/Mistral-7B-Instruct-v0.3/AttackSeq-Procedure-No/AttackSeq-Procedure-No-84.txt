 To answer this question, we need to find the sequence of TTPs related to file exfiltration and compression with zlib. From the CTI outline, we can see that Vyveva compresses files with zlib before sending them to the C&C server during the Collection tactic (T1560.002). However, there is no information in the CTI outline that suggests Vyveva divides files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic (T1041). Therefore, it is not likely that Vyveva will divide files based on the given size as part of the Exfiltration tactic.

Final Answer: B: No.
