 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The attackers collected information on their targets prior to phishing attacks.
   - Initial Access: The attackers used phishing attacks through email or social media accounts and compromised accounts of public figures to send fake security alerts and create fake Google Drive download pages.
   - Persistence: In some cases, the hackers did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.
   - Defense Evasion: The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems and used third-party services to host these images. They also used a hidden tracking image in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.
   - Others: The campaign's phishing infrastructure included over 20 domain names set up between September and November 2018. The attackers used VPNs and proxies with Dutch and French IP addresses but were traced back to real Iranian IP addresses during the preparation phase. The campaign's timing, methods, and targets suggest it is linked to the Charming Kitten group.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Charming Kitten group will utilize phishing attempts to gain initial access with tactics such as using fake security alerts to steal credentials only afterward.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Charming Kitten group used phishing attacks to gain initial access (Initial Access tactic) and sent fake security alerts to steal credentials (Defense Evasion tactic). The question asks if they will use phishing attempts to gain initial access and steal credentials afterward, which aligns with the tactics used by the Charming Kitten group in this attack.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Charming Kitten group used phishing attacks to gain initial access by sending fake security alerts to steal credentials. Since the question asks if they will continue to use phishing attempts to gain initial access and steal credentials afterward, it is likely that they will do so, given their previous tactics. Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
