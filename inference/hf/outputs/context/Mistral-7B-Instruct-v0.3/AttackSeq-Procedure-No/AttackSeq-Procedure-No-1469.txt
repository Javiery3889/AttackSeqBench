 Final Answer: A: Yes

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Reconnaissance
     - Initial Access (Deliver Remote Access Trojan)
     - Credential Access (Harvest Credentials)
     - Discovery (Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network, Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network)
     - Command and Control (Establish CC Connection)
     - Impact (Develop Malicious Computer Code, Deliver Data Destruction Malware, Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption, Trip Breakers, Sever Connection to Field Devices, Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack, Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage, Destroy Critical System Data)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 establish communication with Command-and-Control servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the Command and Control (Establish CC Connection) step occurs after Initial Access (Deliver Remote Access Trojan), which is initiated through employee-enabled macro execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) establishes communication with Command-and-Control servers only after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution (Initial Access).
   - Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
