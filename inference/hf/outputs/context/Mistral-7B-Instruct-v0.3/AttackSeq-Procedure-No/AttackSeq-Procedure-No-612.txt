 To answer this question, we need to determine if the Bankshot implant uses a COM object to execute queries to gather system information after being executed via exploitation for client execution in the malicious Word document.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878). However, the outline does not provide information about the Bankshot implant using a COM object to execute queries to gather system information.

The Bankshot implant is a remote access tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victim's system, and it contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions. But the outline does not specify that it uses a COM object for system information gathering.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that the Bankshot implant will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information after being executed via exploitation for client execution in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

Final Answer: No.
