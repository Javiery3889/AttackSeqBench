 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by the Lazarus group as described in the CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Lateral Movement
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

In the question, the Lazarus group has already performed Credential Access (step 6) by executing the Responder tool to acquire login credentials. The question then asks if they are likely to perform Wi-Fi discovery before using Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement.

However, the CTI outline does not mention any Wi-Fi discovery technique used by the Lazarus group. Instead, they used Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement (step 7). Therefore, it is not likely that they would perform Wi-Fi discovery before using these techniques.

Final Answer: No.
