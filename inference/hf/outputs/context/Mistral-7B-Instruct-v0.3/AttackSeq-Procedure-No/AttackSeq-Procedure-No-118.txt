 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Exploit CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access
2. Leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services
3. Periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Execution: No direct mention of exploiting CVE-2017-9841 or leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. However, the Tuyul malware does execute shell commands (shell) and runs Perl scripts (perl), which could potentially be used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access.
2. Persistence: The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.

Since the question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-9841 and leveraging legitimate credentials, which are not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, it is not likely that the Tuyul malware will follow this exact sequence.

Final Answer: No (B)
