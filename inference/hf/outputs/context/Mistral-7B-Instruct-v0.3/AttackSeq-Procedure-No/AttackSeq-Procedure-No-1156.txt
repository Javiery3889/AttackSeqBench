 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attackers used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to impersonate technical support or friends of the victims and deliver phishing messages.
   - Credential Access: The attackers collected victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites and changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners. They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI Outline, there is no mention of the attackers stopping any specific services related to backups before changing the passwords. However, they did download all images and messages from the accounts, which could imply that they have access to the data backup feature on Instagram.
   - Answer A suggests that the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners, but there is no evidence to support this in the CTI Outline.
   - Answer B suggests that the attackers will not stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners, which aligns better with the information provided in the CTI Outline.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
