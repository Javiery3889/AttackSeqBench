 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing, watering holes, supply-chain technology exploits
   - Resource Development: Creating or gaining user accounts, remote-desktop protocol
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails, Trojan software
   - Execution: Backdoor malware, in-memory execution
   - Persistence: Creating or gaining user accounts, remote-desktop protocol
   - Defense Evasion: Code from TeamViewer, self-deleting code
   - Lateral Movement: Remote-desktop protocol
   - Impact: Disruptive and destructive action
   - Others: Targeting various industries, links to earlier attacks, code reuse

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems before focusing on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement (Lateral Movement tactic). However, the question does not specify that they focused on Windows systems for system information gathering, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The question does not ask about the Discovery tactic explicitly, but the lateral movement can be considered a part of the Discovery phase as the attackers are gathering information about the network.
   - The question does not mention the Defense Evasion tactic, which includes the use of self-deleting code, but it is not necessary for the question's context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol for lateral movement (Lateral Movement tactic), which can be considered part of the Discovery phase as they are gathering information about the network.
   - The question does not specify that they focused on Windows systems for system information gathering, but the lateral movement can be inferred as part of the Discovery phase.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems before focusing on system information gathering, as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
