 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the SBDH malware does not specifically replace the handler for Word documents to establish persistence. However, it does employ various techniques to evade detection while interacting with its C&C server, such as using HTTP and SMTP protocols, injecting emails into Microsoft Outlook Express, and camouflaging communications with the C&C server using fake image files.

The question asks if it is likely that the malware will employ a persistence technique to replace the handler for Word documents only after using various communication methods to evade detection while interacting with its C&C server. Since the SBDH malware does not replace the handler for Word documents as a persistence technique, the answer is "No".

Final Answer: No.
