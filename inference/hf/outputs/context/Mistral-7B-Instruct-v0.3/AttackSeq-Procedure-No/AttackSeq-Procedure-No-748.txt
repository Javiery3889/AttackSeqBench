 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question. The TTPs relevant to this question are Persistence and Command and Control.

In the CTI outline, the Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process. However, there is no mention of the Rising Sun implant collecting browser bookmark information as part of its TTPs.

The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to collect browser bookmark information as part of discovery before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests. Since there is no evidence in the CTI outline to suggest that the Rising Sun implant collects browser bookmark information, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B: No. The Rising Sun implant is not likely to collect browser bookmark information as part of its TTPs.
