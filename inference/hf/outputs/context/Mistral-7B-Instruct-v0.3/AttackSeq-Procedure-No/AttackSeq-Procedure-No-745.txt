 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Malicious document executed to drop the first payload, a Crimson RAT downloader.
   - Persistence: The first payload downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT and persisted on the system.
   - Defense Evasion: The payload had the capability to kill any process running in the system.
   - Credential Access: The Crimson RAT had functionalities for keylogging and browser credential theft.
   - Command and Control: The payload received commands from the C&C server and supported various commands.
   - Others: The malicious XLS document was used in a spear phishing campaign, and it downloaded a payload from a different URL.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the fully functional Crimson RAT will be downloaded from the specified IP address before the malicious macro code within the XLS document executes to first drop a Crimson RAT downloader.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malicious document executed to drop a downloader, which then downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246. However, the question asks about the sequence of events related to the XLS document, not the IP address mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The XLS document mentioned in the CTI outline downloaded a payload from a different URL (http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll), not the IP address specified in the question.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the fully functional Crimson RAT will be downloaded from the specified IP address before the malicious macro code within the XLS document executes to first drop a Crimson RAT downloader.

In conclusion, the answer is No. The sequence of events described in the question does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.
