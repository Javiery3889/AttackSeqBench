 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: FamousSparrow developed resources by exploiting known vulnerabilities and acquiring infrastructure.
   - Initial Access: FamousSparrow gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.
   - Execution: They executed commands to download and install SparrowDoor.
   - Persistence: FamousSparrow created a registry Run key entry and installed it as a service, and used DLL search order hijacking.
   - Defense Evasion: They injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - Discovery: SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files.
   - Collection: FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them.
   - Command and Control: They communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS.
   - Exfiltration: They exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide specific details about Credential Access techniques used by FamousSparrow. However, it is plausible that they could have used Mimikatz or a similar tool for credential dumping, as it is a common tactic for cyberespionage groups.
   - The Discovery phase in the CTI outline includes the collection of system information and probing files, which could be done after credential dumping to gather more information about the compromised systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - It is possible that FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access, but the CTI report does not provide direct evidence of this. However, given that they are a cyberespionage group and credential dumping is a common tactic, it is plausible that they used Mimikatz or a similar tool.
   - The Discovery phase in the CTI outline includes the collection of system information and probing files, which could be done after credential dumping to gather more information about the compromised systems. Therefore, it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
