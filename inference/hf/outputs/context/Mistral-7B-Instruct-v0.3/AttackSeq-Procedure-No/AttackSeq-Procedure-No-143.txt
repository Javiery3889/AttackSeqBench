 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: July to August 2011, February 2014 - Attacks leveraged unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold.
   - Credential Access: July to August 2011 - Attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through phishing domains.
   - Command and Control: May 2015, 2015 - Second-stage backdoors compromise a number of Japanese companies.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after deploying a second-stage implant to compromise the investment arm of a major Japanese automaker.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the initial access was gained through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, and credential access attempts were made earlier in July to August 2011. However, the second-stage implant was deployed in 2015, and there is no direct evidence that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains after this event.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack group initially gained access to victim networks through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability (Initial Access) and attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through phishing domains (Credential Access) in July to August 2011. The second-stage implant was deployed in 2015 (Command and Control), but there is no direct evidence that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains after this event. Therefore, it is not likely that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains only after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks. (Final Answer: No)
