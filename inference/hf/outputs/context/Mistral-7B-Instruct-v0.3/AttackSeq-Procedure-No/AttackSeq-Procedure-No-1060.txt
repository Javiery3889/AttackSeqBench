 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: JavaScript downloader using ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
   - Execution: PowerShell script loads a DLL, bypasses AMSI, creates registry key HKCU:\software\wow6432node\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate, drops files, and places a VBScript in the Startup folder.
   - Persistence: VBScript in the Startup folder ensures the execution of batch files upon system startup.
   - Command and Control: The final PowerShell script leads to njRAT, which establishes command and control over the victim's computer.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Blind Eagle will use a backdoor to store its configuration in a registry key for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Blind Eagle creates an obfuscated registry key HKCU:\software\wow6432node\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate and places a VBScript in the Startup folder, which aligns with the question's description of storing configuration in a registry key and placing a script in the Startup folder.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the CTI Outline, it is likely that after initial access is gained via a JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands, Blind Eagle will use a backdoor to store its configuration in a registry key for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
