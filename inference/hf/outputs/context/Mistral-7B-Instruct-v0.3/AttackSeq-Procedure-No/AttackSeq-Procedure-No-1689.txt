 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment
   - Execution: Executable file disguised as a document, running scripts and file encryption tool
   - Persistence: Modifying Windows registry, using legitimate applications to collect credentials, and scheduling batch files
   - Credential Access: Collecting credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers using legitimate applications
   - Collection: Recurrently collecting credentials every hour
   - Command and Control: Using FTP command to upload stolen credentials and running batch files for data management and transmission
   - Exfiltration: Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations only before initiating by sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attack used legitimate tools and scripts (legitimate applications to collect credentials, FTP command, batch files) for its operations before initiating the attack with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment that passed through security filters.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack used legitimate tools and scripts for its operations (Credential Access, Command and Control, Exfiltration) before initiating the attack with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment (Initial Access). This PDF attachment passed through security filters and appeared benign, allowing the attack to evade detection. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
