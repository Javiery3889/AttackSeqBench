 To answer this question, we need to identify the Defense Evasion tactic in the CTI outline and determine if it involves using images instead of text in phishing emails.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Defense Evasion tactic was used by the attackers to bypass Google's security systems. They used images instead of text in phishing emails to achieve this.

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:

The question asks if the attackers will use images instead of text in phishing emails after verifying victims' credentials and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

Comparing the question with the CTI outline, we can see that the Defense Evasion tactic (using images instead of text in phishing emails) was used before the Initial Access phase, not after it. Therefore, the attackers would have already used images in their phishing emails before verifying victims' credentials and prompting for the 2-step verification code.

Final Answer: A: Yes (The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails before the Initial Access phase, so it is likely they continued to use this tactic throughout the campaign.)
