 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline and the information provided in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attackers have the capability to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, screenshots, and network details (Collection tactic). However, there is no direct evidence in the CTI outline that suggests the use of applications like Rclone for data exfiltration.

The question asks about the sequence of events after the backdoor communicates with the C&C server and receives a 'Get Victim Information' message. The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the sequence of events after this communication, so we cannot definitively say whether the attackers used Rclone for data exfiltration.

However, it is plausible that the attackers could use Rclone or other data exfiltration tools after collecting the victim's information, but this is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
