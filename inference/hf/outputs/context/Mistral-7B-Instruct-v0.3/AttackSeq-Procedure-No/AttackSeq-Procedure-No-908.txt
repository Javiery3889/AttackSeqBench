 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Use of scripting, Batch files, VBScript, rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments
   - Persistence: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros in documents
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modified registry keys, code signing, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates, obfuscated downloader
   - Discovery: Automatic listing of interesting files for future exfiltration
   - Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for email transmission
   - Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for command and control
   - Exfiltration: Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server
   - Others: Collecting sensitive information, rapid execution and adaptation, use of multiple domains for C&C servers, separate domains for small groups of victims, persistence techniques, strategy of installing multiple scripts and executables on each system

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, it is mentioned that the group uses its Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement by sending emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. However, it does not explicitly state that they collect mail from accessed systems and servers.
   - However, considering the group's strategy of collecting sensitive information and their use of Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, it is plausible that they might also collect emails from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.

4. Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the group will attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers as part of their collection activities.
