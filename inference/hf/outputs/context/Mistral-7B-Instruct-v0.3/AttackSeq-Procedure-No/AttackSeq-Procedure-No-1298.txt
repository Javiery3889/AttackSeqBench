 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline and the question. The question asks about the use of PDQ Deploy for lateral movement after achieving credential access.

In the CTI outline, the TTPs for Credential Access are:
1. Using Procdump and Mimikatz to dump and extract credentials from the Lsass.exe process.
2. Utilizing 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.

However, the CTI outline does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy for lateral movement or any other purpose. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Fox Kitten Campaign would use PDQ Deploy for moving AvosLocker or tools across the network for lateral movement within the target networks.

Final Answer: No.
