 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to gain access.
   - Execution: Flash exploit 'show.swf' executes shellcode for installing a payload.
   - Others: The payload extraction and decryption technique from an animated GIF image was used, but it does not specify that the shellcode execution is only for Defense Evasion after the payload installation.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline mentions that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' executes shellcode for installing a payload, but it does not specify that this shellcode execution is only for Defense Evasion after the payload installation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI Outline does not provide evidence to support the claim that the shellcode execution for Defense Evasion will only occur after the payload installation. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
