 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans, zero-day vulnerabilities, and exploits (CVE-2014-4148) to compromise targets.
   - Discovery: Longhorn's malware has detailed system fingerprinting capabilities.
   - Collection: Longhorn's malware is customizable and designed for espionage-type operations.
   - Command and Control: Longhorn uses operational security measures to hide their identity and communicate with C&C servers over HTTPS.
   - Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times with upload limits and randomized communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Longhorn's tools follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection after detailed system fingerprinting.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, including hiding their identity, communicating with C&C servers over HTTPS, and randomizing communication intervals. These tactics align with the Vault 7 documents' guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.
   - The question does not specify a time frame for the tactics to avoid detection, but the CTI outline indicates that these tactics are used throughout the entire attack sequence, including after detailed system fingerprinting.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After Longhorn performs detailed system fingerprinting for discovery, it is likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents. This is because Longhorn uses operational security measures throughout the entire attack sequence, including after detailed system fingerprinting.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes.
