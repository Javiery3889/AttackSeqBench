 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Initial Access (Exploit: CVE-2014-1776), Execution (Arbitrary code execution via shellcode), Persistence (Payload download), Defense Evasion (Runtime ROP generation, EMET bypass, and EAF mitigation bypass), and Privilege Escalation (Implied, as the attackers are an APT group with a history of accessing higher privileges).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs related to Defense Evasion, specifically whether the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, it is stated that the attackers use Runtime ROP generation to search for specific APIs and construct a ROP chain, which is then used to execute shellcode that makes memory executable and clears debug registers. This shellcode also downloads the next stage of the payload. The shellcode's purpose is to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation. Therefore, the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The zero-day exploit leverages a previously unknown use-after-free vulnerability and a well-known Flash exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and bypass Windows' ASLR and DEP protections. The shellcode, which is part of the exploit, is used to make memory executable and clear debug registers, possibly to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation. Therefore, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections as part of defense evasion (Answer: A).
