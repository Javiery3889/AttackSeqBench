 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems.
   - Initial Access: Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
   - Lateral Movement: Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - Discovery: Emissary Panda used tools to perform network reconnaissance, identifying vulnerable systems and gathering information to facilitate lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance both before and after exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events after the initial access.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question is: Initial Access (exploiting SharePoint vulnerability), Execution (uploading Mimikatz), and Discovery (network reconnaissance). This sequence aligns with the sequence in the CTI Outline: Initial Access, Execution, and Discovery.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI Outline and the question, it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems only after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells. Therefore, the correct answer is "Yes".
