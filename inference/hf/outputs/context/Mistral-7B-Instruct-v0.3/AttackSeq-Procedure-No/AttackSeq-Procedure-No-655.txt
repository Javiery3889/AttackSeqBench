 Final Answer: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - Execution: Use of AntSword to run commands, upload tools like cURL, Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, and atexec.
   - Defense Evasion: Use of custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert tool for evasion.
   - Credential Access: Use of Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass the hash technique.
   - Discovery: Various commands run for system and network discovery.
   - Lateral Movement: Use of webshells, Mimikatz, and Impacket's atexec for lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs involving the use of Impacket's atexec tool and Mimikatz for credential dumping before using AntSword for communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials before using Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. However, the question does not mention the use of AntSword for communication, which is a crucial part of the sequence in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if the threat actors executed commands with Impacket's atexec tool only after moving laterally to other systems using credentials dumped with Mimikatz. The CTI outline shows that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials first, then used Impacket's atexec tool for lateral movement. However, the question does not mention the use of AntSword for communication, which is a crucial part of the sequence in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is not likely that the threat actors executed commands with Impacket's atexec tool only after moving laterally to other systems using credentials dumped with Mimikatz.

Final Answer: No.
