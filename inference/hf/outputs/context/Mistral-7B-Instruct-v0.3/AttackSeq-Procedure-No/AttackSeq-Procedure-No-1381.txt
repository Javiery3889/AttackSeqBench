 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 is known for mapping victim networks and stealing sensitive documents.
   - Initial Access: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - Execution: FIN13 employs JSPRAT and passive backdoors for local command execution.
   - Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses utilities like Mimikatz to extract credentials.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors and trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials.
   - Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives.
   - Command and Control: FIN13 uses various protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 will gather information on services after moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells and obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement (Lateral Movement tactic) and obtains credentials via process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries (Credential Access tactic).
   - The question asks if FIN13 will gather information on services after these actions. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that FIN13 gathers information on services after obtaining credentials, but it does mention that they collect data from network shared drives (Collection tactic), which could include service information.
   - However, the question specifically asks about service discovery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, given the context that FIN13 is known for mapping victim networks (Reconnaissance tactic) and collecting data (Collection tactic), it is plausible that they would gather information on services as part of their reconnaissance and data collection activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - It is plausible that after moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells (Lateral Movement tactic) and obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries (Credential Access tactic), FIN13 will gather information on services (implied by their Reconnaissance and Collection tactics).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
