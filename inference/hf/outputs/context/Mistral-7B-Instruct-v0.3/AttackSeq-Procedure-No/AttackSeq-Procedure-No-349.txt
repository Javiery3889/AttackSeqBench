 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: A dropper malware is used to gain initial access to the system.
   - Execution: The dropper downloads a second-stage payload and executes it.
   - Persistence: The second-stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: The dropper is designed to evade defenses.
   - Command and Control: The malware communicates with the command and control server using HTTPS, and another file contacts a domain in Holland.
   - Others: The attack is associated with APT28, and the attack surface is wide, with C2Cs in Europe and China.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of APT28 evading defenses through the dropper after persisting in the system with 'upnphost.exe' and gathering system information to send it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about APT28 gathering system information and sending it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes. However, the outline does show that the dropper is designed to evade defenses, and the second-stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
   - Answer choice A suggests that APT28 will evade defenses through the dropper only after gathering system information and sending it to a server in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes, which is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.
   - Answer choice B suggests that APT28 will not evade defenses through the dropper after persisting in the system with 'upnphost.exe' and sending it to a server in Holland, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
