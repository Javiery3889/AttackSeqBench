 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and identify the attack sequence:

1. Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access)
2. Execution: Malware installation and persistence (running in the background, restarting after termination)
3. Discovery: Data collection (text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recording, list of installed apps, list of processes, Wi-Fi status)
4. Command and Control: FTP protocol for file uploads

Now, let's analyze the question and its answer choices:

The question asks if the app sends the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device.

Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Comparing the attack sequence with the question, we can see that the data collection routines are performed before the Command and Control operation (FTP file upload). However, the question does not specify any sequence for sending the information via HTTP. Since the CTI outline does not provide information about sending the information via HTTP only after performing routines, we cannot definitively say whether the app sends the information via HTTP only after performing routines or not.

Final Answer: It is not possible to determine the answer with the provided information.
