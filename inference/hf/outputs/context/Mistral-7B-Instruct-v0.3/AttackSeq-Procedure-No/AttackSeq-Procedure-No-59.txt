 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spam emails with fake updates or exploiting current events (e.g., COVID-19)
   - Persistence: Creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory
   - Privilege Escalation: Hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking them at the firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks, registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files
   - Credential Access: Steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook
   - Discovery: Collects information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer before employing numerous tricks to evade detection and emulation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery tactic in the CTI outline involves Grandoreiro collecting information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.
   - The Privilege Escalation tactic involves numerous tricks to evade detection and emulation, as described in the CTI outline.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer before employing numerous tricks to evade detection and emulation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Discovery tactic in the CTI outline indicates that Grandoreiro collects information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, before moving on to other tactics such as Privilege Escalation.
   - The Privilege Escalation tactic in the CTI outline involves numerous tricks to evade detection and emulation, which are employed after the Discovery tactic.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, only before employing numerous tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
