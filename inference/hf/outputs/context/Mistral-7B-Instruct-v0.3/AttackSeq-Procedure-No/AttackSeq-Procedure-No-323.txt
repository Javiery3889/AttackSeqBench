 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline:

1. Initial Access: The attacker uses a poisoned pawn (malware) to gain initial access to the system.
2. Execution: The malware, XAgent, is fully functional and runs in the background, hiding its icon. It can restart itself when terminated, except on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The malware collects various types of information, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

Now, let's analyze the question:

The question asks if it is likely that the malware will collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase.

Answer Choices:
A: Yes
B: No

Comparing and evaluating:
The CTI outline clearly states that the malware collects text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase. Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The malware (XAgent) is designed to collect various types of information.
2. This information includes text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
3. The collection of this information occurs during the Discovery phase, as stated in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
