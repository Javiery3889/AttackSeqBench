 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics and techniques used by Agrius as described in the CTI outline. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers and awaits commands, but there is no mention of it being used for data destruction activities, specifically CaddyWiper.

The CTI outline does mention data exfiltration and the deployment of additional malware, but it does not specify that Agrius uses CaddyWiper for data destruction. Therefore, it is less likely that Agrius will deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems for data destruction activities.

Final Answer: B: No
