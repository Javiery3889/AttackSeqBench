3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Elderwood Project attackers have been compromising various systems, including websites, corporations, and individuals.
   - The question asks about compromising MSPs, which are a type of corporation.
   - The Elderwood Project has shown a systematic approach and a high level of technical capability, suggesting they are capable of compromising MSPs.
   - The question mentions delivering malware to MSP customers, which aligns with the CTI outline's mention of the attackers maintaining control over compromised systems and retrieving commands.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the question, it is likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will breach Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to deliver malware to MSP customers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
