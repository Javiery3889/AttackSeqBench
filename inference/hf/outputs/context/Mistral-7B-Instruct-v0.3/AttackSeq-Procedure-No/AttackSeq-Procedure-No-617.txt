 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations, including Turkish financial systems.
   - Initial Access: Hidden Cobra uses spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The malicious Word document downloads and executes the Bankshot implant from falcancoin.io.
   - Persistence: The Bankshot implant persists on the victim's network for further exploitation.
   - Defense Evasion: The Bankshot implant is designed to evade detection and persist on the victim's network.
   - Command and Control: The implants communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.
   - Others: The campaign targets victims with unpatched versions of Flash, and McAfee detects these threats as RDN/Generic Exploit, among others.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access, which aligns with the Initial Access tactic in the CTI outline.
   - The question also mentions Turkish financial organizations as the target, which aligns with the Reconnaissance tactic in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that Hidden Cobra has targeted Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access. Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will continue to target Turkish financial organizations in this manner.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
