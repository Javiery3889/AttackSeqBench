 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Mustang Panda used phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports to gain initial access.
   - Execution: After gaining initial access, they employed various methods to execute their malware, including DLL side-loading with benign executables.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that Mustang Panda employs stagers to download additional shellcode for execution during command and control. This is consistent with the Execution phase in the CTI Outline.
   - The question also asks if they will execute malware via DLL side-loading with benign executables only after gaining initial access using phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports. This is consistent with the Initial Access and Execution phases in the CTI Outline.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question and the CTI Outline both mention the use of phishing lures, stagers, and DLL side-loading for malware execution. The sequence of events in the question (stagers, DLL side-loading) aligns with the sequence in the CTI Outline (Initial Access, Execution).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question asks if Mustang Panda will execute malware via DLL side-loading with benign executables only after gaining initial access using phishing lures related to official European Union and Ukrainian government reports.
   - According to the CTI Outline, Mustang Panda did indeed use phishing lures for initial access, and they employed DLL side-loading for malware execution. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
