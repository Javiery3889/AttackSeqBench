 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Cobalt Strike's beacon is used for initial compromise and establishment of a foothold.
   - Privilege Escalation: After initial compromise, attackers seek to escalate privileges using Mimikatz, UAC bypass, or LPE vulnerabilities.
   - Defense Evasion: Cobalt Strike provides techniques to bypass detection during network communications and process execution.
   - Discovery: After privilege escalation, attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to collect information about the network and connected PCs.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question discusses lateral movement using direct shell commands and Cobalt Strike features, followed by the question of whether attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning for discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after privilege escalation, attackers perform discovery using ADFind and port scanning. The question discusses lateral movement, which is a step before discovery in the attack sequence.
   - The question mentions the use of ADFind and port scanning in the discovery phase, which aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI outline.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the attack sequence in the CTI outline and the details in the question, it is likely that attackers will use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information as part of the discovery process after lateral movement. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
