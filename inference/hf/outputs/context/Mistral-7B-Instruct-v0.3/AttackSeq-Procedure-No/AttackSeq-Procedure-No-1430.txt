 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
   - Execution: Smooth Operator executes as part of the 3CX software.
   - Persistence: Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
   - Defense Evasion: Smooth Operator employs several defense evasion techniques, but there's no mention of accessing or downloading information from SharePoint instances.
   - Discovery: Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json.
   - Command and Control: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
   - Exfiltration: Smooth Operator exfiltrates collected data, not over the existing C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Smooth Operator is likely to access and download information stored in SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention any activity related to accessing or downloading information from SharePoint instances before communicating with its C2 servers over HTTPS.

4. Final Answer:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline, Smooth Operator does not appear to access and download information stored in SharePoint instances before performing HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
