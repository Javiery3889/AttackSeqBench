 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: SSL-VPN abuse, no spear-phishing, exploiting SSL-VPN vulnerabilities or using stolen credentials.
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through DESLoader, fileless RATs (SodaMaster), and PowerShell remoting.
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks created to load DESLoader every 15 minutes.
   - Defense Evasion: Fileless implants, DLL side-loading, event log removal, obfuscated PowerShell commands.
   - Credential Access: Internal network scanning, using administrator accounts, dumping credentials from AD servers, file servers, and backup servers.
   - Discovery: Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC, deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
   - Command and Control: Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting, IP addresses over domains for C2 infrastructure, little reuse of IP addresses for C2.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network before conducting discovery activities such as scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC and deploying tools to uncover domain accounts.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the A41APT campaign initially accessed the network via SSL-VPN, but later used RDP to deploy to servers (Credential Access). After that, they scanned for open RDP and SMB ports (Discovery). Therefore, it is likely that they will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network before conducting discovery activities.

4. Final Answer: Yes. The A41APT campaign is likely to utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network before conducting discovery activities such as scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC and deploying tools to uncover domain accounts.
