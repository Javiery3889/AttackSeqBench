 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to download and install a backdoor.
   - Execution: Dropper (UserInstall.exe) launches sidebar.exe, which loads the malicious wab32res.dll and injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
   - Persistence: Backdoor connects to C&C servers using SSL.
   - Defense Evasion: DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection, and creating a hidden directory as a ruse.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events where Tropic Trooper uses SSL to connect to its C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the backdoor (TClient) uses SSL to connect to the C&C server during the Persistence phase, not Defense Evasion.
   - Answer choice A suggests that TClient uses SSL before Defense Evasion, which is not the case based on the provided CTI outline.
   - Answer choice B correctly states that TClient does not use SSL during the Defense Evasion phase.

Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
