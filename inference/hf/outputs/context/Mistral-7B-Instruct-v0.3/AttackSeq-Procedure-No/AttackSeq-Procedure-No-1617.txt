 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attacker uses various methods to install Regin, including tricking targets into visiting spoofed websites, exploiting a web browser, or using Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - Execution: Regin's multi-staged architecture is detailed, with Stage 5 injecting files into services.exe.
   - Persistence: Regin is designed to maintain a long-term presence on infected systems, but no specific persistence mechanisms are mentioned.
   - Defense Evasion: Regin conceals itself and its activities using encrypted data blobs and stealth techniques.
   - Credential Access: Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic, including credential information.
   - Discovery: Regin gathers information on processes, memory utilization, scans for deleted files, and monitors network traffic.
   - Command and Control: Regin uses encrypted and bidirectional C&C operations, with various modules for C&C.
   - Exfiltration: Regin encodes and embeds payload information within cookie data and exfiltrates data through various channels.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Regin's discovery capabilities include gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Regin's discovery capabilities, as outlined in the CTI report, include gathering information on processes, memory utilization, and scanning for deleted files. Therefore, it is likely that Regin will gather this information during the discovery phase.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
