 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question: Credential Access (scraping files) and Exfiltration (automatically exfiltrating files).

Now, let's compare these TTPs with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Execution
2. Persistence
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Defense Evasion
5. Credential Access
6. Collection
7. Command and Control
8. Exfiltration
9. Impact

From the CTI outline, we can see that Credential Access (scraping files) and Exfiltration (automatically exfiltrating files) are present in the sequence.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:
A: Yes - This answer choice aligns with the sequence in the CTI outline, as Infamous Chisel does scrape credential-containing files for Credential Access and then automatically exfiltrates the files using Tor hidden services for Exfiltration.
B: No - This answer choice is not supported by the sequence in the CTI outline, as Infamous Chisel does perform both Credential Access and Exfiltration in sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes. Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services before enumerating system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery.
