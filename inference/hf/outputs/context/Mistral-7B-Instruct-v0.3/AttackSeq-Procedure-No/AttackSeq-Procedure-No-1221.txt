 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: T9000 was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
   - Execution: T9000 sideloaded a malicious DLL and initiated the next stage of execution.
   - Persistence: T9000 established persistence through registry keys and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe.
   - Defense Evasion: T9000 customized its installation to avoid security products and ensured only one instance ran via mutexes and named events.
   - Collection: T9000 captured data about the infected system, targeted Skype users, and stole files.
   - Exfiltration: T9000 exfiltrated data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions that T9000 communicates with a C2 server and then captures data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that T9000 captures data (Collection) and exfiltrates it (Exfiltration). The Defense Evasion tactic in the CTI outline involves customizing the installation to avoid security products and ensuring only one instance runs, which aligns with the question's context of evading detection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The T9000 malware communicates with a C2 server (Exfiltration) and then captures data from the victim's system, including Skype communications and file theft (Collection). After evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid security products and ensuring only one instance runs via mutexes and named events (Defense Evasion), it is likely to capture data from the victim's system.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
