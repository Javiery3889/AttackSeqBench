 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses utilities like Mimikatz to extract credentials and ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 will dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory, which is a method for obtaining credentials. This action is part of the Privilege Escalation phase, but it can be considered a precursor to Reconnaissance as the obtained credentials can be used to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - The answer choice "Yes" aligns best with the attack sequence and the contextual information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the final answer is "Yes". FIN13 is likely to dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
