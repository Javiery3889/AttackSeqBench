 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign distributing Zebrocy components.
   - Persistence: COM object hijacking for persistence, adding custom registry keys.
   - Defense Evasion: Malware deletes files and kills processes.
   - Credential Access: Uploading and using dumpers on victims' machines.
   - Discovery: Gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - Collection: Malware scans for files, stages data, and has features for input capture and screen capture.
   - Command and Control: Downloaders and backdoors communicate with the C&C server.
   - Exfiltration: Data are automatically prepared and sent to the C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit group's operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails after employing COM object hijacking for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the initial access was gained through a spearphishing email campaign distributing Zebrocy components. After gaining initial access, the operators used a downloader (written in Delphi) to download and execute a new downloader. This sequence aligns with the question's context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial access was gained through a spearphishing email campaign, and after gaining access, a downloader was used to download and execute a new downloader. This sequence suggests that the operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails and use a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
