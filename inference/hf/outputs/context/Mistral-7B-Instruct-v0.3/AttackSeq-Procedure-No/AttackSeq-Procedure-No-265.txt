 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs in the question:
1. Establishing persistence
2. Exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol
3. Collecting information about the system, including using the GetSystemTime function for system time discovery

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks
2. Execution: Uses a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant
3. Persistence: Establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under %allusersprofile% and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry
4. Defense Evasion: Uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques
5. Collection: Collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives
6. Command and Control: Communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol
7. Exfiltration: Exfiltrates data via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands

From the CTI outline, we can see that the sequence of TTPs in the question (Establishing persistence, Exfiltrating data, and Collecting information) is present in the attack sequence, but the order is different. The order in the question is not the same as the order in the CTI outline.

The CTI outline shows that the Korplug variant collects information about the system before exfiltrating data. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Korplug variant will exfiltrate data via a custom TCP-based protocol before collecting information about the system, including using the GetSystemTime function for system time discovery.

Final Answer: No.
