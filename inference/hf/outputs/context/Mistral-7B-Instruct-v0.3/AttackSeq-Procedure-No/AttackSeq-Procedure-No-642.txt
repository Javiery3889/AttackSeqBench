 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploits on compromised websites, spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents.
   - Execution: Malicious Word documents executed code using VBA macros.
   - Command and Control: Communication with C&C servers using HTTPS.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions renting servers from ServerAstra and acquiring domain names through Njalla, but there's no mention of tracking pixels, phishing victims, or browser exploitation through fingerprinting in the question.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of servers to validate tracking pixels or exploiting visitors' browsers through fingerprinting.
   - The question mentions elements (tracking pixels, phishing victims, browser exploitation) that are not present in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not support the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The question mentions elements (tracking pixels, phishing victims, browser exploitation) that are not present in the CTI outline, and there's no evidence to suggest that these elements were part of the attack sequence.

Final Answer: No. The attackers did not likely use servers under their control to validate tracking pixels sent to phishing victims before exploiting visitorsâ€™ browsers through fingerprinting, based on the information provided in the CTI outline.
