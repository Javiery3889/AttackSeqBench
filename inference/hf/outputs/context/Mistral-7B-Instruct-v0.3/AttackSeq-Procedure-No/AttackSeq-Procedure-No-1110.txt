 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits
   - Execution: Uses a loader to execute the malware
   - Persistence: Creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service
   - Credential Access: Steals credentials from various software and Windows systems
   - Collection: Collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer
   - Command and Control: Communicates with remote servers and uses FTP for exfiltration
   - Exfiltration: Automatically uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke will enumerate Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention any activity related to enumerating Azure AD users.
   - The activities mentioned in the question (enumerating Azure AD users) are not part of the known TTPs for CosmicDuke.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not indicate that CosmicDuke enumerates Azure AD users as part of its TTPs.
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke will enumerate Azure AD users, which is not a known TTP for this threat actor. Therefore, the answer is "No."
