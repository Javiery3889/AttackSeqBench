 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by CosmicDuke as described in the CTI outline.

1. Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits are used to trick victims into opening a malicious file.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute on the system.
3. Persistence: CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: CosmicDuke steals various types of credentials, including Windows credentials and those for various software applications.
5. Discovery: CosmicDuke searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
6. Command and Control: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware.
7. Exfiltration: The collected data is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

However, the CTI outline does not provide information about CosmicDuke using a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer. The only information provided is that CosmicDuke steals credentials, but it does not specify the methods used to gather these credentials. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer.

Final Answer: It is not possible to determine with the provided information whether CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.
