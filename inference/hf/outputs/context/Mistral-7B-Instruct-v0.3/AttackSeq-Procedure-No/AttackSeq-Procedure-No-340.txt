 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Persistence: Nemesis bootkit infects the system's VBR to execute before the Windows operating system boots, making detection and removal challenging.
   - Command and Control: Nemesis provides capabilities such as file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the malware evading detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. However, the outline does mention that the malware's persistence and execution before the Windows operating system boots make it challenging to detect and remove. This suggests that the malware may not rely on hiding its files in excluded directories to evade detection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware's persistence is achieved by infecting the system's VBR, which allows it to execute before the Windows operating system boots. This technique is rare and makes the malware difficult to detect and eradicate. The malware's capabilities, such as file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling, suggest that it may have other methods for evading detection, but the CTI outline does not provide evidence to support the idea that it hides its install files in excluded directories.
   - Final Answer: B: No. The malware is likely not evading detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning.
