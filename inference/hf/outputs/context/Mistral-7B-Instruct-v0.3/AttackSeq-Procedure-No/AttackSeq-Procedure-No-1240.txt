 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics and techniques used by APT28 as described in the CTI outline. DNS tunneling is a defense evasion technique used to communicate with C2 servers, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that APT28 uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers, which would otherwise not be accessible from outside the network. This technique could potentially be used for communication with C2 servers, but it's not the same as DNS tunneling.

So, based on the information provided, it's not likely that APT28 will use DNS tunneling for command and control communication (Answer: No). However, it's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and advanced threat actors like APT28 may employ a variety of techniques to maintain their operations.

Final Answer: No.
