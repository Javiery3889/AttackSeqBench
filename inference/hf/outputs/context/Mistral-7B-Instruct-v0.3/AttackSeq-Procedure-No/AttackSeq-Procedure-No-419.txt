 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Email attachment and .src file
   - Persistence: Windows shortcut in the startup folder

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the actor initially gains access through an email attachment and a .src file, and then creates a Windows shortcut for persistence. The question asks if it is likely that the operator will execute arbitrary code on the infected host only after using an email attachment and social engineering to prompt the target to execute a .src file for initial access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline shows that the actor first gains initial access through an email attachment and .src file, and then creates a Windows shortcut for persistence. This sequence aligns with the question, which asks if the operator will execute arbitrary code (the .src file) after achieving persistence. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
