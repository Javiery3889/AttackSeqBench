 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The CTI report describes the use of masscan to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
   - It also mentions the use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations.
   - The report highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces will be conducted during the discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the cybercriminals used masscan and specialized search engines for reconnaissance, and they discovered Building Management systems with the Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
   - The question's sequence of TTPs (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures) matches the attack sequence in the CTI outline.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes".
