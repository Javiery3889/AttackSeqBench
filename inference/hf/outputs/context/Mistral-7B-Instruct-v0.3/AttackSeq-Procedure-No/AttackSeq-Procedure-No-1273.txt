 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: SocGholish framework was used to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.
   - Discovery: The attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group to profile the computer, indicating a reconnaissance phase.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the attackers used the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attack started with Initial Access using the SocGholish framework, which is a method of delivering malicious JavaScript. The Discovery phase, which involves reconnaissance, follows this initial access. Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers used the SocGholish framework during the Reconnaissance phase.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The attackers used the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript during the Reconnaissance phase.
