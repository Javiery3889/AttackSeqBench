 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: JavaScript downloader -> PowerShell commands
   - Execution: PowerShell script -> DLL loading -> AMSI bypass -> registry manipulation -> dropping files -> VBScript in Startup folder
   - Persistence: VBScript in Startup folder
   - Defense Evasion: AMSI bypass, obfuscation
   - Others: APT Blind Eagle, PowerShell, Scripting, Startup Folder, Process Injection, Masquerading, Sandbox Evasion, Application Layer Protocol

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if actions to maintain persistence will be performed after the myScript.ps1 PowerShell script is executed and njRAT establishes command and control over the victim's computer.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, the persistence stage involves a VBScript named Login1.vbs placed in the Startup folder, which ensures the execution of the SystemLogin.bat batch file upon system startup. Since the myScript.ps1 PowerShell script is dropped in the fourth stage, it is likely that the persistence stage (which includes the VBScript) will be performed after the myScript.ps1 PowerShell script is executed.

4. Conclusion:
   - After leveraging an obfuscated batch script in the system to execute the myScript.ps1 PowerShell script and having njRAT establish command and control over the victim's computer, it is likely that actions to maintain persistence will be performed, as the CTI outline shows the persistence stage occurring after the myScript.ps1 PowerShell script execution. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
