 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing, phishing mass-mailing, compromised websites, drive-by downloads.
   - Execution: Download programs for remote, hidden administration.
   - Defense Evasion: Set up malware within infrastructure software, reinstall malware when deleted by security software.
   - Discovery: Use remote administration tools to explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Russian-speaking cybercriminals will explore the financial systems of the targeted organizations using remote administration tools in the discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly indicates that the cybercriminals use remote administration tools in the discovery phase to gain system administrators' credentials and explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The cybercriminals first gain initial access to the targeted organization through various methods such as spear-phishing, phishing mass-mailing, compromised websites, or drive-by downloads.
   - Once they have access, they execute malware to gain system administrator credentials and download programs for remote, hidden administration.
   - To evade defenses, they set up malware within the infrastructure software of the attacked organization and reinstall the malware when deleted by security software.
   - In the discovery phase, they use remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.
   - After causing multi-million dollar losses and transferring or withdrawing money during the impact phase, it is likely that they will continue to explore the financial systems of the targeted organizations using remote administration tools in the discovery phase.

Therefore, the final answer is "Yes".
