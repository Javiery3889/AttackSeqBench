 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. T1553 Subvert Trust Controls (Defense Evasion)
2. T1057 Process Discovery (Discovery)
3. T1071 Application Layer Protocol (Command and Control)

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, with the sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain
2. Execution: T1072 Software Deployment Tools, T1569 System Services
3. Defense Evasion: T1070 Indicator Removal on Host, T1036 Masquerading, T1553 Subvert Trust Controls, T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion
4. Command and Control: T1071 Application Layer Protocol, T1568 Dynamic Resolution

As we can see, the question's sequence (1-Defense Evasion, 3-Command and Control, 2-Discovery) does not directly match the attack sequence from the CTI outline. However, it's important to note that the CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence for the Discovery phase, and the question's sequence could potentially be a plausible sequence of TTPs after the Defense Evasion and Command and Control phases.

However, the CTI outline does not suggest that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol. Therefore, the most plausible answer to the question is "No".

Final Answer: No.
