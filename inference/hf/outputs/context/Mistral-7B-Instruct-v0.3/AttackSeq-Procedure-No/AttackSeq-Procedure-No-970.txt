 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (malware in self-extracting RAR files)
   - Execution: Malware execution from disguised executable files (e.g., 'IDF strikes militants in Gaza Strip following rocket barrage.doc.scr')
   - Command and Control: Communication with command-and-control (C&C) structures hosted on DynDNS services with changing and static IPs

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions executing a malicious script and using command-and-control infrastructure with changing and static IPs hosted on DynDNS services.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers disguise executable malware files with legitimate-looking document names for execution. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of verclsid.exe or downloading and executing a malicious script before using command-and-control infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively say whether the attackers use verclsid.exe to download and execute a malicious script before utilizing command-and-control infrastructure. The outline only mentions the malware being disguised as documents and communicating with C&C structures.
   - Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
