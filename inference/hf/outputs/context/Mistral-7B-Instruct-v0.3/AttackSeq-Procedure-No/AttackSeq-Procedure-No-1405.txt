 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers information on victim networks and steals sensitive documents.
   - Initial Access: FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
   - Execution: FIN13 uses JSPRAT and passive backdoors for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
   - Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords.
   - Privilege Escalation: FIN13 uses utilities like ProcDump, Mimikatz, certutil, and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities.
   - Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials (Credential Access). After gaining credentials, they use WMI for lateral movement (Lateral Movement). The outline also mentions that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives (Collection), which could include user account information. Therefore, it is plausible that FIN13 would leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After using WMI for lateral movement across the victim network, FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing (Yes).
