 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.
   - Initial Access: The Rising Sun implant was downloaded via a malicious document and a control server.
   - Execution: The shellcode executed by the macro downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
   - Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence on the system.
   - Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performed additional reconnaissance and decrypted additional information.
   - Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypted data and exfiltrated it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 before exfiltrating data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the Rising Sun implant communicating with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
   - The Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data to a control server via HTTP POST requests, but there is no mention of Jabber/XMPP communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Rising Sun implant does not communicate with servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2 before exfiltrating data. The CTI outline does not provide any evidence to suggest otherwise. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
