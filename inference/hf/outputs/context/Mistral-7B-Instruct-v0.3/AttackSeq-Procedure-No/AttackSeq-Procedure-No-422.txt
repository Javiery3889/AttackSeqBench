 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - Execution: VBS macro executes, downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab payloads.
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding disk writes.
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads.
   - Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are downloaded and executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The attack sequence involves phishing emails, macros, PowerShell scripts, and malware downloads, but no mention of FortiOS exploitation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The observed campaign does not appear to involve exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not align with the answer choices provided. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.
