 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and targets specific information for fraudulent transactions.
2. Lateral Movement: The question implies a movement within the network, but it does not explicitly mention lateral movement tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE.
3. Discovery: Native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

The question's sequence (Collection, Lateral Movement, Discovery) does not directly match any of the sequences in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does mention lateral movement (Defense Evasion: chaining web shells for complex pivots) and discovery (Discovery: FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance).

The question does not mention tools like Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE, which are not known to be used by FIN13 according to the CTI outline. Therefore, it is less likely that FIN13 will use these tools for lateral movement.

Final Answer: No. FIN13 is more likely to use web shells for lateral movement, rather than Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.
