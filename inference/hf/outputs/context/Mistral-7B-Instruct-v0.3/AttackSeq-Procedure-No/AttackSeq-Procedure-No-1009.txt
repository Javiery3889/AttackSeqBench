 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious documents containing Tajik language text and file names are used to trick victims into enabling macros and activating the payload. Some payloads are embedded, while others are downloaded from the internet.
   - Execution: After enabling the macros, a payload executes and creates two files in the ProgramData directory. The VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - Persistence: The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence.
   - Discovery and Collection: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots before sending this data to a C&C server.
   - Command and Control: The communication with the C&C server is encrypted and uses XML messages with supported commands. The backdoor finds out the machine IP address and collects system information about the infected machine.
   - Others: The attackers use obfuscation and publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that the initial access is indeed through malicious documents, and the attackers use obfuscation and publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics. Therefore, it is likely that payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

4. Final Answer: A: Yes
