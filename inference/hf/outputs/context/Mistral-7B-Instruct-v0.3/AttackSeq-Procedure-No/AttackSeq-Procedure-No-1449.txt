 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Resource Development (T1583.003, T1584), Execution (T1204, T1204.002), Persistence (T1547.001, T1574.001, T1574.002), Defense Evasion (T1027.006, T1140, T1553.005, T1574.001, T1574.002).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the adversary indeed used VPSs to host malware C2s (T1584) and compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts (T1583.003). Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The adversary is likely to develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
