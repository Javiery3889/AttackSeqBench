 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Higaisa APT group distributed malicious LNK files.
   - Execution: Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack involving several commands, including executing a JavaScript file.
   - Defense Evasion: The attack employs commands to bypass security detection.
   - Discovery: The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' to discover IP address information.
   - Command and Control: The final shellcode within the attack communicates with a C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely the JavaScript file will configure payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD and add 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention any actions related to LD_PRELOAD or adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks. The JavaScript file's actions are limited to creating 'd3reEW.exe' and making HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Higaisa APT group's actions, as described in the CTI outline, do not include configuring payloads to load via LD_PRELOAD or adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks. Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript file will perform these actions.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
