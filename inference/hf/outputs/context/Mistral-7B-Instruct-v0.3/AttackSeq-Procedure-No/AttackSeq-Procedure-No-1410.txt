 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Employ JSPRAT for local command execution
2. Leverage BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution
3. Persist via startup options for Login Items
4. Use tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to escalate privileges

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: FIN13 establishes a foothold using web shells and custom malware.
2. Execution: FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
3. Privilege Escalation: FIN13 utilizes common privilege escalation techniques, including Mimikatz and ProcDump.

From the CTI outline, we can see that FIN13 uses JSPRAT and BLUEAGAVE for execution, but there is no direct mention of persisting via startup options for Login Items before escalating privileges. However, since FIN13 is known for long-term intrusions, they might persist in various ways, but the CTI outline does not provide specific details about this step.

Given the information available, it is not possible to definitively say whether FIN13 is likely to persist via startup options for Login Items before using tools like Mimikatz and ProcDump to escalate privileges.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
