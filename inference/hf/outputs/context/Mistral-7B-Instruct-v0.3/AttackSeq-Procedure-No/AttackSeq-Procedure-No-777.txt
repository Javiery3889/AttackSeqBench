 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: The malicious XLS attachment downloads a malicious MSI package using a VB macro.
   - Persistence: The MSI package installs an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.
   - Defense Evasion: The MSI package uses obfuscation techniques like using an outdated version of WiX Toolset and modifying the legitimate Windows Lua interpreter to suppress console output.
   - Command and Control: The SunSeed malware, installed by the MSI package, communicates with the C2 server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution after the MSI package achieves persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malicious XLS attachment initially downloads a malicious MSI package using a VB macro, and the question asks if it is likely that the malicious XLS attachment will continue to use a VB macro to download a malicious MSI package. Since the initial attack sequence involves the use of a VB macro for downloading the MSI package, it is likely that the malicious XLS attachment will use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The malicious XLS attachment is likely to use a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution.
