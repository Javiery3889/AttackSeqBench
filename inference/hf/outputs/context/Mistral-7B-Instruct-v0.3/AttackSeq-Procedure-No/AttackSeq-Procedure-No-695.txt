 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscation techniques within the VBS script and self-deletion after execution
   - Persistence: Registering a RUN key in the Windows registry
   - Command and Control: Communication with a C&C server and execution of a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs")

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of events after initial access is gained through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures.
   - The question mentions the execution of a VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe'.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the VBS script is executed after the initial access, and it is responsible for registering a RUN key in the Windows registry for persistence.
   - The question mentions the execution of the VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe', which aligns with the CTI outline, as the VBS script is executed after the initial access.
   - The question does not specify the order of events after the VBScript execution, but the CTI outline shows that the RUN key registration happens before the VBScript execution for persistence purposes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After gaining initial access through malicious document files sent via emails exploiting COVID-19 lures, the Gamaredon group will execute the VBScript ("PlayList.vbs") using 'wscript.exe'.
   - Before executing the VBScript, the group will register a RUN key in the Windows registry to ensure its execution at every system startup for persistence.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the group will achieve persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry before executing the VBScript ("PlayList.vbs").
   - Final Answer: Yes.
