 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The Dexphot attack involved writing key files to disk, including a loader DLL, which was loaded into system processes via process hollowing. Specifically, it targeted legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe, and later svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The CTI outline clearly indicates that Dexphot used process hollowing as part of its execution stage tactics. Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence and contextual information is "Yes".
