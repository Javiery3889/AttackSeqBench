 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The malware performs discovery activities to collect system and network information.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses process hollowing and obfuscates its second-stage payload retrieval.
   - Initial Access: The attackers used a spear-phishing email to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The malware executes a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and injects malicious code.
   - Discovery: The malware performs discovery activities to collect system and network information.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question mentions that the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands. In the CTI outline, the malware performs discovery activities after executing the second-stage payload, which is done through process hollowing and obfuscation. The use of a custom base64 alphabet for command encoding is also mentioned in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities after communicating with C2 servers.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information.
