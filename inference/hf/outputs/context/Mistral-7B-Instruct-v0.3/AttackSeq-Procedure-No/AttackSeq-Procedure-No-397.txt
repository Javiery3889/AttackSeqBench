 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Impact.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if APT41 is likely to leverage malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers before deploying Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we can see that APT41 uses credential stealers and keyloggers as part of the Credential Access tactic, which occurs before the Persistence tactic where MBR bootkits are deployed. Therefore, it is likely that APT41 will leverage malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers before deploying Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. APT41 is likely to leverage malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers before deploying Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits.
