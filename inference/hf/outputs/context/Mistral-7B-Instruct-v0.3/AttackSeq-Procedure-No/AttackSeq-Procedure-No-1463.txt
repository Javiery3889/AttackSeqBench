 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Impact.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the CTI outline include reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the BlackEnergy 3 malware will enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question include internal network reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that after the initial access, the BlackEnergy 3 malware is installed on the targeted network. Then, the malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions (Credential Access and Discovery). After gathering valid credentials, adversaries use the stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new privileged accounts (Credential Access). This sequence aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question does not explicitly mention the establishment of a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server. However, it is likely that this connection will be established later in the attack sequence, as shown in the CTI outline (Execution, Impact).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The BlackEnergy 3 malware, after being installed on the targeted network, conducts credential harvesting and network discovery functions (Credential Access and Discovery). This sequence aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question, making it likely that the malware will enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server.
