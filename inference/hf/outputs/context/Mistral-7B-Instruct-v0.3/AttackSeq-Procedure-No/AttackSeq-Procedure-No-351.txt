 To answer this question, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file (svchost.exe).
   - Command and Control: MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with its C&C servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the initial access and the potential download of the RAT component from a specific IP address (213.136.87[.]122:10001). It also asks about the establishment of command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document, and the malware (MSIL/Crimson) uses a custom TCP protocol for command and control. However, the question does not explicitly state that the RAT component is downloaded immediately after the initial access.
   - The question does not mention any specific sequence of events after the initial access, such as establishing command and control, downloading the RAT component, and then executing on the victim's machine.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline suggests that the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for command and control, but it does not specify the exact sequence of events after the initial access.
   - The question asks if the MSIL/Crimson malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before downloading the RAT component and executing on the victim's machine. Since the CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question, we cannot confirm whether the sequence of events as described in the question is likely.

Final Answer: It is not possible to definitively answer this question based on the provided information.
