 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets, in this case, using a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - Discovery: Longhorn's malware has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - Collection: While not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would perform remote control and data collection after system discovery.
   - Command and Control: Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, including hiding their real identity and using privacy services for C&C servers.
   - Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Longhorn's malware has detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities, which aligns with the question's focus on system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - The CTI outline also shows that Longhorn uses operational security measures to avoid detection, which aligns with the question's mention of guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - After infecting a target with Plexor malware, it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware (as per the Discovery section in the CTI outline).
   - After system discovery, Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection, such as using operational security measures and hiding their real identity (as per the Command and Control section in the CTI outline).
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
