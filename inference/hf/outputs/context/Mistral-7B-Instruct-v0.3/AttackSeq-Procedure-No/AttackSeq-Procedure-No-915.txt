 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
   - Execution: Use of scripting, rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments
   - Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry key modification, code signing, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates, obfuscated downloader
   - Discovery: Automatic listing of interesting files for future exfiltration
   - Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system
   - Collection: Sensitive document search, drive scanning for sensitive data
   - Command and Control: Use of both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control
   - Exfiltration: Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C server
   - Others: Persistence techniques, strategy of installing multiple scripts and executables, rapid execution and adaptation

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system for Lateral Movement only after employing modified registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Gamaredon does employ modified registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion, and later performs Lateral Movement by injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system. Therefore, it is likely that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system for Lateral Movement only after employing modified registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion.

4. Final Answer: Yes
