 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) in the CTI outline and the capabilities of the backdoor installed by the attackers.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the backdoor has the capability to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including system information, but there is no explicit mention of it having the capability to deploy CaddyWiper or wipe files related to OT (Operational Technology) capabilities and physical drive partitions.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that the backdoor will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.

Final Answer: B: No
