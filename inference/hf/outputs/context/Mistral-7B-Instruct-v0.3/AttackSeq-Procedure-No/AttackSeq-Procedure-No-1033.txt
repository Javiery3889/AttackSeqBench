 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT10 gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - Execution: APT10 deployed Trochilus malware and a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor.
   - Privilege Escalation: APT10 conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - Defense Evasion: APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - Credential Access: The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - Lateral Movement: APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts.
   - Collection: APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - Command and Control: The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs during the Collection phase, specifically if the attackers will compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR only afterward.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR during the Collection phase, and then exfiltrated the data to a Dropbox account using cURL for Windows. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase only afterward.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers gained access to the network, executed malware, escalated privileges, evaded detection, accessed credentials, moved laterally, and collected data. During the Collection phase, they compressed the data using WinRAR and exfiltrated it to Dropbox using cURL for Windows. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase only afterward (Answer: A).
