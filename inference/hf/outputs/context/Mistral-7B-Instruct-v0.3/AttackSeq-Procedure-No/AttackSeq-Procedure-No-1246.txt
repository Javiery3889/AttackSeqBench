 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: SUNSPOT malware inserts SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds.
   - Persistence: SUNSPOT maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.
   - Privilege Escalation: SUNSPOT grants itself debugging privileges.
   - Defense Evasion: SUNSPOT employs several defense evasion techniques.
   - Discovery: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware as part of the Impact tactic after monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about SUNSPOT engaging in double-extortion ransomware or the Impact tactic. However, the Discovery tactic is mentioned, which involves monitoring for MsBuild.exe.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Discovery tactic (monitoring for MsBuild.exe) does not necessarily imply that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware or the Impact tactic. Therefore, it is not likely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware as part of the Impact tactic. Final Answer: B: No.
