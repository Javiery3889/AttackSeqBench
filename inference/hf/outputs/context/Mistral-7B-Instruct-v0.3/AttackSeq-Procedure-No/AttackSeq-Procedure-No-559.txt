 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The Syrian Malware Team uses BlackWorm RAT for command and control, with the malware communicating to specific IP addresses and ports (Command and Control tactic).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Syrian Malware Team would use BlackWorm RAT for command and control before utilizing defense evasion capabilities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline confirms that the Syrian Malware Team uses BlackWorm RAT for command and control, which aligns with the question's requirement of using the malware for command and control.
   - The question does not specify a particular sequence of TTPs, so the defense evasion capabilities mentioned in the CTI outline are not relevant to the question.

4. Conclusion:
   - The Syrian Malware Team uses BlackWorm RAT for command and control, which is the primary function of the malware. Therefore, it is likely that they would use BlackWorm RAT for command and control before utilizing defense evasion capabilities.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
