 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: APT15 gained access through stolen VPN certificates and compromised domain administrator credentials.
   - Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors, including RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS.
   - Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution.
   - Collection: APT15 used tools like Mimikatz for OS credential dumping.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if APT15 is likely to deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution before using Mimikatz for OS credential dumping.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT15 deployed RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution (Execution tactic) before using Mimikatz for OS credential dumping (Privilege Escalation tactic).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - APT15 gained initial access to the network and compromised domain administrator credentials (Initial Access).
   - After gaining access, they deployed RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution (Execution).
   - Subsequently, they used Mimikatz for OS credential dumping (Privilege Escalation).
   - Therefore, the answer is "Yes", APT15 is likely to deploy tools like RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS for execution evasion and command execution before using Mimikatz for OS credential dumping.
