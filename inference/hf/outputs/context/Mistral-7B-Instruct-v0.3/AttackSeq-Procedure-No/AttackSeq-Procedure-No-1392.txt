 To answer this question, we need to consider the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used by FIN13 as described in the CTI outline.

From the outline, FIN13's TTPs for reconnaissance involve gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware. However, there is no evidence that FIN13 has targeted AWS Secrets Manager specifically.

The enum_secrets module is a tool used for enumerating AWS Secrets Manager secrets. While FIN13 is known to use various tools for reconnaissance, the enum_secrets module is not among them, as per the information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, it is unlikely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

Final Answer: No.
