 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: FIN4 targets individuals with access to confidential information and uses spearphishing emails to capture usernames and passwords.
   - Resource Development: FIN4 organizes their targets using unique 'campaign codes'.
   - Initial Access: FIN4 gains initial access to their targets' information through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.
   - Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to delete emails containing certain keywords.
   - Command and Control: FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials and has been observed using specific domains for their C2 infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials only after transmitting stolen credentials to their C2 servers for credential access and labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' during resource development.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros for Initial Access (to gain initial access to their targets' information) and Resource Development (to label the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes'). After transmitting stolen credentials to their C2 servers for credential access, FIN4 continues to use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain further access to their targets' Outlook credentials.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FIN4 first targets individuals with spearphishing emails to capture usernames and passwords (Reconnaissance). They then transmit these stolen credentials to their C2 servers (Command and Control). Afterward, they use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials (Initial Access) and label the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' (Resource Development). Therefore, the answer is Yes.
