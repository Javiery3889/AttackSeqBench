 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline: APT10 is observed using spear phishing emails to compromise targets, deploying malware for long-term remote access, performing internal reconnaissance, and using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.

2. Analyze the Question: The question mentions remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives, which aligns with the Execution phase in the CTI Outline where APT10 installs updates and new malware on compromised systems. The question then asks if APT10 will conduct internal reconnaissance, which is a tactic mentioned in the Discovery phase of the CTI Outline.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The question's sequence of TTPs (remote command execution, compression, and internal reconnaissance) aligns with the sequence in the CTI Outline (Execution, Discovery). The answer choice that best aligns with this sequence is "Yes".
