 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: APT28 uses a malicious Word document with the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system.
   - Execution: The document uses the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell, which downloads and runs encoded commands.
   - Defense Evasion: APT28 uses new techniques to bypass network defenses, such as the DDE technique.
   - Command and Control: The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the document leveraging the DDE technique via PowerShell to achieve execution by downloading and running encoded commands.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that the document uses the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell, which downloads and runs encoded commands.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence and contextual information is "Yes".
