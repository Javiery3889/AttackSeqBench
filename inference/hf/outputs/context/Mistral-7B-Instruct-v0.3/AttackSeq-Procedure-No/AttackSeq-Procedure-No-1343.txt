 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: AURORA PANDA uses exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organization's website.
   - Post-Exploitation: The ZxShell malware used in this attack contains Sakula malware as an unusual component.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access and the use of Sakula malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the ZxShell malware, which is a part of the AURORA PANDA attack, contains Sakula malware as an unusual component. This suggests that the Sakula malware is used after the initial access and ZxShell infection.

4. Conclusion:
   - The question asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code. Since the Sakula malware is part of the ZxShell malware used in the attack, it is likely that the Sakula malware will be used after the initial access and before leveraging the exploit code, making answer choice A the most plausible.
