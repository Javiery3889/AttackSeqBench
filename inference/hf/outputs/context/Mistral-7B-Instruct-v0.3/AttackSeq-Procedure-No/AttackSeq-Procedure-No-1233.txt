 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Deploy additional modules (pr.dll)
2. Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

From the CTI outline, we can see that Discovery (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) is one of the tactics employed by APT28. However, the question does not specify a time frame or sequence for the deployment of additional modules (pr.dll) and the Discovery tactic. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether APT28 performs Discovery after deploying additional modules.

The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform Discovery after deploying additional modules. Since the CTI outline does not provide information that suggests APT28 always performs Discovery after deploying additional modules, we cannot confirm that this is a likely sequence of events.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
