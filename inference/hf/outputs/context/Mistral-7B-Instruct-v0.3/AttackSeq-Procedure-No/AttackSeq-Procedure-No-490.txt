 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Resource Development: FamousSparrow exploited known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
   - Initial Access: FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - Execution: FamousSparrow utilized cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - Persistence: FamousSparrow created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex, and used DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
   - Defense Evasion: FamousSparrow injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files or information.
   - Discovery: SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files.
   - Collection: FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them.
   - Command and Control: SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - Exfiltration: FamousSparrow exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.
   - Privilege Escalation: No specific details provided.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that FamousSparrow used phishing emails to steal application access tokens before the Discovery phase. The tactics used by FamousSparrow, as outlined, do not include phishing emails or access token theft.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications, not by using phishing emails. They then collected system information and probed files as part of the Discovery phase. Therefore, it is not likely that they stole application access tokens via phishing emails before collecting system information and probing files.
   - Final Answer: B: No.
