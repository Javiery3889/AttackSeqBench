 To answer this question, we need to consider the Defense Evasion tactic mentioned in the CTI outline, where RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. However, the question specifically asks about domain fronting, which is a technique used to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same Content Delivery Network (CDN).

While RIG EK uses proxy servers, there is no direct evidence in the CTI outline that it uses domain fronting. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that it does use domain fronting for its command and control operations.

Final Answer: B: No. RIG EK's exploit server is not likely to use domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server hosted in the same CDN for its command and control operations.
