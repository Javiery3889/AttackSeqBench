 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing email with a VBScript encoded script that downloads and executes a PowerShell attack.
   - Execution: PowerShell commands download and execute .ps1 files containing base64 encoded code, which, when decoded, reveals the infection code for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
   - Command and Control: Malware communicates with a C2 server at 61.97.243.15.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing a connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the FHAPPI campaign uses PowerShell commands to download and execute .ps1 files, which contain base64 encoded code. This indicates the use of fileless techniques to avoid detection during the execution phase.
   - The question asks if this fileless technique would be used only after establishing a connection with the C2 server. In this case, the fileless technique (PowerShell commands) is used during the Execution phase, which precedes the Command and Control phase where the connection with the C2 server is established. Therefore, it is plausible that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques before establishing a connection with the C2 server.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Yes, it is likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing a connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.
