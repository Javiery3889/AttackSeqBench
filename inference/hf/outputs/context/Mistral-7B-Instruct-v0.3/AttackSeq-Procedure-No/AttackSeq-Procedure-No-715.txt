 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of Microsoft Office DDE protocol
   - Defense Evasion: Use of LotL tactics, publicly available hack tools, and deletion of tools from victim machines
   - Command and Control: Communication with infected devices using specific IP addresses and WinZip console for data archival
   - Exfiltration: Use of the legitimate WinZip console for data archival

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions the use of LotL tactics and the removal of tools from victim machines, which aligns with the Defense Evasion tactic in the CTI outline.
   - The question also mentions the potential use of WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks. However, there is no information in the CTI outline that suggests Gallmaker used this specific tool.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence that Gallmaker used WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks after the Initial Access phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gallmaker would use this tool, but the CTI outline does not support this likelihood.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence that Gallmaker used WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks after the Initial Access phase.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Gallmaker would use tools such as WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks only after initiating their attack by exploiting the Microsoft Office DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.

Final Answer: No.
