 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content, MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352, watering hole attacks with a PowerPoint document
   - Execution: Backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts
   - Credential Access: Backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials
   - Collection: File-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server
   - Command and Control: Backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, uses resilient communications

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it's likely that the Dropping Elephant threat actor will use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files before evading detection by decoding the encoded blobs.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server, which are encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts. However, there is no mention of steganography or PNG files.
   - The question asks about steganography and PNG files, but the CTI outline does not provide evidence to support the use of these techniques.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide evidence to suggest that the Dropping Elephant threat actor uses steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files before evading detection by decoding the encoded blobs.
   - Final Answer: No.
