 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Unknown
   - Execution: Deployment of Backdoor.Graphon, custom downloader, and custom screenshot tool.
   - Persistence: Custom downloader sets a registry value for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Leverages legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities and uses a decoy URL.
   - Collection: Custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots.
   - Exfiltration: Custom screenshot tool saves captured screenshots to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the C2 communication protocol used by Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the C2 communication protocol used by Backdoor.Graphon or Cobalt Strike Beacon. However, it does mention that Harvester group uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for command and control activities, suggesting they do not use FTP for C2 communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection, but the CTI outline does not provide information about the C2 communication protocol used by Backdoor.Graphon or Cobalt Strike Beacon. Since the Harvester group uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for command and control activities, it is unlikely that they would use FTP for C2 communication (Answer A). Therefore, the final answer is B: No.
