 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing email with a Flash exploit (flash_video_x86.swf) is used to gain initial access.
   - Persistence: If the Flash exploitation is successful, a first-stage backdoor malware is delivered, which ensures persistence on the machine through a scheduled task that runs with the highest privileges.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Sednit group will enable persistence on the victim's machine before utilizing an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Sednit group establishes persistence on the victim's machine after the successful delivery of the Flash exploit.
   - The question asks if the group will enable persistence before utilizing an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit. Since the persistence is established after the Flash exploit, it is likely that the group will enable persistence before utilizing the unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that the Sednit group will enable persistence on the victim's machine before utilizing an unpatched Windows local privilege escalation exploit.
