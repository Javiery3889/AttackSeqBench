 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - Execution: PowerShell scripts, batch file, syn.exe, 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - Persistence: Copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - Privilege Escalation: Creating a new administrator user and executing another instance of itself.
   - Discovery: System information, file and directory discovery, screen capture.
   - Command and Control: Communicates with a C2 server.
   - Exfiltration: Data over the C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about Deep Panda gaining persistence through the Milestone backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to gain persistence through the Milestone backdoor, which aligns with the persistence TTP mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that Deep Panda gains persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - Therefore, it is likely that Deep Panda will gain persistence through the Milestone backdoor by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
