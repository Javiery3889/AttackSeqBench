 To answer this question, we need to look for the Collection and Exfiltration tactics in the CTI outline. Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs were encrypted. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about whether Machete divides files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them. The outline only mentions that the collected data is encrypted and staged in a temporary folder for exfiltration.

Since the CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question, it is not possible to determine whether the answer is "Yes" or "No" with certainty.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
