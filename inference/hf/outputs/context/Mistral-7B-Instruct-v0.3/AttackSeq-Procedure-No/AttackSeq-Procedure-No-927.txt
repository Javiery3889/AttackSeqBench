 Final Answer: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Emissary Panda identified vulnerable systems and gathered information.
   - Initial Access: They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells.
   - Execution: They uploaded tools, including HyperBro, for post-exploitation.
   - Persistence: They installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: They used webshells and DLL sideloading to evade defenses.
   - Credential Access: They used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - Discovery: They performed network reconnaissance.
   - Lateral Movement: They moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after Emissary Panda used the HyperBro backdoor to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Emissary Panda moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144, after they installed webshells for persistence. However, the question does not mention the installation of webshells for persistence before lateral movement and the use of the EternalBlue exploit.

4. Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question does not align with the attack sequence in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is not likely that Emissary Panda performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and the EternalBlue exploit before exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to install webshells for persistence. The correct answer is "No".
