 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The malware was distributed via spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that downloaded a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site.
   - Privilege Escalation: The malware used a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware utilized a UAC bypass module to prevent the UAC pop-up from appearing when files were moved to the System32 folder.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process only after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware downloads a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document, and then uses a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges. The question asks if it is likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process after downloading the CAB file. Although the CTI outline does not explicitly mention batch files, the UAC bypass module's execution process involves creating a wusa.exe process and running cmd.exe with elevated privileges, which can be considered a multi-step process using batch files.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware first downloads a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document (Initial Access). Then, it uses a UAC bypass module to execute the main payload with elevated privileges, which involves creating a wusa.exe process and running cmd.exe with elevated privileges (Privilege Escalation). Although the CTI outline does not explicitly mention batch files, the UAC bypass module's execution process can be considered a multi-step process using batch files. Therefore, it is likely that the malware infection method will use batch files in a multi-step process only after downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site through a script embedded in a malicious document (Answer: Yes).
