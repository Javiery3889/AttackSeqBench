 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Stolen credentials and SSH tools
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through scripts, PowerShell, and custom VM-based payload loader
   - Defense Evasion: Process injection and deobfuscation
   - Discovery: Process, system information, system time, and network service scanning
   - Collection: Data archiving using a custom storage file format
   - Command and Control: Communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, SSL-encrypted, capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies, and RSA encryption for AES key exchange

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the CostaRicto Campaign communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which is a C2 protocol. The data is SSL-encrypted, and there is no mention of exfiltration over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign communicates with C2 servers using a secure, encrypted protocol (DNS and HTTP). There is no evidence in the CTI outline that suggests the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrates data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
