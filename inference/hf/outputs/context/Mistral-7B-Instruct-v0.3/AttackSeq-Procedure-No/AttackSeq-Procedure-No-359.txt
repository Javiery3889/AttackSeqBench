 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The malware (SunBird and Hornbill) collects data, stores it in SQLite databases, compresses it into ZIP files, and stores it in hidden folders on external storage.
   - SunBird uploads data to C2 servers at regular intervals, while Hornbill only uploads when data changes.
   - The C2 infrastructure was insecurely configured, exposing over 18GB of exfiltrated data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SunBird and Hornbill will exfiltrate data over C2 channels only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that SunBird and Hornbill collect data, store it locally, and then upload it to C2 servers. The question asks if they will exfiltrate data only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the data. Since the C2 servers are used to store the data (as seen in the CTI outline), it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate the data over C2 channels only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the data.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Yes. The malware will exfiltrate data over C2 channels only after the C2 infrastructure is utilized to store or expose the exfiltrated data.
