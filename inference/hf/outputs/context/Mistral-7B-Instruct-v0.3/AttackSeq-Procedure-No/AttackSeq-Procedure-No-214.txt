 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - Execution: PowerShell scripts, batch file, syn.exe, 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - Persistence: Copying 1.dll to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating msupdate2 service in the registry.
   - Privilege Escalation: Creating a new administrator user, executing another instance of the backdoor, and removing the user.
   - Discovery: System information discovery, file and directory discovery, screen capture.
   - Command and Control: Communication with C2 server, sending information about current sessions.
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about Deep Panda installing a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. The Milestone backdoor's persistence and other functionalities are detailed, but there is no mention of certificate installation.

4. Final Answer: Based on the provided CTI outline, Deep Panda is not likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities (Answer Choice B).
