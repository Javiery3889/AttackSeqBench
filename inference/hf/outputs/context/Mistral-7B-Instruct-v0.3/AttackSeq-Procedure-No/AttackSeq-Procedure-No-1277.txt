 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events in the CTI outline. The initial access and execution steps involve DLL Side-Loading and the injection of a shellcode into svchost.exe, but there is no mention of the Run registry key being used for persistence. Therefore, it is not likely that APT10 would inject the decrypted shellcode into svchost.exe for execution only after setting persistence using the Run registry key.

Final Answer: B: No.
