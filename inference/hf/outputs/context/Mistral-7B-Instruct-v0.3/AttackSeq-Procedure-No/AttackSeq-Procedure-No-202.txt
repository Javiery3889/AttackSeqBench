 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the Question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attackers use spearphishing emails to initially compromise victims (Initial Access - Tactic 0001).
   - After initial access, they use tools like SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement (Lateral Movement - Tactic 0008). They do not use Nmap or Mimikatz for this purpose.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the attackers will use spearphishing to initially compromise victims before mapping the network and collecting passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers use spearphishing for initial access, but they do not use it for network mapping or password collection. Instead, they use lateral movement tools.
   - The question asks if the attackers will use spearphishing for network mapping and password collection, which is not indicated in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers use spearphishing for initial access, but not for network mapping or password collection.
   - The question asks if they will use spearphishing for network mapping and password collection, which is not supported by the CTI outline.
   - Therefore, the answer is "No".

Final Answer: No.
