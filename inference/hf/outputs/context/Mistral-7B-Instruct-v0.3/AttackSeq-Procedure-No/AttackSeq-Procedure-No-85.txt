 To answer this question, we need to find out if Vyveva's backdoor collects system information before or after compressing files for transmission.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Vyveva's backdoor can obtain system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, architecture, and the local IP address (T1082, T1016, T1124). However, there is no direct mention of it collecting files after obtaining system information.

The Discovery tactic (T1082, T1016, T1124, T1083, T1057) is about gathering information about the system, not about file collection. The Exfiltration tactic (T1041) is about sending data to the C&C server, but there's no mention of it being conditional on system information collection.

The Compressing Files for Transmission tactic is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that since Vyveva's backdoor communicates with the C&C server (T1573.001, T1573.002, T1041), it likely compresses files for efficient transmission.

Given this information, it's not clear from the CTI outline that Vyveva's backdoor collects files from the computer only after obtaining system information. Therefore, the answer is not necessarily "Yes" or "No".

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
