 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is: Initial Access (not mentioned), Defense Evasion (AtomBombing).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions AtomBombing and the use of a VBA script embedded within a malicious Word document.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions AtomBombing, a technique for code injection into trusted processes. However, it does not mention the use of VBA scripts or Word documents.
   - The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use a VBA script after using AtomBombing. While AtomBombing can be used to execute malicious code via legitimate programs, it does not specify the type of code or the method of delivery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide enough information to definitively say whether threat actors will use a VBA script after AtomBombing. AtomBombing is a technique for code injection, and the type of code and delivery method (such as a Word document) are not specified.
   - Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether the answer choice A: "Yes" or B: "No" is correct based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the question.

Final Answer: Insufficient information to determine the answer.
