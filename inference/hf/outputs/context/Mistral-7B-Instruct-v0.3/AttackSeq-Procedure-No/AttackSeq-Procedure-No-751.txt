 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of events in the CTI outline and the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests (Command and Control tactic) before it ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder (Persistence tactic).

The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will fetch computer name and user name information as part of its discovery activities only after ensuring persistence. Since the CTI outline does not provide specific information about the Rising Sun implant fetching computer name and user name information, we cannot definitively answer this question based on the provided information. However, based on the sequence of events, it is possible that the implant could perform discovery activities after ensuring persistence, but we cannot confirm this with certainty.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
