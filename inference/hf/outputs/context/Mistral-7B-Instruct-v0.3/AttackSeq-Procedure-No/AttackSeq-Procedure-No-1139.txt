 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The 'Recon' module group is used to gather initial system information and determine subsequent actions.
   - The 'Spreading' module group is used to scan for other hosts on the network, fingerprint them, and then infect them via MS08-067 or a list of stolen admin credentials.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the 'Spreading' module group will attempt to infect other hosts on the network before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The 'Recon' module group's primary function is to collect information about the target system and determine which other modules should be deployed next. The 'Spreading' module group is one of the modules that could be deployed next, as it is used to infect other hosts on the network.
   - The 'Password' module group is not mentioned in the sequence of events following the 'Recon' module group.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided, it is likely that the 'Spreading' module group will attempt to infect other hosts on the network before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
