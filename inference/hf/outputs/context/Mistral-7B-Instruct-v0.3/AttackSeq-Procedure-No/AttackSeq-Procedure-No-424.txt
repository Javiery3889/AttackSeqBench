 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with Word documents containing macros.
   - Initial Access: Phishing emails with a Microsoft Word document containing VBS macros.
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding disk writes.
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads.
   - Impact: Payloads downloaded and executed are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we see that the PowerShell script downloads payloads (GandCrab and Ursnif) from C2 servers. The script uses the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk. While the question does not explicitly mention the COM object executing queries to gather system information, the PowerShell script's ability to download and execute payloads suggests that it could potentially perform additional actions such as system information gathering.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The PowerShell script, which is part of the attack sequence, downloads payloads and executes them without saving them to disk using a DCOM object. Although the question does not explicitly state that the COM object gathers system information, the PowerShell script's capabilities suggest that it could potentially perform such actions. Therefore, it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Final Answer: A: Yes.
