 Final Answer: B: No

Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Reconnaissance
     - Initial Access (Deliver Remote Access Trojan)
     - Credential Access (Harvest Credentials)
     - Discovery (Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network, Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network)
     - Command and Control (Establish CC Connection)
     - Impact (Develop Malicious Computer Code, Deliver Data Destruction Malware, Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption, Trip Breakers, Sever Connection to Field Devices, Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack, Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage, Destroy Critical System Data)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 and employee-enabled macro execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, BlackEnergy 3 is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution in the Initial Access phase. However, there is no mention of Ruby scripts being used to execute payloads after installation.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not include the use of Ruby scripts to execute payloads after BlackEnergy 3 is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution. Therefore, the answer is B: No.
