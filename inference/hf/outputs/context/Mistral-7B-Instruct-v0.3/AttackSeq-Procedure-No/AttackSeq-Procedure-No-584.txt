 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics and techniques used by FIN8 in the provided CTI outline. The tactics of interest are Lateral Movement and Command and Control (C2).

In the CTI outline, we can see that FIN8 uses wmic.exe to move laterally to the Domain Controller and execute the BADHATCH deployment script. However, there is no mention of enumerating AWS storage services such as S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes, or performing domain trust discovery with tools like nltest.exe and ping.exe.

Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers will enumerate AWS storage services before performing domain trust discovery.

Final Answer: No.
