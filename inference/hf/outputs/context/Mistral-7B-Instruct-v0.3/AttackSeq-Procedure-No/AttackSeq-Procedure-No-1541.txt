 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing campaign delivering malware disguised as a Curriculum Vitae.
   - Initial Malware Communication: POST request to the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info only after the malware samples proceed to use other identified C2 domains.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the initial malware communicates with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info immediately after the initial access, without any mention of using other C2 domains.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial malware communicates with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info as soon as it is executed, without any indication of using other C2 domains first. Therefore, the malware will communicate with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info before or at the same time as it uses other C2 domains (if it does).
   - Final Answer: No. The initial malware sample will communicate with the C2 domain judystevenson[.]info without waiting for the malware samples to proceed to use other identified C2 domains.
