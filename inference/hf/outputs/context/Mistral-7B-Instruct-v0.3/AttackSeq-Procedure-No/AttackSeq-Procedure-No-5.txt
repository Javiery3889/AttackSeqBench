 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Patchwork targeted US-based think tanks and used unique tracking links in their emails to identify which recipients opened their emails.
   - Initial Access: Patchwork used spear phishing campaigns with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
   - Persistence: QuasarRAT creates a scheduled task that points to the malware binary, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.
   - Command and Control: QuasarRAT beacons over an encrypted connection to the command and control domain after being executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Patchwork initially delivers QuasarRAT through RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 in spear phishing campaigns. This aligns with the question's requirement of receiving spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.
   - The question does not mention any specific sequence of events after the initial infection with QuasarRAT, but the CTI Outline does not suggest any other method of delivering RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 after the initial infection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI Outline shows that Patchwork initially delivers QuasarRAT through RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 in spear phishing campaigns. After recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report, it is likely that they will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT (Answer Choice A).
