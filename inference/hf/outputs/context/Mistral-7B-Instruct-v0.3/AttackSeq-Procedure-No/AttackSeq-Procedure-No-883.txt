 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Weaponized RTF file, archive files, direct delivery
   - Execution: Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - Persistence: Established through 'Startup' folder, 'Run' registry key, and injecting into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - Defense Evasion: Operating C&C servers in limited time windows, fileless loading techniques, and changing server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - Collection: Aria-body backdoor gathers various types of information.
   - Command and Control: Uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Naikon APT group utilized HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the Naikon APT group indeed uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication (Command and Control tactic) and later uses the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes (Collection tactic).
   - The question does not specify the discovery phase, but since the C&C communication and the collection of information about active processes are sequential events in the attack sequence, it is likely that the Naikon APT group utilized HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Naikon APT group uses HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication (Command and Control tactic) and later uses the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes (Collection tactic). Since these events are sequential, it is likely that the Naikon APT group utilized HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
