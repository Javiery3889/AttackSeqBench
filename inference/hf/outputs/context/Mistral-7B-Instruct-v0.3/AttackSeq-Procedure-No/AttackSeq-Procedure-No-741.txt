 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: TA505 exploited the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access.
   - Execution: TA505 utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software.
   - Persistence: TA505 attempted to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task and altering it to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.
   - Defense Evasion: TA505 stored the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.
   - MITRE ATT&CK mapping: TA505's activities include T1190 for Initial Access, T1059.001 for Execution, T1053.005 for Persistence, and T1112 for Defense Evasion.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if TA505 will execute Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands only after gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that TA505 indeed utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to execute Cobalt Strike Beacon after gaining initial access through the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - TA505 gained initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - After gaining initial access, TA505 utilized Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on the compromised systems.
   - Therefore, it is likely that TA505 will execute Cobalt Strike Beacon on the compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands only after gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
