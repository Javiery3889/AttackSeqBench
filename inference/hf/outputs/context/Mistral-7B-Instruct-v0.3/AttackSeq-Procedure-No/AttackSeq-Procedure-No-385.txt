 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors, including RoyalCLI, which bypasses command prompt policy settings.
   - Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions APT15 deploying backdoors and using RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that APT15 used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings and also used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. The question asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials, which aligns with the information in the CTI outline.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the question, it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
