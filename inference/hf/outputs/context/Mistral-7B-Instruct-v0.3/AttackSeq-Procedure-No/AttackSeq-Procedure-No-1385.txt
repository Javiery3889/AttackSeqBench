 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE
2. Exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access
3. Establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE.
2. Persistence: FIN13 establishes persistence using various methods, including SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

From this comparison, we can see that the sequence in the question aligns with the Initial Access and Persistence stages in the CTI outline. The question asks if FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence. Based on the CTI outline, this is plausible as FIN13 first establishes a foothold through Initial Access (exploiting external servers) and then sets up persistence using various methods, including SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Final Answer: A: Yes
