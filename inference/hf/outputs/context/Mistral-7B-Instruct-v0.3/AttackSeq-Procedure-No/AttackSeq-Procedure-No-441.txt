 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: Waterbear uses a DLL loader to execute an RC4-encrypted payload, which can receive and load additional executables. The payload is injected into an existing Windows Service.
   - Defense Evasion: Waterbear employs API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection after the backdoor configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Waterbear uses API hooking techniques for defense evasion, and the question asks if this technique will be used after a specific configuration change. Given that the attacker's modus operandi (MO) is to use API hooking for evasion, it is likely that they will continue to use this technique even after the configuration change.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: A: Yes, it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory.
