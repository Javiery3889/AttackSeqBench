 To answer this question, we need to analyze the CTI outline and the question to identify the TTPs related to data exfiltration.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Yellow Garuda's Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts and stores the exfiltrated data within a SQLite database and also in JSON format. However, there is no information in the CTI outline that suggests these data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

A: Yes
B: No

Comparing the answer choices with the information from the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include dividing the data into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrating them to evade detection. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
