 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Stolen credentials, SSH tools, remote tunneling, malicious domains, proxy, local port, SSH tools authentication using private keys, scheduled tasks, payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS), PowerShell loader, Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module, scripts, encrypted files, 64-bit backdoor, 32-bit backdoor, custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).
   - Execution: Malicious code execution through various methods, 64-bit backdoor deployment, PowerShell loader, Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module, 32-bit backdoor custom VM-based payload loader, decoding and injecting payload into memory.
   - Defense Evasion: Process injection, deobfuscation, Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.
   - Discovery: SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, system time discovery, network service scanning (pscan and nmap).
   - Collection: Custom storage file format for archiving collected data.
   - Exfiltration: Data exfiltration over the C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the SombRAT backdoor has capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and network service scanning. These capabilities are part of the Discovery phase as defined by the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor has the capability to perform process discovery and system information discovery, as these are part of the Discovery phase mentioned in the CTI outline. Therefore, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
