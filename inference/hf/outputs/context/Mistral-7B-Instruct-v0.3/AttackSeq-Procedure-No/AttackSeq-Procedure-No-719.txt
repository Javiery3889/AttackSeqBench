 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with infected document files
   - Execution: Multi-stage infection framework with anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques
   - Persistence: Scheduled tasks and registry key creation

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question mentions a multi-stage infection framework with anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques during execution, and persistence through scheduled tasks and registry key creation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the CopyKittens group initially gained access through spear phishing emails with infected document files, then employed a multi-stage infection framework with anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques during execution. Afterward, they ensured persistence through scheduled tasks and registry key creation.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the CopyKittens group will utilize spear phishing emails with infected document files to achieve initial access only after ensuring persistence through scheduled tasks and registry key creation.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes. The CopyKittens group will likely utilize spear phishing emails with infected document files to achieve initial access only after ensuring persistence through scheduled tasks and registry key creation.
