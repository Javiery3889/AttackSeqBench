 To answer this question, we need to determine if the 'show.swf' Flash file, which is the payload executed after the initial access, contains any TTPs related to downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the attack involves a spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to gain initial access, followed by the execution of the 'show.swf' Flash file. However, there is no mention of any TTPs related to downgrading NTLM or capturing NTLM hashes in the attack sequence or the description of the 'show.swf' file.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not likely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

Final Answer: B: No.
