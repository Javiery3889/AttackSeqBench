 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Packrat uses phishing attacks and fake news organizations for Initial Access. However, there is no direct evidence that they clear logs after gaining initial access or before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques.

The Execution phase of the attack includes the use of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques, but there is no mention of log cleaning during this phase.

Given the lack of evidence in the CTI outline, it is not possible to definitively say whether Packrat clears logs before or after employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
