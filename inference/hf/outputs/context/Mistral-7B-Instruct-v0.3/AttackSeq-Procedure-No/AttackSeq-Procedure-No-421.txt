 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - Execution: VBS macro execution, PowerShell script download and execution of Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding disk writes.
   - Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads.
   - Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware execution.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly indicates that the campaign involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros (Reconnaissance). The execution of the VBS macro is the first step in the attack sequence (Execution). Therefore, it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attack sequence starts with phishing emails containing malicious Word documents (Reconnaissance), which leads to the execution of VBS macros (Execution). Since the question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file, the answer is "Yes".
