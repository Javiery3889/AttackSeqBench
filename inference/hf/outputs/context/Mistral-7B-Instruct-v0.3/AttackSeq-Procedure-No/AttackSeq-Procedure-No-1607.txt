 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Reconnaissance: SideCopy uses decoys, honeytraps, and cloned websites to target government personnel in India, with a focus on Kavach.
   - Resource Development: SideCopy mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and uses phishing portals to trick victims into divulging their credentials.
   - Initial Access: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables, and MSI-based installers as entry points.
   - Execution: SideCopy deploys RATs, plugins, and malware post-infection.
   - Persistence: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: SideCopy employs tactics to avoid detection, such as using decoy documents, mimicking legitimate processes, and cloning websites.
   - Discovery: SideCopy uses themes to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent and lures victims in with honeytraps.
   - Collection: SideCopy utilizes modular plugins for specific malicious tasks, including credential harvesting and keylogging.
   - Command and Control: SideCopy delivers malicious artifacts through fake or compromised websites.
   - Exfiltration: SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline shows that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their Initial Access tactic. This means that they execute these infection chains after establishing initial access to victim systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their Initial Access tactic (CTI Outline). This means that they execute these infection chains after establishing initial access to victim systems. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
