 To answer this question, we need to determine if Vyveva's backdoor collects files from newly inserted removable media and notifies the C&C server only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.

From the CTI outline, we can see that Vyveva's backdoor has the capability to exfiltrate data (T1041) and gather system information such as the local IP address (T1016) and system time (T1124) under the Discovery tactic. However, there is no information in the CTI outline that suggests Vyveva collects files from newly inserted removable media and notifies the C&C server only after obtaining the local IP address and system time.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the TTPs related to the question: Collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time.
2. Check the CTI outline for these TTPs: There is no explicit mention of collecting files from newly inserted removable media or notifying the C&C only after obtaining the local IP address and system time.
3. Based on the available information, it is not plausible to conclude that Vyveva's backdoor collects files from newly inserted removable media and notifies the C&C only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time.

Final Answer: No.
