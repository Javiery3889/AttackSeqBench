 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Phishing attacks through email and social media accounts
   - Defense Evasion: Use of images, third-party services, and hidden tracking images
   - Credential Access: Phishing pages for Google and Yahoo! mail services, real-time verification, and bypassing 2-factor authentication
   - Persistence: No password changes, allowing for real-time monitoring
   - Others: No evidence of IP address scanning or tailoring targeting approach

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the Iranian state-backed hackers scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any evidence of IP address scanning or tailoring the targeting approach.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attackers used phishing emails and social media accounts to gain initial access, not by scanning specific IP addresses.
   - The attackers used images, third-party services, and hidden tracking images to evade detection, but there is no mention of IP address scanning.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that they scanned specific lists of target IP addresses to tailor their targeting approach (Final Answer: B: No).
