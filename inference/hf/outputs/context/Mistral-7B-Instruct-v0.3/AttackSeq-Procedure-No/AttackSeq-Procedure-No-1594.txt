 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Rocket Kitten uses malware to execute attacks, installs a keylogger, and gains access to victims' emails and other accounts.
   - Persistence: Rocket Kitten repeatedly attempts to attack the same targets and takes over accounts immediately after obtaining passwords.
   - Defense Evasion: Rocket Kitten uses various techniques to evade detection, but there's no mention of them stopping after gaining initial access.
   - Credential Access: Rocket Kitten steals credentials and gains access to additional accounts.
   - Command and Control: Rocket Kitten communicates with a C&C server to download malware and monitor victims.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it's likely that Rocket Kitten will attempt to acquire valid credentials for victim environments to establish initial access on target machines.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Rocket Kitten gains access to victims' accounts (email, Facebook, other email accounts, and cloud accounts) after obtaining credentials through social engineering and spear phishing. This aligns with the question's requirement of acquiring valid credentials for victim environments.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Rocket Kitten has been shown to gain access to victims' accounts after obtaining credentials. Since the question asks if they are likely to attempt this action, it is reasonable to conclude that they will continue to do so. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
