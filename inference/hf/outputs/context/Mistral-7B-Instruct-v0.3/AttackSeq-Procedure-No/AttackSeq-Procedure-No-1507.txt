 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Deliver exploits through malvertising
2. Redirect users to advertising pages or compromised websites
3. Run an obfuscated PowerShell script
4. Fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
2. Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines, which are slightly modified versions of publicly available exploits, usually obfuscated.
3. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature.
4. Command and Control: RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server. The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS.

From the CTI outline, we can see that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising (Initial Access) and uses obfuscated exploits (Resource Development). However, there is no direct mention of running a PowerShell script or using the Command and Scripting Interpreter to fetch malware.

Therefore, the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question does not form a plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: No.
