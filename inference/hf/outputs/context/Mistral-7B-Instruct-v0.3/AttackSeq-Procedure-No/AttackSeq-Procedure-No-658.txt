 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) mentioned in the CTI outline and the question.

From the CTI outline, we can see that the actors used the AntSword webshell for command and control and running commands on the compromised server. However, there is no direct evidence that they downloaded a new plugin for a remote VNC session or used webshells for lateral movement to other systems.

The question asks if it's likely that the actors started a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin before using webshells for lateral movement to other systems. Since there is no evidence in the CTI outline to support this, the most plausible answer would be:

Final Answer: No.

It's important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The threat actors might have used other methods for remote VNC sessions or lateral movement that are not mentioned in the provided CTI outline. This answer is based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the question. If more information were available, a different answer might be more appropriate.
