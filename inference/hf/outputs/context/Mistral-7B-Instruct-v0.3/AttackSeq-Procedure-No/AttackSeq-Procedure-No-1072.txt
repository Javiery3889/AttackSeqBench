 To answer this question, we need to understand the sequence of TTPs (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) used by Tropic Trooper and whether TClient, a component associated with Tropic Trooper, uses email for C2 via an Office macro during the Command and Control (C2) phase.

From the CTI outline, we can identify the following sequence of TTPs:
1. Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain access to the system.
2. Execution: Downloading and installing an installer package (.msi), dropping and executing malicious files, and using BITSadmin and DLL hijacking to launch the malware.
3. Persistence: The backdoor connects to command-and-control (C&C) servers using SSL protocol.
4. Defense Evasion: DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection and creating hidden directories as a ruse.

The question asks about the Command and Control (C2) phase, but it does not mention the use of email or Office macros in the CTI outline. However, it is mentioned that Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware to targets. This suggests that they might use Office documents as a vector for initial access, but it does not necessarily mean they use Office macros for C2.

TClient, a component of Tropic Trooper, is known to use custom SSL libraries to connect to C&C servers, not email or Office macros. Therefore, it is unlikely that TClient will use email for C2 via an Office macro during the Command and Control phase.

Final Answer: No.
