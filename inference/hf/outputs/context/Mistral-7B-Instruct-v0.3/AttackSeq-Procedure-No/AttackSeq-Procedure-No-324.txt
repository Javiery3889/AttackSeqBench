 To answer this question, let's first analyze the CTI outline and the question:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (malware) installed on compromised systems.
   - Execution: Malware runs in the background, hides its icon, and restarts if terminated (except on iOS 8).
   - Discovery: Malware collects various types of information from the iOS device.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the Command and Control phase or any TTPs related to FTP.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to FTP, so we cannot definitively say whether the malware will initiate download via FTP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline provides details about Initial Access, Execution, and Discovery phases but does not mention the Command and Control phase or any TTPs related to FTP.
   - Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the malware will initiate download via FTP based on the provided information.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the given information.
