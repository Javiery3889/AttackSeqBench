 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans, zero-day vulnerabilities, and detailed system fingerprinting to compromise targets.
   - Defense Evasion: Longhorn employs tactics like wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols to avoid detection.
   - Collection: Longhorn's malware has capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - Command and Control: Longhorn communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - Exfiltration: Longhorn communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Longhorn is likely to use its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Longhorn performs detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase, which aligns with the system information discovery part of the question.
   - The defense evasion tactics mentioned in the question (wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation) are also tactics used by Longhorn, as stated in the CTI outline.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that Longhorn would use its malware for system information discovery only after employing defense evasion tactics.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Longhorn performs detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase (CTI Outline).
   - Longhorn employs tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion (CTI Outline).
   - Therefore, it is likely that Longhorn uses its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion (Question).
   - Final Answer: Yes.
