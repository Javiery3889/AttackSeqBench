 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. Sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets
2. Moving laterally by using compromised personal email accounts to access corporate accounts
3. Conducting internal reconnaissance by accessing the user’s contacts and extracting system and network information

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Reconnaissance: APT42 gathers information about targets (government officials, former Iranian policymakers, etc.)
2. Initial Access: APT42 performs initial compromises using spear phishing
3. Resource Development: APT42 carries out espionage and surveillance activity
4. Initial Access: APT42 bypasses MFA and intercepts SMS-based one-time passwords
5. Execution: APT42 establishes a foothold in victim environments
6. Persistence: APT42 maintains their presence in a victim's environment
7. Privilege Escalation: APT42 performs privilege escalation in a victim environment
8. Defense Evasion: APT42 employs techniques to avoid detection
9. Credential Access: APT42 steals credentials
10. Discovery: APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance
11. Collection: APT42 collects data of interest
12. Command and Control: APT42 uses application layer protocols, web services, and encrypted channels for command and control communications
13. Exfiltration: APT42 exfiltrates data

From the CTI outline, we can see that APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance (Discovery) before moving laterally (Persistence and Privilege Escalation). However, the question does not specify the order of moving laterally and conducting internal reconnaissance.

Given that the question asks about accessing the user’s contacts and extracting system and network information (Discovery) after sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets (Initial Access), it seems plausible that APT42 would conduct internal reconnaissance before moving laterally.

Final Answer: A: Yes
