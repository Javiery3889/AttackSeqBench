 To answer this question, let's first identify the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question:
1. InfoOS module gathers system information
2. XAgent component communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) server
3. Sends a hello message
4. Receives commands via the HTTPChannel module

Now, let's compare this sequence with the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
1. Initial Access (Komplex Trojan)
2. Execution (Initialization of XAgent's BootXLoader)
3. Persistence (Komplex Dropper ensures persistence, XAgent's Launcher re-executes itself)
4. Defense Evasion (XAgent checks for debugger presence)
5. Credential Access (XAgent's Password module obtains passwords)
6. Collection (XAgent's FileSystem module manages files, CameraShot module suggests intention to capture images)
7. Command and Control (Communication process between XAgent and C&C servers, HTTPChannel module used for communication)
8. Exfiltration (Data encrypted and sent to C&C server)

From the CTI outline, we can see that the Command and Control (C&C) communication and the sending of a hello message are part of the Command and Control (C2) phase. However, the InfoOS module's system information gathering is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

Since the question does not specify that the InfoOS module has already performed its task, it is not guaranteed that the XAgent component will communicate with its C&C server only after sending a hello message. The InfoOS module's system information gathering could occur before or after the C2 communication.

Therefore, the answer is not straightforward based on the provided information. However, if we make an assumption that the InfoOS module's system information gathering is a prerequisite for the C2 communication, then the sequence in the question could be plausible. But without explicit information linking the InfoOS module's system information gathering to the C2 communication, we cannot definitively say that the XAgent component will communicate with its C&C server only after sending a hello message.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined with the provided information.
