 To answer this question, we need to determine if ShadowPad configures Systemd to maintain persistence of another malware named GOGETTER. According to the CTI outline, ShadowPad creates a new service for extended access and injects the decrypted ShadowPad payload into a child process of the service process that is specified in the ShadowPad configuration information. However, there is no mention of ShadowPad configuring Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER or any other malware. Therefore, it is unlikely that ShadowPad configures Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER.

Final Answer: B: No
