 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics and techniques used in the spear phishing campaign described in the CTI outline. The attack started with a malicious document sent via email (Spear Phishing Attachment), which then executed a macro to download the first payload (Initial Access). The first payload then downloaded the Crimson RAT from a specific IP address (Command and Control).

However, there is no information in the CTI outline suggesting the use of social media channels to deliver the initial malicious document. Therefore, it is not likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.

Final Answer: No.
