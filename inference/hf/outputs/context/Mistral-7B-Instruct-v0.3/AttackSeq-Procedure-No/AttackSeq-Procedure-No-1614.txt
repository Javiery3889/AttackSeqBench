 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: The attack is linked to Cosmic Banker, which targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions and is linked to another campaign targeting users from Brazil's banking institutions.
   - Initial Access: The attack begins with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria (SAT), warning of a pending tax return. The email includes a malicious attachment that triggers the attack when clicked.
   - Execution: The malicious attachment contains a batch programming script that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level. The script downloads the main malware library DLL and other services.
   - Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
   - Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
   - Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials and access Outlook info to collect email accounts from the contacts list.
   - Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
   - Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download the malware and send collected data.
   - Others: Additional malware was found in a private source, but there is no mention of the collected email accounts being exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request, but there is no mention of FTP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware collects email accounts from Outlook contacts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request, but there is no mention of FTP. Therefore, the collected email accounts will not be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. Final Answer: B: No.
