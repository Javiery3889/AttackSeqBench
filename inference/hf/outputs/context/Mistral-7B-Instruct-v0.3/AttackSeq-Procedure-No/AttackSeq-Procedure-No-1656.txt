 Final Answer: B: No

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline: The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. The malware, when executed, downloaded a .doc file and opened it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy. No mention was made of the malware installing itself as a cron job using the cron utility.

2. Analyze the Question: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job after the initial sequence of events.

3. Compare and Evaluate: The initial sequence of events in the CTI outline does not include the installation of the malware as a cron job. The malware, after being downloaded and executed, leads to the execution of PowerShell to infect the system with Poison Ivy. Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job.

4. Conclusion: The final answer is B: No. The malware is more likely to use PowerShell for further execution, as seen in the CTI outline, rather than installing itself as a cron job.
