 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Execution: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges. It executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
   - Persistence: Infamous Chisel persists on the system by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path /system/bin/netd.
   - Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - Defense Evasion: Infamous Chisel's blob decompresses executables from bzip archives. The malware checks that it is executed by init and at the path for the legitimate netd, impairing defenses by ensuring it is run as intended.
   - Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information.
   - Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates multiple data directories to discover files of interest, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers various system information such as the Android ID and other hardware information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network to discover other devices.
   - Collection: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions. It also collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - Exfiltration: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - Impact: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd, potentially impacting the service.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to perform discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that Infamous Chisel's netd component indeed performs discovery activities such as enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The netd component of Infamous Chisel is responsible for discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network. Therefore, it is likely that Infamous Chisel will perform these discovery activities.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
