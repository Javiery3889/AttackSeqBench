 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: The attack uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro to gain initial access.
   - Execution: The macro triggers the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - Persistence: The PowerShell script drops components like invoker.ps1 for persistence.
   - Command and Control: The dropped component (PRB-Backdoor) communicates with the C&C server for further commands.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence after employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the PowerShell script (which is decoded) drops the invoker.ps1 component for persistence. This aligns with the question's description.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline includes Initial Access (embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document), Execution (triggering the scripts through macro-events), Persistence (dropping invoker.ps1 using decoded scripts), and Command and Control (PRB-Backdoor communicating with the C&C server).
   - The question asks if the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence. The CTI outline shows that this is indeed the case, so the answer is "Yes".
