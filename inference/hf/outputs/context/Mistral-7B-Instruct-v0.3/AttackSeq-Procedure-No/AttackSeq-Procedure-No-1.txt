 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
   - Execution: RasTls.dll checks for debuggers, hashes process names, and drops batch files to delete the initial malware file and winword.exe.
   - Persistence: Malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable.
   - Defense Evasion: Malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including checking for debuggers, process name hashing, process injection, timestomping, and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable.
   - Command and Control: Malware communicates with external C2 IP addresses on port 443 and references internal IP addresses.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the malware will achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion after it queries the registry and identifies victim machines as part of its discovery process.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the malware indeed achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable. The question's description of the malware's actions aligns with the persistence and defense evasion tactics mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The malware, after identifying victim machines as part of its discovery process, will likely achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - Final Answer: Yes.
