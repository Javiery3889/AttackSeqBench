 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with malicious attachments (disguised as documents)
   - Execution: Malware execution from disguised documents (e.g., 'IDF strikes militants in Gaza Strip following rocket barrage.doc.scr')
   - Command and Control: Communication with C&C structures hosted on DynDNS services
   - Others: Use of untrusted and faked digital signatures, document metadata revealing usernames associated with the attackers

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the sequence of TTPs where the attackers use untrusted and faked digital signatures after command-and-control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the attackers use untrusted and faked digital signatures (Command and Control phase) to disguise the malware files as legitimate documents (Execution phase).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attackers first disguise the malware files as legitimate documents (Execution phase) and then use untrusted and faked digital signatures to make the malware appear legitimate (Command and Control phase). Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
