 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs used by the Lazarus Group in the provided CTI outline.

1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used system utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe for reconnaissance, but there's no mention of using nltest.exe for Active Directory trust enumeration at this stage.

2. Initial Access: The attackers used malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email to gain initial access.

3. Execution: The attackers executed malicious code using system utilities, a backdoor named CommsCacher, and the Windows command line. They also leveraged the SQLite DLL library with a malicious exported function.

4. Persistence: The attackers created services using sc.exe and local administrator accounts, and placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.

5. Privilege Escalation: The attackers escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.

6. Defense Evasion: The group used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files with the VEST algorithm, hiding malware in hidden folders at C:\ProgramData, and removing malware samples from the file system. They also used rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL.

7. Lateral Movement: The group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with the C2 servers.

8. Command and Control: The Lazarus Group's malware used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to the C2 servers.

In the question, we are asked whether it's likely that the Lazarus Group will enumerate Active Directory trusts using nltest.exe before moving laterally within the network. However, there's no mention of the Lazarus Group using nltest.exe in the provided CTI outline. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively say whether they will or will not use this tool.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
