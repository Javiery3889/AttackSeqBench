 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks are used for gathering information and compromising victims.
   - Initial Access: Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and watering hole attacks with a PowerPoint document are used.
   - Execution: A backdoor is downloaded and additional malware is downloaded from the C2 server.
   - Defense Evasion: The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts, which are then executed to download additional malware.
   - Credential Access: The backdoor steals user's Google Chrome credentials.
   - Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with the C2 server and uses resilient communications.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
   - Answer choice A: Yes, aligns best with the attack sequence and the context that the backdoor uses encoded blobs for defense evasion.

Therefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: Yes.
