 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Watering hole tactics, exploits CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782, malware delivery.
   - Execution: Chrome and Internet Explorer exploits, shellcode, dropper.dll, malware download, PowerShell loader, malware execution.
   - Privilege Escalation: PowerShell loader uses LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458.
   - Defense Evasion: Checks for security software, aborts execution if detected.
   - Discovery: SLUB malware interacts with Mattermost server, collects system information, captures screenshots, sends data back to Mattermost server.
   - Command and Control: SLUB malware communicates with Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the likelihood of the SLUB malware automatically exfiltrating the collected data and log files to the C2 server after the Discovery phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the SLUB malware collects system information and captures screenshots during its interaction with a Mattermost server, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the collected data and log files to the C2 server. Since the SLUB malware sends the collected data back to the Mattermost server, it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the data as part of the Discovery phase.

4. Final Answer: A: Yes
