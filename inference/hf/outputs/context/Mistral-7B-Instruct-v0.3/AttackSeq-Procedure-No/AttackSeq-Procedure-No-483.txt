 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Resource Development: FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
   - Initial Access: FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - Execution: FamousSparrow utilized cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor, which was executed on the compromised systems due to the initial access.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access after running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor for Execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI Outline clearly states that FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access. Given the information from the CTI Outline, it is indeed likely that SparrowDoor exploited these same vulnerabilities for Initial Access, as they were used to execute SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.

4. Conclusion:
   - Final Answer: Yes, it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access.
