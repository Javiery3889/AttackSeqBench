 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Spearphishing email with a malicious attachment (XLS or DOC) containing a VBA macro.
   - Execution: The VBA macro decodes and runs JScript data, writes it to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js', and executes it.
   - Defense Evasion: The malware uses base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file.
   - Discovery: NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - Command and Control: NanHaiShu communicates with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers.
   - Exfiltration: The malware is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code for potential data exfiltration.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that NanHaiShu's VBA macro will write JScript data to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and execute it only after establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that the VBA macro does write JScript data to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and executes it. Additionally, the malware modifies the '%regrun%' registry to ensure the network.js file runs automatically.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The VBA macro decodes and runs JScript data, writes it to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js', and executes it. The malware also modifies the '%regrun%' registry to ensure the network.js file runs automatically. Therefore, it is likely that NanHaiShu's VBA macro will decode and execute JScript data by writing it to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and executing it only after establishing persistence by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry. (Final Answer: Yes)
