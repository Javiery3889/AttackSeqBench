 To answer this question, we need to consider the sequence of TTPs in the CTI outline and the context provided.

1. Collection: APT28 collects data by deploying additional modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server.

The question asks about the likelihood of APT28 dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more after collecting data. However, the CTI outline does not provide specific information about file size division or the targeting of political figures and the aerospace industry.

The CTI outline does mention that APT28 collects data using modules like pr.dll and uploads it to the C&C server. But it does not specify any conditions for file size division or the specific industries targeted.

Therefore, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively say whether APT28 divides files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more, or if they target political figures and the aerospace industry.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
