 To answer this question, let's follow the steps:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Poisoned pawn (malware) installed on compromised systems.
   - Execution: The malware runs in the background immediately, and on iOS 7, the icon is hidden. On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
   - Command and Control: The malware sends information out via HTTP and uses POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands. It also uploads files via FTP.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question is asking about the sequence of events after the malware collects a list of processes for discovery. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: hiding the icon, running in the background, sending information out via HTTP, and uploading files via FTP.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - In the CTI outline, we can see that the malware runs in the background immediately after being installed, and on iOS 7, the icon is hidden. However, the question does not specify that the malware sends the gathered information out via HTTP or uploads files via FTP only after hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The question does not provide enough information to definitively say whether the malware sends the gathered information out via HTTP and uploads files via FTP only after hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices. The CTI outline shows that the malware sends information out via HTTP and uploads files via FTP, but it does not specify the sequence of these actions.
   - Final Answer: It is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the provided information.
