 To answer this question, we need to consider the tactics and techniques used by Shuckworm as described in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does not mention the use of HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers or the deployment of software like GOGETTER tunneler or Yamux.

The tactics and techniques used by Shuckworm include Initial Access (phishing email with a malicious document), Execution (using VBS scripts, HTA files, scheduled tasks, and commands via scripts), Persistence (creating scheduled tasks), Defense Evasion (mshta.exe, scheduled tasks, and VBS scripts), and Collection (deploying VBS backdoors).

The question asks about the deployment of software like GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel. Since the CTI outline does not mention the use of such software, it is not possible to definitively say whether Shuckworm is likely to deploy it.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined based on the provided information.
