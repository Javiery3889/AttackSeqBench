 Final Answer: Yes

Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Initial Access: Malicious shortcut files are used to infect hosts with Asruex malware.
   - Execution: Upon opening the malicious shortcut file, a PowerShell command is executed to download a batch file, which then executes PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.
   - Defense Evasion: Asruex malware has anti-analysis features, including the ability to detect virtual machines and stop running if such an environment is detected. It also has the capability to detect anti-virus software.
   - Others: Asruex downloads and executes AdvProv.dll, a plug-in that expands Asruex's functions, including file manipulation and registry operations.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts will download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that during the execution phase, PowerShell scripts are executed to download a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline clearly indicates that PowerShell scripts are used to download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".
