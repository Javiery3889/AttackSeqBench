 Final Answer: A: Yes

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Analyze the CTI outline:
   - Execution: SUNSPOT malware modifies the Orion source code to insert the SUNBURST backdoor.
   - Discovery: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe after modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline shows that SUNSPOT monitors running processes for MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic. Since the Discovery tactic is performed after the Execution tactic, it is likely that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe after modifying the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor.

4. Conclusion:
   - Based on the provided CTI outline and the question, it is likely that SUNSPOT will monitor running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic, so the answer is A: Yes.
