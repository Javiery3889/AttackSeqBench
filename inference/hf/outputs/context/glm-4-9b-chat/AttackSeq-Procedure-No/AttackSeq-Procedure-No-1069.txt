Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Tropic Trooper uses CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 exploits to execute commands, download an installer package, and install it on the system.
- Execution: Installer package drops a backdoor installer, which in turn drops a sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader, and an encrypted configuration file. sidebar.exe is launched by UserInstall.exe using BITSadmin. sidebar.exe is used for DLL hijacking to load wab32res.dll, which is then used to inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
- Persistence: The backdoor loads and decrypts the configuration file, then uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.
- Command and Control: TClient connects to the C&C server using SSL and custom SSL libraries.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline starts with the use of Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package, which then leads to the installation of the backdoor and the subsequent injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
- The question is asking if the FakeRun loader is used to launch dllhost.exe after this sequence. The CTI outline does not mention a FakeRun loader, but it does describe the injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe by the malicious loader.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide information about a FakeRun loader, but it does describe the injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe by a malicious loader after the installer package is executed.
- Since the question specifically asks about the execution of the FakeRun loader, and there is no mention of it in the CTI outline, we cannot confirm that it is used after the described sequence.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer based on the information provided is that we cannot confirm the use of the FakeRun loader after the described sequence.

Final Answer: B: No
