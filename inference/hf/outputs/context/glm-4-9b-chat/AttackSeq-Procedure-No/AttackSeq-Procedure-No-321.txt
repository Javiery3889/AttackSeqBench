1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7, with the icon hidden. It is designed to collect various types of information from the device.
     - Discovery: The app collects text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, lists of installed apps, lists of processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the upload of files via FTP protocol as part of Command and Control operations, followed by the potential use of HTTP to send gathered information.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP for sending information. However, it does describe the app's ability to collect a wide range of information from the iOS device.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app sends the gathered information via HTTP after performing routines on the iOS device.
   - Given that the app is designed to perform various routines and has the capability to upload files via FTP, it is plausible that it could also use HTTP for sending information, especially if the attacker wanted to maintain a lower profile or avoid detection by using a common protocol like HTTP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the malware is capable of collecting a significant amount of information from the iOS device.
   - Step 2: The malware is also capable of uploading files via FTP, which is a common protocol for file transfer.
   - Step 3: The question asks about the likelihood of the malware using HTTP to send the gathered information, which is a common protocol for web traffic and data transfer.
   - Step 4: While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the malware uses HTTP, the fact that it can upload files via FTP suggests that it is designed to communicate with its Command and Control server in some way.
   - Step 5: Considering the context and the common use of HTTP for data transfer, it is reasonable to infer that the malware could use HTTP to send the gathered information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
