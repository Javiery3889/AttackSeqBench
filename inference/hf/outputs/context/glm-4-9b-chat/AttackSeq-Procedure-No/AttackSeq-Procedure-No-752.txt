1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information for potential exploitation through job recruitment activity.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed via Dropbox and an IP address in the United States, containing a macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
     4. Persistence: Rising Sun ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     5. Command and Control: Rising Sun communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     6. Exfiltration: Rising Sun encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     2. Collecting the MAC address of an infected host as part of discovery activities.
     3. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of the MAC address of an infected host as part of the Rising Sun implant's discovery activities. However, it does describe the implant's capabilities, which include executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address before communicating with control servers. Given the implant's capabilities, it is plausible that it could collect such information as part of its discovery activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant has a range of capabilities, including gathering information.
   - Step 2: The question asks if the implant is likely to collect the MAC address before communicating with control servers.
   - Step 3: Since the implant has the capability to gather information, it is reasonable to assume that it could collect the MAC address as part of its discovery process.
   - Step 4: The absence of explicit mention of MAC address collection in the CTI outline does not negate the possibility that the implant could perform this action.

Final Answer: A: Yes
