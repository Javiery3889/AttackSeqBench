1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Scanning for new targets, particularly focusing on Ukraine and Spain.
     2. Initial Access: Employing spear phishing emails, phishing websites, and malicious iFrames.
     3. Execution: Dropping and executing a file to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
     4. Persistence: Changing file timestamps to hide files from victims.
     5. Privilege Escalation: Using a tool to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability.
     6. Defense Evasion: Changing file timestamps and using a proxy tool.
     7. Credential Access: Deploying a password dumping tool.
     8. Discovery: Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
     9. Command and Control: C&C communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption if necessary.
     10. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data to the central server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
     2. Performing discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the discovery phase (scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems) occurred during the reconnaissance phase, which is the initial step of the attack. The outline does not specify that this discovery phase would only occur after deploying additional modules like pr.dll.
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only afterward, which implies that this activity is not part of the initial reconnaissance phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial reconnaissance phase includes scanning for new targets, which is consistent with the use of geographically distributed bots to scan IP ranges and identify vulnerable systems.
   - Step 2: The deployment of additional modules like pr.dll is part of the exfiltration phase, not the discovery phase.
   - Step 3: Since the discovery phase is part of the initial reconnaissance, it is unlikely that APT28 would only perform this activity afterward.
   - Final Answer: B: No
