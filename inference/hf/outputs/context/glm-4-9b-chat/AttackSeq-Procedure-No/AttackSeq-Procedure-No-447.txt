Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection) leads to uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
- Execution: Deployment of custom malware ('IPsec Helper' .NET backdoor) for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
- Persistence: Deployment of webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: Use of webshells with obfuscation and 'IPsec Helper' with trace deletion functionality.
- Lateral Movement: Use of webshells for RDP tunneling and credential harvesting tools for lateral movement.
- Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP for commands and relays.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware before sending recon information or downloading files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware. However, it does describe the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which is used for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
- The sequence of events in the outline suggests that the deployment of the backdoor is followed by its use for lateral movement and command and control activities.
- The question asks about the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware, which are not mentioned in the outline as part of the initial deployment or as subsequent actions after the backdoor is in place.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for sending recon information or downloading files.
- Since the outline does not mention these malware types in the sequence of events, we cannot conclude that they are deployed before the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for its intended purposes.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for command and control activities.

Final Answer: B: No
