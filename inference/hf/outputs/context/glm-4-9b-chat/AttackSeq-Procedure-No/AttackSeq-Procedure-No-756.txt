1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information through malicious documents.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
     4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence on the system.
     5. Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information.
     6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the communication method used by the Rising Sun implant after initial reconnaissance.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of blogs and WordPress for communication by the Rising Sun implant. However, it does state that the implant exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
   - Given that the implant uses HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, it is plausible that it could also use HTTP for communication with the command and control (C2) server, as blogs and WordPress often use HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant uses HTTP POST requests for exfiltration.
   - Step 2: HTTP POST requests are a common method for bidirectional communication over the web.
   - Step 3: Blogs and WordPress are web-based platforms that commonly use HTTP or HTTPS for communication.
   - Step 4: Since the implant is capable of using HTTP for exfiltration, it is reasonable to infer that it could also use HTTP for bidirectional communication with the C2 server.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
