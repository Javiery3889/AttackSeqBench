1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The MuddyWater campaign uses a Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro to execute PowerShell scripts leading to a backdoor payload.
     2. Execution: The Document_Open() event triggers the execution of the malicious routine, which includes sub-functions, image manipulation, and main PowerShell commands.
     3. Persistence: The PowerShell script decodes the contents of the malicious document and executes another encoded PowerShell script, dropping components into the %Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\* directory, and using the main PowerShell file, invoker.ps1, to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.
     4. Command and Control: The PRB-Backdoor communicates with its C&C server for various purposes.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion.
     2. Decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1 for persistence.
     3. Initial access gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     4. Executing these scripts through macro-triggered events.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a sequence where the initial access is gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a Microsoft Word document and executing them through macro-triggered events. The persistence mechanism involves decoded scripts dropping components like invoker.ps1.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts for persistence after the initial access is gained. The outline clearly states that the persistence mechanism involves decoded scripts, which are used to drop components like invoker.ps1.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Initial access is gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a Microsoft Word document.
   - Step 2: The scripts are executed through macro-triggered events.
   - Step 3: Decoded scripts are used to drop components for persistence.
   - Step 4: The campaign's persistence mechanism involves using these decoded scripts to drop components like invoker.ps1.

Final Answer: A: Yes
