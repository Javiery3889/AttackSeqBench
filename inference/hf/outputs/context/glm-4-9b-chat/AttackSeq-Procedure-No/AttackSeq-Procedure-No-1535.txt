Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Konni APT Group delivers an ISO file with a zip file containing malicious scripts.
- Execution: VBScripts and batch files are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'resolve.dns', 'update.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
- Persistence: 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.
- Discovery: 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.
- Collection: 'versioninfo.bat' collects information for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with a C2 server.
- Exfiltration: 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrate data.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if 'stopedge.bat' will manage the deletion of files like 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to evade detection before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details and collects information for exfiltration.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that 'stopedge.bat' is responsible for managing file deletions and scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.
- The 'versioninfo.bat' script is responsible for discovering system details and collecting information for exfiltration.
- The sequence of events suggests that 'stopedge.bat' would be executed before 'versioninfo.bat' to ensure persistence and potentially to delete files that could be used for detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'stopedge.bat' script is designed to maintain persistence by scheduling 'install.vbs' and managing file deletions.
- The 'versioninfo.bat' script is executed to collect information for exfiltration.
- It is plausible that 'stopedge.bat' would delete files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' to prevent detection before 'versioninfo.bat' can execute its discovery and collection functions.
- Therefore, the sequence of actions would be to delete files that could be used for detection before the discovery and collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
