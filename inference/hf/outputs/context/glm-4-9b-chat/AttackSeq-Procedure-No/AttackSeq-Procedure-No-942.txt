1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Watering hole tactics, CVE-2020-0674, CVE-2019-5782 exploits, malware delivery.
   - Execution: Chrome exploit vector, chaining CVE-2019-5782 and an unnamed Chrome bug, custom shellcode, 'dropper.dll' download, PowerShell loader, Internet Explorer exploit vector, CVE-2020-0674, LPE binary (CVE-2019-1458).
   - Defense Evasion: Security software checks, predefined list, malware aborts if detected.
   - Discovery: SLUB variant, Mattermost server interaction, exfiltration of system information and screenshots.
   - Command and Control: SLUB malware variant, Mattermost server, HTTP on port 443, individual channels, notification channel, multiple channels and users.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the Exfiltration phase, specifically the behavior of the SLUB malware after collecting system information and capturing screenshots.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the SLUB variant interacts with a Mattermost server to collect information and capture screenshots during the Discovery phase.
   - The outline does not explicitly state whether the malware automatically exfiltrates the collected data and log files to the C2 server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the SLUB malware automatically exfiltrates data to the C2 server after the Discovery phase.
   - While the outline mentions that the SLUB variant communicates with a Mattermost server, it does not specify the nature of this communication or whether it includes automatic exfiltration.
   - Given the lack of explicit information about automatic exfiltration, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the malware will automatically exfiltrate the data.

Final Answer: B: No
