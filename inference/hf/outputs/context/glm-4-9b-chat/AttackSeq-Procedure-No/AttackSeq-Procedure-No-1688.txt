1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Email with a PDF attachment (executable file) sent to Susan.
     2. Execution: Executable file creates a folder, extracts files, runs scripts, and uses encryption tools.
     3. Persistence: Modifies Windows registry, collects credentials, and configures applications to run batch files.
     4. Defense Evasion: Uses legitimate tools and scripts, avoiding behavior-based detectors.
     5. Collection: Collects credentials recurrently every hour.
     6. Command and Control: Uses FTP command to upload stolen credentials.
     7. Exfiltration: Stolen credentials exfiltrated to an FTP server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.
     2. ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials.
     3. Uploading credentials to an external FTP server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention ARP cache poisoning as a method used by the attackers. The focus is on the use of legitimate tools and scripts, batch files, and FTP for command and control and exfiltration.
   - The attackers are described as evading detection by using legitimate tools and scripts, which suggests they would not use ARP cache poisoning, as it is a more aggressive and less stealthy method that could be detected more easily.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not include ARP cache poisoning as part of the attack methodology.
   - Step 2: The attackers are described as evading detection, which implies they would not use a method that is more likely to be detected.
   - Step 3: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would use ARP cache poisoning, which is not supported by the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
