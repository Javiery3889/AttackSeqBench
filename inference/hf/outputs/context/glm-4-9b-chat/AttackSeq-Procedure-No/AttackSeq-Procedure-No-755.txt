Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information for potential exploitation.
  2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
  3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
  4. Persistence: Rising Sun ensures persistence on the system by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  5. Discovery: Rising Sun performs initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information.
  6. Exfiltration: Rising Sun encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
  2. The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the implant decrypting information during the reconnaissance process. However, it does state that the implant decrypted additional information during the reconnaissance, which could imply that it decrypted and collected some network and system information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant performs reconnaissance by collecting various system and network information, which includes decrypting additional information.
- The question asks if it is likely that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information after communicating with control servers via HTTP POST requests.
- Given that the implant is known to perform reconnaissance and decrypt information during that process, it is plausible that it would do so after establishing communication with the control server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
