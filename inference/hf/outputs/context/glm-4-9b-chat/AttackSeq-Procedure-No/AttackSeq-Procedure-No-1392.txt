Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Discovery
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module
  2. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of AWS Secrets Manager or the enum_secrets module. However, it does describe the reconnaissance phase, which includes leveraging native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
- The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager before gathering information on network and host configurations. The CTI outline does not provide any information about FIN13's use of AWS or the specific tools like enum_secrets.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that FIN13 uses AWS Secrets Manager or the enum_secrets module. The reconnaissance phase is described using native OS binaries and custom malware, which does not include AWS or the mentioned module.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot conclude that FIN13 would use AWS Secrets Manager or the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations.

Final Answer: B: No
