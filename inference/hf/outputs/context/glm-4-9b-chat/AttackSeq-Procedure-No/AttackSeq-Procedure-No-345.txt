Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a dropper malware written in Delphi that downloads a second stage payload from the internet.
- Execution: The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is downloaded and executed. It sets a registry key for persistence.
- Persistence: 'upnphost.exe' uses a registry key to maintain persistence on the system.
- Defense Evasion: The dropper uses evasion techniques, and the dropper was patched to reveal the malicious behavior.
- Discovery: The malware sends system information to an IP address in Hong Kong using 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- Others: The threat actor's attack surface is wide, with C2Cs in Europe and China, and Yara rules are provided for the dropper and payloads.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Discovery

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command following the use of HTTPS communication for command and control operations.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' for discovery.
- The CTI outline indicates that the malware sends system information to an IP address using this command, which aligns with the question's sequence of TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware sends system information to an IP address using the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command, which is a discovery TTP.
- The use of HTTPS for command and control operations does not inherently prevent the malware from performing discovery actions like sending system information.
- Therefore, it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

Final Answer: A: Yes
