Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Konni APT Group delivers an ISO file with a zip containing malicious scripts.
- Execution: VBScripts and batch files are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'resolve.dns', 'update.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
- Defense Evasion: Scripts are obfuscated and 'stopedge.bat' deletes files after execution.
- Discovery: 'versioninfo.bat' discovers information about the user's computer.
- Collection: 'versioninfo.bat' collects information for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with a C2 server.
- Exfiltration: 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrate data.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if persistence will be established by using kernel modules after 'stopedge.bat' deletes files as a means of defense evasion.
- The question mentions Drovorub and Skidmap as techniques that employ kernel modules.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of kernel modules or any techniques similar to Drovorub or Skidmap.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question is focused on persistence after file deletion by 'stopedge.bat'.
- The outline indicates that persistence is established through the scheduling of 'install.vbs' every 33 minutes and the use of batch files, not kernel modules.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide evidence that kernel modules are used for persistence by the Konni APT Group.
- The techniques described in the outline are consistent with the use of batch files and scripts for persistence, not kernel modules.
- Therefore, the answer to whether persistence will be established by using kernel modules after 'stopedge.bat' deletes files is not supported by the information in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
