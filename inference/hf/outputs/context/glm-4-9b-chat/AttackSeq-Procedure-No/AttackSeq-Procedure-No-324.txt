1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7, with the icon hidden and the ability to restart immediately upon termination. On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
     - Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, voice recordings, installed apps, list of processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After collecting information (Discovery phase), the malware will initiate a download via FTP (Command and Control phase).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for command and control. However, it does describe the capabilities of the malware to collect a wide range of information from the infected device.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase. Given that the malware is designed to collect information, it is plausible that it would need to download additional components or commands from a command and control server.
   - Answer choice A: Yes, suggests that the malware is likely to use FTP for command and control.
   - Answer choice B: No, suggests that the malware is unlikely to use FTP for command and control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The malware is designed to collect a variety of information, which implies that it may require additional commands or components to be downloaded for further actions.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the command and control mechanism used by the malware.
   - Step 3: Given the nature of malware and the need for command and control, it is reasonable to assume that the malware could use FTP for such purposes, especially since it is a common method for transferring files.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
