1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     2. Execution: VBS macro executes, retrieves and runs an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, uses .Net Webclient class, and leverages DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
     4. Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
     5. Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are downloaded and executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
     2. Exploit of CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The focus is on the phishing emails delivering Ursnif and GandCrab malware, with the PowerShell script avoiding detection and downloading payloads from C2 servers.
   - The question asks if the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 after gaining initial access through the phishing emails. The CTI outline does not provide any information about the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 or any connection between the phishing emails and the CVE.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Identify the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Step 3: Compare the TTPs from the question with the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Determine that the CTI outline does not mention the exploitation of CVE-2018-13379 or any connection to FortiOS devices.

Final Answer: B: No
