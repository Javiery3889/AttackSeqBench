Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
- Execution: APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
- Privilege Escalation: The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
- Defense Evasion: APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
- Lateral Movement: APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
- Collection: APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
- Command and Control: The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
- Exfiltration: The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Defense Evasion
5. Lateral Movement
6. Collection
7. Command and Control
8. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services servers to access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller after escalating privileges using DLL sideloading techniques and evading defenses by loading a malicious DLL to inject Trochilus payloads into memory.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Privilege Escalation
2. Defense Evasion
3. Gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline does not provide any information about APT10 gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services or accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller. The sequence of TTPs in the question is not directly aligned with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. The outline does not mention any actions related to accessing Azure AD services or Active Directory.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about APT10's actions related to gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services or accessing the Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question is not directly supported by the attack sequence in the CTI outline.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot conclude that APT10 would gather encryption keys from Azure AD services after the described actions.

Final Answer: B: No
