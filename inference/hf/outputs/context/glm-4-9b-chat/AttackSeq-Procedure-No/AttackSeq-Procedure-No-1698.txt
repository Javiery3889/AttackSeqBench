Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Resource Development: The attackers acquired infrastructure and developed capabilities.
  2. Initial Access: The adversaries initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment and exploited a vulnerability.
  3. Execution: The adversaries executed code on the victim's machine using PowerShell and the Empire stager.
  4. Persistence: The adversaries established persistence on the victim system.
  5. Defense Evasion: The adversaries used reflective code loading to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager.
  2. Establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers.
  3. Using secondary C2 servers for communication.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the use of Empire, a post-exploitation framework, which is known for its ability to communicate with command and control (C2) servers. The use of Empire in the attack suggests that the adversaries are likely to use C2 servers for communication.
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversaries will use secondary C2 servers after employing reflective code loading. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of secondary C2 servers, but it does mention the use of primary C2 servers for command and control.
- Given that the adversaries have already established persistence and used Empire, which is designed to communicate with C2 servers, it is plausible that they would use secondary C2 servers for redundancy, to avoid detection, or to maintain control over the victim systems.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence shows that the adversaries have successfully executed their initial access and established persistence on the victim system.
- The use of Empire, a post-exploitation framework, indicates that the adversaries are likely to use C2 servers for command and control.
- While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention secondary C2 servers, the context of using Empire and the need for command and control suggest that secondary C2 servers could be used for additional layers of security and control.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that after employing reflective code loading and establishing connectivity to primary C2 servers, the adversaries are likely to use secondary C2 servers for communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
