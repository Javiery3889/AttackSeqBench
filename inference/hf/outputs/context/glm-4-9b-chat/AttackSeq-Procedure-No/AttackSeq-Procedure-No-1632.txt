Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying, access to remote services, information gathering from compromised accounts.
- Execution: Installation of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, scheduled tasks for execution.
- Persistence: In-memory beacon without persistence, beacon installation on high uptime systems, searching for VPN and firewall configs.
- Privilege Escalation: Password spraying against domain admin accounts, lateral movement to systems with domain admin access, using NtdsAudit and msadcs.exe.
- Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces, Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, timestomping.
- Credential Access: Brute force credential access, credential stuffing or password spraying.
- Discovery: Use of PsLogList for account discovery, lateral movement to domain controllers, and data collection.
- Lateral Movement: Use of Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement methods, moving to domain controllers, and data collection.
- Collection: Data collection from various sources, including information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online.
- Command and Control: Use of Cobalt Strike for C2, switching from DNS to HTTPS for C2 in 2019.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the size threshold at which the adversary would divide files for exfiltration. However, it does mention that the adversary collects data from various sources, including information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online, and that they copy results of the discovery phase, such as file- and directory lists from local systems, network shared drives, and file shares on remote systems.

Given that the adversary is preparing for exfiltration of large chunks of data, it is plausible that they would divide files if the size exceeds a certain threshold to facilitate the exfiltration process. This is a common practice in cyber attacks to avoid detection and to ensure that the exfiltration is successful.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the adversary is sophisticated and has a structured approach to data collection and exfiltration.
- The lack of explicit mention of a size threshold does not negate the likelihood that the adversary would divide files to facilitate exfiltration.
- The adversary's use of Cobalt Strike for C2 and their ability to switch protocols for command and control suggests they are capable of handling large data exfiltration tasks.

Final Answer: A: Yes
