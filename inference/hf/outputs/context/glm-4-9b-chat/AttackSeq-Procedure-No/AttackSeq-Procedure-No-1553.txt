1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links.
     2. Defense Evasion: Use of an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial Access: OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails.
     2. Reconnaissance: Microsoft Word sending a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes an attack where the initial access is gained through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents that contain embedded links. When these documents are opened in Microsoft Word, they send a GET request to the attacker's server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would use this GET request as part of reconnaissance to inform the attackers about the installed software.
   - The answer choices provided are:
     A: Yes
     B: No

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access vector is confirmed to be through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links, which matches the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline states that when the document is opened, it sends a GET request to the attacker's server. This GET request is a form of reconnaissance, as it provides information about the system to the attacker.
   - Step 3: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers would use this GET request for reconnaissance. Given that the GET request is a method of gathering information about the system, it is a plausible use of the technique.
   - Step 4: The answer choice A: Yes, aligns with the plausible use of the GET request for reconnaissance.

Final Answer: A: Yes
