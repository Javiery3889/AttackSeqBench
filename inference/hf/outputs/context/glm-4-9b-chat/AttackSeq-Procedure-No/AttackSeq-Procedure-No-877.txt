1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The Naikon APT group used a weaponized RTF file, a loader, and other methods to gain initial access.
     2. Execution: The Aria-body loader was used to establish persistence and perform various tasks.
     3. Persistence: Persistence was established through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key and by injecting into processes.
     4. Defense Evasion: The group used limited daily windows for C&C servers, fileless loading, and changing server infrastructure.
     5. Discovery: The Aria-body backdoor gathered system and network information.
     6. Collection: The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, etc.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands, specifically in relation to the Discovery tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP and TCP protocols in the Discovery tactic. However, it does mention that the Aria-body backdoor gathers information from the victim's machine, which implies that data collection is part of the Discovery phase.
   - The outline does not specify the protocols used for data exfiltration or command and control communication. It does mention that the Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to contact C&C servers, but it does not specify the protocols used for this communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Discovery tactic involves gathering information from the victim's machine, which is a critical step in understanding the environment and preparing for further actions.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline does not provide information about the protocols used for data exfiltration or command and control communication.
   - Step 3: Without explicit information about the protocols used in the Discovery phase, we cannot definitively conclude that HTTP and TCP were used.
   - Step 4: The question asks if the Naikon APT group is "likely" to use HTTP and TCP, which implies a degree of probability rather than certainty.

Final Answer: B: No
