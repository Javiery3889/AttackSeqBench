1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Persistence: The group drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access.
     2. Command and Control: APT29 deploys custom malware known as WellMess or WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using stolen credentials to maintain persistent access.
     2. Deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services.
     3. Conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention vulnerability scanning or deploying public exploits on identified vulnerable services. However, it does mention that APT29 uses WellMess and WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim's system, which could imply that they are looking for vulnerabilities to exploit.
   - The question asks if the group will deploy public exploits after conducting vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses. The outline does not provide information on whether APT29 conducts vulnerability scanning or if they use public exploits in this manner.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that APT29 seeks to maintain persistent access by obtaining legitimate credentials and uses custom malware for further operations.
   - Step 2: The outline does not mention vulnerability scanning or public exploits as part of their tactics.
   - Step 3: Since the outline does not provide information on vulnerability scanning or public exploits, we cannot confirm that APT29 would conduct vulnerability scanning before deploying public exploits.
   - Step 4: Therefore, we cannot conclude that the group will deploy public exploits after conducting vulnerability scanning based on the information provided.

Final Answer: B: No
