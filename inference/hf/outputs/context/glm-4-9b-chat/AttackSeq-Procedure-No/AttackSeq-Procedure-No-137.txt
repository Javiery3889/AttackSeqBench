Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers compromised a website and redirected visitors to the infecting code, exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
- Execution: The malware executes a multi-stage infection process, exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
- Persistence: The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself and creating a Run registry key.
- Privilege Escalation: The downloader exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
- Defense Evasion: The downloader exits if it detects antivirus software processes.
- Discovery: The SLUB backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parses it for commands to execute.
- Collection: The backdoor collects information and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack using hardcoded authentication tokens.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Discovery: Downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute.
  2. Exfiltration: Creating archive files of user's Desktop folders.
  3. Command and Control: Posting download links to the Slack channel.
  4. Building CAB files.

- The CTI outline does not explicitly state the order of exfiltration and command and control activities. However, it does mention that the backdoor collects information and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration, which aligns with the second step in the question's sequence.

- The outline also states that the backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, which aligns with the fourth step in the question's sequence.

- The outline does not mention the creation of CAB files, which is the third step in the question's sequence. However, it does not contradict this step either.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SLUB backdoor is designed to collect information and exfiltrate it, which includes creating archives of user's Desktop folders. This aligns with the second step in the question's sequence.
- The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, which aligns with the fourth step in the question's sequence.
- The absence of information about the creation of CAB files in the CTI outline does not necessarily mean it does not occur, but it is not confirmed either.

Final Answer: A: Yes
