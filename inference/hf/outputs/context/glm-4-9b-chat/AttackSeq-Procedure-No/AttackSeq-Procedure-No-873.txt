1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The attackers exploited a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits.
     2. Privilege Escalation: The attackers used an elevation of privilege exploit to gain system privileges by exploiting CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.
     2. The Stager module notifying of successful exploitation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if the Stager module will notify after the initial access and privilege escalation steps. According to the CTI outline, the initial access is gained through a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits, and the privilege escalation is achieved using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
   - The Stager module is typically the component that is responsible for delivering the payload and setting up the command and control (C2) communication. It is expected to notify of successful exploitation after the initial access and privilege escalation steps are completed.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Initial access is gained through a chain of zero-day exploits.
   - Step 2: Privilege escalation is achieved by exploiting CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
   - Step 3: The Stager module is responsible for delivering the payload and would notify after the initial access and privilege escalation steps are completed.
   - Step 4: Since the Stager module's notification is contingent on the successful completion of the initial access and privilege escalation, the answer to the question is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
