Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: The APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
  2. Defense Evasion: APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection by security software and firewall interception, including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and the use of multi-beacon communication.
  3. Lateral Movement: APT-TOCS depended on network projection and could laterally move within the internal network as required to conduct an attack.
  4. Command and Control: APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.
  5. Others: Additional context about the threat actor and the nature of the attack.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Initial Access: APT-TOCS gained initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
  2. Defense Evasion: Employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.
  3. Core Step: Execution of Shellcode script functionalities in memory.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.
- According to the CTI outline, the attack sequence is:
  - Initial Access: The APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
  - Defense Evasion: APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection, including running in memory and using multi-beacon communication.
  - Lateral Movement: APT-TOCS laterally moved within the internal network.
  - Command and Control: APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts for command and control.

The sequence of events suggests that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory as part of the Initial Access phase, which is before the Defense Evasion phase. The use of multi-beacon communication is part of the Defense Evasion phase and is not directly related to the execution of the Shellcode script functionalities in memory.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory as part of the Initial Access phase.
- Multi-beacon communication is a Defense Evasion technique used to evade detection, not directly related to the execution of the Shellcode script.
- Therefore, the Shellcode script functionalities were not executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication.

Final Answer: B: No
