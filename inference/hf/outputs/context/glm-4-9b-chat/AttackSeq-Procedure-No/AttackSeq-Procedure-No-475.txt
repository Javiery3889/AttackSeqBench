1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, replacing the legitimate netd and inheriting root privileges.
     2. Persistence: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd to persist on the system.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel executes shell scripts as the root user.
     4. Defense Evasion: The malware ensures it is run as intended by checking execution context.
     5. Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes credentials and deploys tcpdump for network traffic monitoring.
     6. Discovery: Infamous Chisel discovers files, GPS information, installed packages, and performs IP scanning.
     7. Collection: Infamous Chisel collects files from local system directories.
     8. Command and Control: Infamous Chisel provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for SSH connections.
     9. Exfiltration: Infamous Chisel exfiltrates files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd service.
     2. The malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that after replacing the legitimate netd service, Infamous Chisel's netd component is responsible for automatically exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline identifies that Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd service as part of its Execution phase.
   - Step 2: The outline also specifies that the netd component of Infamous Chisel is responsible for exfiltrating files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - Step 3: The question asks if it is likely that the malware will automatically exfiltrate files after replacing the netd service.
   - Step 4: Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is indeed likely that the malware will perform this action as it is a direct function of the netd component.

Final Answer: A: Yes
