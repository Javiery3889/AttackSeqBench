Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Resource Development
  3. Initial Access
  4. Execution
  5. Persistence
  6. Privilege Escalation
  7. Defense Evasion
  8. Credential Access
  9. Lateral Movement
  10. Collection
  11. Command and Control
  12. Exfiltration
  13. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. T1553 Subvert Trust Controls
  2. T1057 Process Discovery
  3. T1071 Application Layer Protocol

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not provide explicit details on the sequence in which T1553 and T1057 were used, but it does mention that T1553 was used for Defense Evasion.
- The outline also mentions that T1071 was used for Command and Control.
- The question asks if T1057 (Process Discovery) was employed after T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) for gaining knowledge about the systems and internal networks.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence of events for T1057 and T1071. However, it is common for attackers to gather information about the environment before establishing command and control channels.
- Given that T1057 (Process Discovery) is a technique used to enumerate processes running on a system, it is plausible that the attackers would use this technique to understand the systems and networks before setting up command and control infrastructure.
- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) is used for command and control, which typically comes after the initial reconnaissance and information gathering phases.
- Therefore, it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery for gaining knowledge about the systems and internal networks only after leveraging compromised infrastructure for command and control using T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
