Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) on the PCA website.
  2. Execution: Deployed the malware payload Rdws.exe, which used DLL sideloading to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) and a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
  3. Defense Evasion: Used sideloading techniques to evade defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication.
  2. Using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL as part of the Defense Evasion tactic. This matches the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will use sideloading techniques after connecting back to the exploit domain. Since the CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of sideloading techniques, it is reasonable to assume that the malware would continue to use these techniques as part of its evasion strategy.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that the attackers have used sideloading techniques in the past, which is a method of deploying a malicious DLL. This suggests that the malware is likely to continue using this technique.
- The question asks about the likelihood of the malware using sideloading techniques after connecting back to the exploit domain, which is a scenario that aligns with the observed behavior of the attackers.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the context of the question, it is plausible that the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
