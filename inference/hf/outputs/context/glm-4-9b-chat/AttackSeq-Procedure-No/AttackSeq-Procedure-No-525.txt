Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
  2. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious documents (CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352) and watering hole attacks.
  3. Execution: Backdoor used by Dropping Elephant is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
  4. Defense Evasion: The backdoor uses encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to evade detection.
  5. Credential Access: The backdoor steals user credentials.
  6. Command and Control: The backdoor pings the C2 server and uses resilient communications.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
  2. The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the backdoor's behavior, including the use of encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The first TTP in the question, the file-stealer module iterating through directories, is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the outline does describe the backdoor's behavior, which includes downloading and executing additional malware, which could include a file-stealer module.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion.
- The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor will perform this action, which is directly supported by the information in the CTI outline.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
