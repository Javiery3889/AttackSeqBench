1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Stolen credentials are used to gain access, followed by setting up remote tunneling with SSH tools.
     2. Execution: Malicious code is executed using scripts, encrypted files, and PowerShell loader.
     3. Defense Evasion: Techniques like process injection and deobfuscation are used.
     4. Discovery: The SombRAT backdoor collects information using various tools.
     5. Collection: Collected data is archived using a custom storage file format.
     6. Command and Control: The SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP with SSL-encrypted traffic.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the method of exfiltration after establishing communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP with SSL-encrypted traffic. This suggests that the backdoor is designed to use secure protocols for communication.
   - The question asks whether the SombRAT backdoor is likely to exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. Since the backdoor is already using secure protocols (HTTPS for C2 traffic), it is reasonable to assume that it would continue to use secure protocols for exfiltration as well.
   - Answer choice A: Yes, it is likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS, which are secure protocols.
   - Answer choice B: No, it is not likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol, as it is already using secure protocols for C2 communication.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor uses SSL-encrypted traffic for C2 communication.
   - Step 2: Secure communication protocols like HTTPS and SMTPS are commonly used for exfiltration to avoid detection.
   - Step 3: There is no indication in the CTI outline that the attackers would switch to a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration.
   - Step 4: Based on the use of secure protocols for C2 communication and the common practice in cyber attacks, it is plausible that the SombRAT backdoor would continue to use secure protocols for exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
