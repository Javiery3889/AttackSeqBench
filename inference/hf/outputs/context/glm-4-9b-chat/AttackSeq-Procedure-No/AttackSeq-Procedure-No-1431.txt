1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Supply chain attack via 3CX software.
     2. Execution: Smooth Operator malware executes as part of the 3CX software.
     3. Persistence: Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
     4. Defense Evasion: Smooth Operator employs several defense evasion techniques.
     5. Discovery: Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine.
     6. Collection: Smooth Operator stages collect data from the victim machine.
     7. Command and Control: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS using a custom data encoding algorithm.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Exfiltration via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request.
     2. Communication with C2 servers over HTTPS.
     3. Use of a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation, which aligns with the second and third TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The first TTP in the question, exfiltration via a HTTP GET request, is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a plausible step in the attack sequence, as Smooth Operator is known to collect and exfiltrate data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline also confirms that Smooth Operator uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
   - Step 3: The exfiltration method is not explicitly mentioned but is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
   - Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is likely that Smooth Operator will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation after exfiltrating collected data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
