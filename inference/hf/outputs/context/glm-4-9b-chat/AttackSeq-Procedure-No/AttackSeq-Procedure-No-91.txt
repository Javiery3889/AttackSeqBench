Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Execution: The attack starts with the execution of the Vyveva backdoor via a service (T1569.002) and uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106).
- Persistence: The installer creates a new service to establish persistence for the loader (T1543.003).
- Defense Evasion: The backdoor decrypts strings and components, timestomps files, masquerades tasks or services, modifies the registry, and has encrypted strings and components.
- Discovery: The backdoor can obtain file and directory listings, list running processes, obtain system information, local IP address, and system time and time zone.
- Command and Control: The backdoor encrypts C&C traffic using XOR, communicates with C&C via Tor, and exfiltrates data to the C&C server.
- Exfiltration: The backdoor exfiltrates data to its C&C server.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Execution (T1569.002, T1106)
2. Persistence (T1543.003)
3. Defense Evasion (T1140, T1070.006, T1036.004, T1112, T1027)
4. Discovery (T1083, T1057, T1082, T1016, T1124)
5. Command and Control (T1573.001, T1573.002, T1041)
6. Exfiltration (T1041)

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Collect files from newly inserted removable media
2. Notify the C&C about these files
3. Obtain information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery

Based on the CTI outline, the discovery phase (T1083, T1057, T1082, T1016, T1124) comes before the command and control phase (T1573.001, T1573.002, T1041). This suggests that the backdoor would likely obtain information such as the local IP address and system time before it can communicate with the C&C server.

The question does not specify the exact TTPs, but it implies that the backdoor would need to perform discovery actions before it can notify the C&C server about new files. The discovery actions include obtaining the local IP address and system time, which are part of the discovery phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor's discovery phase includes obtaining system information, which would include the local IP address and system time (T1082, T1124).
- The command and control phase involves encrypting C&C traffic and exfiltrating data to the C&C server (T1573.001, T1573.002, T1041).
- The question asks if the backdoor would notify the C&C about new files after obtaining the required information, which is consistent with the sequence of actions in the discovery phase.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the backdoor would collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining the necessary information.

Final Answer: A: Yes
