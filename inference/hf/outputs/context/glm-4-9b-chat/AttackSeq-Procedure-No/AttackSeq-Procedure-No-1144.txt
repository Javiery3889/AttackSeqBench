1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The use of masscan to identify potential entry points.
     2. Reconnaissance: The use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources.
     3. Reconnaissance: The discovery of non-trivial ports and services that could be exploited.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of AdFind to gather information about organizational units (OUs) and domain trusts from Active Directory.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the reconnaissance phase of the attack, which includes identifying potential entry points and publicly available resources. It does not mention the use of AdFind or any specific tool for gathering information from Active Directory.
   - The question asks if it is likely that AdFind will be used after identifying potential entry points. Since the outline does not provide any information about AdFind or Active Directory exploitation, we cannot directly infer that AdFind would be used in this context.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline focuses on the reconnaissance phase and does not mention AdFind or Active Directory exploitation.
   - Step 2: The question asks about the likelihood of using AdFind after reconnaissance, which is not covered in the outline.
   - Step 3: Without information about the use of AdFind in the outline, we cannot confirm or deny its use based on the provided data.

Final Answer: B: No
