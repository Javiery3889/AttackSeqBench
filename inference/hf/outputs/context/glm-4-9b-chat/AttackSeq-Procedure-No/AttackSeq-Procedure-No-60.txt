1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The attack starts with spam emails distributing the Grandoreiro malware, often using fake Java or Flash updates, and exploiting COVID-19 fears.
   - Persistence: The malware creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - Privilege Escalation: Techniques are used to gain higher-level permissions, including hooking APIs, killing processes, and changing file system paths.
   - Credential Access: The malware can steal credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
   - Discovery: The malware collects information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.
   - Command and Control: Communication with the C&C server is done using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.
   - Others: The malware has been active since 2017, targets specific countries, and uses a DGA to hide the C&C address.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the malware restarting the machine in safe mode. However, the Persistence and Discovery phases are relevant to the question.
   - The Persistence phase indicates that the malware ensures it remains on the system across restarts, which could imply that it would not need to restart in safe mode to maintain its presence.
   - The Discovery phase is where the malware collects information about the victim's computer, which could be a step taken after establishing persistence and before escalating privileges or accessing credentials.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The malware's persistence mechanism is designed to maintain its presence across restarts, suggesting it does not need to restart in safe mode to remain on the system.
   - Step 2: The Discovery phase comes after Persistence, indicating that the malware would likely collect information after ensuring it is persistent on the system.
   - Step 3: There is no evidence in the CTI outline that suggests the malware restarts in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information.

Final Answer: B: No
