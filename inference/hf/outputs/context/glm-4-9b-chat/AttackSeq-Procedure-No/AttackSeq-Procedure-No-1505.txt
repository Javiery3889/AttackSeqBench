Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
  2. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising and compromised websites.
  3. Execution: RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
  4. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of proxy servers within RIG EK's infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states in the Defense Evasion section that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. This directly aligns with the TTP mentioned in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline explicitly mentions the use of proxy servers as a Defense Evasion technique by RIG EK.
- The question asks if it is likely that proxy servers will be used within RIG EK's infrastructure to make infections harder to detect.
- Given the information provided in the CTI outline, the answer is directly supported by the outlined attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
