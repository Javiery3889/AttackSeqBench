1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: SCILabs identified a new Cosmic Banker attack targeting Mexican banking institutions.
     2. Initial Access: The attack begins with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, leading to the download of a malicious attachment.
     3. Execution: The malicious .bat file triggers the attack, which includes a PowerShell script that downloads the main malware library.
     4. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence.
     5. Defense Evasion: The malware uses VMProtect packer to evade detection.
     6. Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials and accesses Outlook info to collect email accounts.
     7. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts.
     8. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains for downloading malware and sending collected data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. After accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.
     2. Will the collected email accounts be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers?

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for exfiltration. However, it does state that the PowerShell script communicates with specific domains for downloading malware and sending collected data. This suggests that the data collection and exfiltration are part of the same process controlled by the PowerShell script.
   - The question asks if the email accounts collected from Outlook MAPI are exfiltrated over FTP. The outline does not provide information about the method of exfiltration, only that data is sent to specific domains.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not specify the method of exfiltration for the collected email accounts.
   - Step 2: The PowerShell script is responsible for both data collection and communication with the C2 domains.
   - Step 3: Since the method of exfiltration is not specified in the outline, we cannot conclude that it is over FTP.
   - Step 4: Therefore, we cannot confirm that the email accounts are exfiltrated over FTP based on the information provided.

Final Answer: B: No
