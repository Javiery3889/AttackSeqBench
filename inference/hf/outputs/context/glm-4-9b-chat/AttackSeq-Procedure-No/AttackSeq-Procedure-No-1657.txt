Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: APT phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- Execution: VBScript downloads a .doc file, which opens and executes a PowerShell attack to install Poison Ivy.
- Execution: VBScript creates a shell object and executes a PowerShell command to run base64 encoded code, which downloads and executes a .ps1 file.
- Execution: The .ps1 file contains more base64 encoded code, which is decoded and executed, infecting the system.
- Command and Control: Malware communicates with a C2 server at 61.97.243.15 using the domain 'web.outlooksysm.net'.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the FHAPPI campaign's attack sequence, which includes the use of VBScript and PowerShell to execute code without installing files on the system, which is a form of fileless technique.
- The campaign's use of fileless techniques is evident in the initial execution phase, where the VBScript is used to create a shell object and execute PowerShell commands without installing any files.
- The campaign's connection to the C2 server at 61.97.243.15 is part of the command and control phase, which comes after the initial infection and execution of the payload.

Given that the campaign has already used fileless techniques in the initial access and execution phases, it is plausible that it would continue to use such techniques to avoid detection. The question specifically asks if the campaign would use fileless techniques "only after establishing connection with the C2 server," which suggests that the fileless techniques are used as a means to avoid detection during the initial stages of the attack, not necessarily after connecting to the C2 server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The FHAPPI campaign has already demonstrated the use of fileless techniques in the initial access and execution phases.
- The question asks if the campaign would use fileless techniques after connecting to the C2 server, which is a part of the command and control phase.
- Since the campaign has already used fileless techniques, it is reasonable to assume that it would continue to use them to avoid detection throughout the attack, not just after connecting to the C2 server.

Final Answer: B: No
