1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The StellarParticle campaign gained access via SSH and RDP, used VPNs, and exported Chrome browser passwords.
   - Persistence: They used credential hopping, Delegated Administrator rights, and malware for persistence (WMI and crontab).
   - Defense Evasion: They stole browser cookies and renamed utilities to bypass MFA and masquerade as legitimate binaries.
   - Discovery: They used AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tools to gather information.
   - Lateral Movement: They used RDP with both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
   - Collection: They accessed data from Information Repositories.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the StellarParticle campaign is likely to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the StellarParticle campaign used web session cookies as part of their defense evasion techniques to bypass MFA. This suggests that they were likely to have already accessed the cloud resources using these cookies.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question is: credential hopping, configuring malware (TrailBlazer for WMI persistence), and then stealing web session cookies.
   - The outline does not explicitly state the order in which these TTPs were used, but it does mention that the campaign used credential hopping and malware for persistence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The StellarParticle campaign is known to use credential hopping and malware for persistence, which are steps that would likely occur after initial access.
   - The outline does not provide a clear sequence of events that would confirm whether the campaign would steal web session cookies only after these steps.
   - However, the fact that they used web session cookies to bypass MFA suggests that they had already accessed cloud resources, which would imply that they had already stolen the cookies.
   - Therefore, it is plausible that the campaign would steal web session cookies from end-user workstations as part of their initial access or early stages of the attack, rather than only after credential hopping and configuring malware.

Final Answer: B: No
