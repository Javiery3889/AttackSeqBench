1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence described in the CTI outline is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: GreyEnergy group uses two main infection vectors.
        a. Compromise a public-facing web service running on a server connected to an internal network.
        b. Use spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to drop "GreyEnergy mini" backdoor.
     2. Lateral Movement: After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, attackers map the network and collect passwords.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Collect domain administrator privileges using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.
     4. Persistence: With domain administrator privileges, the attackers can control the whole network.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Compromise a computer using GreyEnergy mini.
     2. Use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.
     3. Use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy. It only describes the use of Nmap and Mimikatz for mapping the network and collecting credentials.
   - The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after the described actions.
   - Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of PDQ Deploy, we cannot confirm that this is part of their TTPs.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Identify the sequence of TTPs in the question.
   - Step 3: Compare the TTPs in the question with the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Determine that the use of PDQ Deploy is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
