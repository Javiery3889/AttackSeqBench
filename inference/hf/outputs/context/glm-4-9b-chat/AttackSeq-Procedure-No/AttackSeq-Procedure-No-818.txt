1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: The malware executes and reads its configuration, loads a DLL module, and prepares to steal information.
     2. Defense Evasion: The malware employs defense evasion techniques such as encoding configuration files and using encrypted channels for C2 communication.
     3. Discovery: The malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration, as well as data from SNS applications.
     4. Collection: The malware collects data from various sources on the victim's PC and processes it into ".a" files.
     5. Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates the stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Use the FTP protocol for C2 communication.
     2. Steal information from SNS applications.
     3. Encrypt this data using AES.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of the FTP protocol for C2 communication. Instead, it states that the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted channels, specifically encrypting an AES key with RSA and sending it to the C2 server.
   - The outline does mention that the malware steals information from SNS applications and encrypts it using AES128bit ECB mode before sending it to the C2 server.
   - The answer choices provided are:
     A: Yes
     B: No

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not indicate the use of the FTP protocol for C2 communication.
   - Step 2: The outline does confirm that the malware steals information from SNS applications and encrypts it using AES.
   - Step 3: Since the use of the FTP protocol is not mentioned in the CTI outline, we cannot assume that WinDealer will use it.
   - Step 4: The sequence of TTPs in the question does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, as the use of FTP is not part of the outlined sequence.

Final Answer: B: No
