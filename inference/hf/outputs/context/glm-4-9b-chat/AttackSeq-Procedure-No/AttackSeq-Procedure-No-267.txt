Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
  2. Execution: Custom loader executes the Korplug variant.
  3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence on the system.
  4. Defense Evasion: Use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
  5. Discovery: Collection of system information.
  6. Command and Control: Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
  7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
  2. Data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control, which is a TCP-based protocol. It does not specify the order in which these actions are taken. However, it does not contradict the idea that data exfiltration could occur before gathering data from network shared drives.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide a specific sequence of events regarding when data exfiltration occurs relative to gathering data from network shared drives. It only states that data exfiltration is done via a custom TCP-based protocol.
- The question asks if Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives. Since the outline does not specify the order of these actions, we cannot definitively say that data exfiltration must occur before gathering data from network shared drives.
- Therefore, the answer to whether the malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration before gathering data from network shared drives is not supported by the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
