Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The CosmicDuke samples use a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials, as well as exporting certificates and private keys.
- Discovery: The malware searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames with certain keywords.
- Command and Control: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
- Exfiltration: The information collected is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer after exfiltrating data via FTP and before searching removable drives and skipping certain file types.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer. However, it does describe the exfiltration process, which is the automatic upload of collected data to remote servers via FTP.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question is as follows: exfiltration, searching removable drives, and skipping certain file types.
- The CTI outline does not provide information about searching removable drives or skipping file types, but it does mention the exfiltration process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer after exfiltration.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question is not directly supported by the CTI outline, as the outline does not mention the specific order of these actions.
- Given the lack of information in the CTI outline about the use of additional information-gathering tools like a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, we cannot conclude that CosmicDuke is likely to use these tools after exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
