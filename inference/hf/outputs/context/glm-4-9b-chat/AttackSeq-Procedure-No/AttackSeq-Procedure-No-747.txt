Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information for potential exploitation through job recruitment activity.
  2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed via Dropbox and an IP address in the United States, containing a macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
  3. Execution: The macro executes shellcode that acts as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant.
  4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  5. Command and Control: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
  6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  2. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
  3. Performing initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests before performing initial reconnaissance.
- The sequence in the outline suggests that the communication with control servers (Step 5) comes after ensuring persistence (Step 4).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the implant ensures persistence first, followed by communication with control servers.
- The question asks if the communication with control servers occurs before initial reconnaissance, which would be out of sequence based on the outline.
- Therefore, the Rising Sun implant is not likely to communicate with control servers before performing initial reconnaissance.

Final Answer: B: No
