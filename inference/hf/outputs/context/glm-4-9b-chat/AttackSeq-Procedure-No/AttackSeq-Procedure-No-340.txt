1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Persistence: FIN1 uses a bootkit named Nemesis to infect the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR) for persistence.
     2. Command and Control: The Nemesis malware ecosystem includes backdoors with support for various network protocols and communication channels for command and control (CnC).

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. The Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the placement of install files into directories excluded from scanning. However, it does state that the malware's installation location ensures it remains even after an operating system reinstallation, which is a common technique for evading detection.
   - The question asks if the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories excluded from scanning. While the outline does not provide direct evidence of this specific TTP, it does suggest that the malware is designed to be persistent and difficult to detect and eradicate.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The outline indicates that the malware is designed to be persistent and difficult to detect, which implies that the threat actor would likely use various techniques to achieve this goal.
   - Step 2: The outline does not provide specific details about the placement of install files, but it does mention that the malware is rare and difficult to detect, suggesting that the threat actor may use unconventional methods to avoid detection.
   - Step 3: Given the context of the outline and the nature of bootkits, it is plausible that the malware could use directories excluded from scanning as a method to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
