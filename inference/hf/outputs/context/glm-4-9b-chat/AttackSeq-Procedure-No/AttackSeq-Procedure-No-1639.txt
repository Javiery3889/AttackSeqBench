Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying, access to remote services, obtaining information from cloud resources.
- Execution: Installation of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, use of scheduled tasks.
- Persistence: Loading beacon in memory, searching for VPN and firewall configs.
- Privilege Escalation: Password spraying against domain admin accounts, using NtdsAudit and other tools.
- Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces, using timestomping and other anti-forensics techniques.
- Credential Access: Brute force credential access, credential stuffing or password spraying.
- Discovery: Use of PsLogList and other tools for account discovery and system information gathering.
- Lateral Movement: Use of Cobalt Strike's lateral movement capabilities, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
- Command and Control: Use of Cobalt Strike for C2, switching protocols over time.
- Exfiltration: Exfiltration of small amounts of data using Cobalt Strike's C2 channel, and use of a custom tool for larger data exfiltration to cloud storage services.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying results of the discovery phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the adversary uses a custom tool for exfiltrating larger chunks of data, such as mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property, to cloud storage web services.
- The discovery phase results, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives, are not explicitly mentioned as being exfiltrated using cloud storage services.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not specify that the adversary uses cloud storage web services for exfiltrating the results of the discovery phase, but rather for exfiltrating larger amounts of data.
- The question asks if the adversary will use cloud storage for the discovery phase results, which are not explicitly mentioned as being exfiltrated in this manner.
- Given the information provided, it is not likely that the adversary would use cloud storage for the discovery phase results, as the CTI outline focuses on the use of cloud storage for larger data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
