1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Analyzing attackers' infrastructure, identifying IPs, and using compromised websites.
     2. Initial Access: Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports, mimicking popular software, and targeting supply-chain processes.
     3. Execution: Abusing command and script interpreters, executing commands, scripts, or binaries, and scheduling local jobs.
     4. Persistence: Using LD_PRELOAD, creating new user accounts, and using chroot.
     5. Privilege Escalation: Using hostPath mount and chroot.
     6. Defense Evasion: Removing security software and using obfuscated files.
     7. Credential Access: Collecting credentials and creating hidden users.
     8. Command and Control: Using proxy tools and legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
     9. Exfiltration: Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
     10. Impact: Cryptocurrency mining and other objectives.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access.
     2. Detecting compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access. The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of DOCKERGEDDON or any other tool for reconnaissance. However, it does mention that attackers used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities and exploit them, which could include the use of such tools for reconnaissance.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the adversaries are attempting to detect the compromised Docker APIs before deploying malicious containers, which would be part of the reconnaissance phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access phase is described as the exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - Step 2: The question asks if the adversaries would detect the compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance.
   - Step 3: Reconnaissance typically occurs before the deployment of malicious containers, as it is part of the preparation phase of an attack.
   - Step 4: The CTI outline suggests that the attackers used various tools and methods for reconnaissance and exploitation, which could include the use of DOCKERGEDDON.
   - Step 5: Given that reconnaissance is a preparatory phase and the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON is consistent with the tactics used by the attackers, it is plausible that the adversaries would use such tools during reconnaissance.

Final Answer: A: Yes
