1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery
     2. Lateral Movement (tainting shared content)
     3. Persistence

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if, after the discovery phase, attackers will taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
   - According to the CTI outline, the discovery phase comes before the lateral movement phase, which is a part of the execution phase. After discovery, the next logical step would be to move laterally within the network to access more systems, users, and data relevant to the mission.
   - Tainting shared content is a method that could be used to achieve lateral movement, as it allows attackers to spread to other systems without the need for additional persistence points at that moment.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The discovery phase is followed by lateral movement to access more systems.
   - Step 2: Tainting shared content is a method that can be used to achieve lateral movement.
   - Step 3: Lateral movement is often a precursor to installing persistence points on new systems.
   - Step 4: Therefore, it is plausible that after the discovery phase, attackers would taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points.

Final Answer: A: Yes
