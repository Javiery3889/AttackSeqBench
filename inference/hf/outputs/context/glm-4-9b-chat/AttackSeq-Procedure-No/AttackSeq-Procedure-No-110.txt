1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Persistence
     2. Lateral movement (specifically, transferring files to a network share)
     3. Internal spearphishing techniques

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that tools will be moved laterally after persistence is established. Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs after persistence would be:
     1. Privilege Escalation (to install malware or persistence points)
     2. Defense Evasion (to bypass detection mechanisms)
     3. Credential Access (to access systems and data)
     4. Discovery (to locate systems, users, and data)
     5. Collection (to collect relevant data)
     6. Command and Control (to maintain control over the compromised infrastructure)
     7. Exfiltration (to extract the data)
   - The question specifically mentions "transferring files to a network share" and "internal spearphishing techniques," which are not explicitly listed in the CTI outline as immediate steps following persistence. However, lateral movement is a common TTP after persistence, and transferring files to a network share could be a part of that.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Persistence is established, which is the fourth phase in the attack sequence.
   - Step 2: The next phase in the attack sequence is Privilege Escalation, but the question is about lateral movement, which is not directly listed after persistence.
   - Step 3: Lateral movement is a common TTP after persistence, and transferring files to a network share is a method of lateral movement.
   - Step 4: Internal spearphishing techniques could be used to facilitate lateral movement or to maintain persistence by obtaining additional credentials.
   - Step 5: Based on the common tactics used after persistence, it is plausible that tools would be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques.

Final Answer: A: Yes
