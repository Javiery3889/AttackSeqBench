1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Credential Access (using Procdump and Mimikatz)
     2. Employing 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks
     3. Using PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy in the Fox Kitten Campaign. The tools and techniques listed for lateral movement include the creation of local admin users, manipulation of accessibility tools, and the use of JuicyPotato for local privilege escalation. The outline also mentions the use of legitimate Microsoft tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz, which are consistent with the question's mention of these tools for credential access.
   - The question asks if the campaign is likely to use PDQ Deploy after achieving credential access. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software deployment tool, and the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of such tools by the Fox Kitten Campaign for lateral movement.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the sequence of TTPs in the question and compare them with the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Note that the CTI outline does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy by the Fox Kitten Campaign.
   - Step 3: Recognize that the use of legitimate tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz is consistent with the campaign's tactics, but the specific use of PDQ Deploy is not mentioned.
   - Step 4: Conclude that since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of PDQ Deploy by the Fox Kitten Campaign, we cannot assume it is part of their TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
