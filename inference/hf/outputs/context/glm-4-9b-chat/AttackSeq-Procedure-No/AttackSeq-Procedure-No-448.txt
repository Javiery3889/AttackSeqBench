Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection), uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
- Execution: Deploying custom malware ('IPsec Helper' .NET backdoor), used for exfiltration, deploying additional malware, persistence, executing commands, uploading files, and updating configuration.
- Persistence: Deploying webshells, registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
- Defense Evasion: Using webshells with ASPXSpy variations and custom base64 encoding, 'IPsec Helper' updates engine and deletes traces.
- Lateral Movement: Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic, leveraging compromised accounts, and using offensive security tools for credential harvesting.
- Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP, awaits commands for updates, recon, file downloads, and self-deletion.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions as part of its data destruction activities after sending recon information or downloading files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of CaddyWiper or any specific data destruction activities. However, it does describe the capabilities of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which includes the ability to execute commands, download files, and self-delete.
- The question suggests that after sending recon information or downloading files, Agrius might deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction. This is a plausible scenario, as threat actors often use such destructive tools to cover their tracks or cause further damage.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that Agrius has the capability to execute commands and download files, which could include deploying additional malware like CaddyWiper.
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to use CaddyWiper, which is a plausible action given the context of the attack and the capabilities of the malware they use.
- There is no information in the CTI outline that contradicts the use of CaddyWiper for data destruction.

Final Answer: A: Yes
