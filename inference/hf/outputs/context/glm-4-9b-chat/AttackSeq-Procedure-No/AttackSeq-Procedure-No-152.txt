1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
     2. Initial Access: TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
     3. Execution: TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
     4. Persistence: TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework for persistence.
     5. Privilege Escalation: TG1021 employed various techniques for privilege escalation.
     6. Defense Evasion: TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded detection.
     7. Credential Access: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
     8. Discovery: TG1021 used offensive security tools to gather information.
     9. Command and Control: TG1021 established command and control on the affected host.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
     2. TG1021 gathered output files during the Discovery phase.
     3. The question asks if TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the abuse of an AD FS server's SAML token. However, it does describe TG1021's tactics and techniques, which can be used to infer the likelihood of such an action.
   - TG1021 has shown a pattern of using sophisticated tools and techniques that are often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs). This includes the use of memory-resident malware, custom tools for privilege escalation, and efforts to evade detection.
   - The question asks if TG1021 would abuse an AD FS server's SAML token, which is a form of credential access and lateral movement. Given the context of the attack and the tactics used by TG1021, it is plausible that they would attempt to abuse such a token for lateral movement within the network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: TG1021 has already shown the ability to exploit vulnerabilities and execute sophisticated malware, indicating a high level of sophistication.
   - Step 2: The use of offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit suggests a targeted and methodical approach to reconnaissance.
   - Step 3: The fact that TG1021 has gathered output files and deleted them indicates a desire to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - Step 4: The absence of a direct mention of AD FS server abuse does not negate the possibility, as TG1021 has shown a pattern of using advanced techniques that could include such actions.
   - Final Answer: Given the context and the tactics used by TG1021, it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
