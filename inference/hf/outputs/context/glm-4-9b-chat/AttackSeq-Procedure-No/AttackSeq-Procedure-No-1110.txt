Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using CVE-2011-0611 to infect victims.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to maintain presence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Collection: The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches for files on removable drives.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: Collected information is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will enumerate Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention any specific actions related to enumerating Azure AD users. The sequence of TTPs provided in the outline does not include any steps that would lead to the conclusion that CosmicDuke would enumerate Azure AD users before collecting information.
- The sequence of TTPs in the outline is as follows:
  1. Initial Access
  2. Execution
  3. Persistence
  4. Credential Access
  5. Collection
  6. Command and Control
  7. Exfiltration

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not include any mention of Azure AD user enumeration or any other action that would suggest this is a part of CosmicDuke's discovery operations before collecting information.
- The sequence of TTPs does not align with the question's assumption that Azure AD user enumeration would occur before the collection phase.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is not likely that CosmicDuke would enumerate Azure AD users before collecting information.

Final Answer: B: No
