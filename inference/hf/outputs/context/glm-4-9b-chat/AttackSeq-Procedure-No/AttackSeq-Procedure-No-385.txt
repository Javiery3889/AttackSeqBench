Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe. RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output, differing from the other backdoors by installing persistently and communicating over DNS rather than HTTP.
- Persistence: The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
- Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which facilitated further actions within the network.
- Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
- Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
- Collection: APT15 used tools like CSVDE to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory and BCP from Microsoft SQL to export data from databases. They also used bespoke tools to extract information from Microsoft Sharepoint and Microsoft Exchange, with the Sharepoint tool containing hardcoded project names specific to the victim.
- Others: NCC Group tracked APT15's movements over more than a year by decoding over 200 commands from several compromised hosts. Ahmed Zaki, a senior malware researcher at NCC Group, highlighted the sophistication of APT15 and the importance of knowledge sharing in the security industry. The article was published on 10 March 2018.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Execution (Deployment of backdoors)
2. Defense Evasion (Bypassing command prompt policy settings)
3. Persistence (Installation of RoyalDNS backdoor)
4. Privilege Escalation (Use of Mimikatz for domain administrator credentials)
5. Credential Access (Stolen VPN certificate for remote access)
6. Collection (Data exfiltration using various tools)

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely after deploying backdoors and leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS)
2. Bypassing command prompt policy settings (using RoyalCLI)
3. Use of Mimikatz for domain administrator credentials
4. Stealing a VPN certificate for remote access

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence from the CTI outline matches the sequence in the question, with the exception of the order of Privilege Escalation and Credential Access. However, the outline clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials (Privilege Escalation) and stole a VPN certificate (Credential Access) after deploying the backdoors and using RoyalCLI to bypass policy settings.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that APT15 deployed the backdoors, used RoyalCLI to bypass policy settings, and then used Mimikatz for domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate. This sequence aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is that it is likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
