1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information for potential exploitation.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
     4. Persistence: Rising Sun ensures persistence on the system by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     5. Discovery: Rising Sun performs initial reconnaissance by fetching system and network information.
     6. Exfiltration: Rising Sun encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.
     2. Communication to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.
     3. Exfiltration of data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests, not through the Jabber/XMPP protocol.
   - The outline does not mention any communication with servers operated by Google or any other specific service for command and control (C2) purposes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline specifies that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data using HTTP POST requests, which is a common method for exfiltration but not necessarily indicative of the C2 protocol used.
   - Step 2: The question asks if the implant will communicate with Google servers using the Jabber/XMPP protocol, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the C2 protocol used by the Rising Sun implant, we cannot conclude that it communicates with Google servers using the Jabber/XMPP protocol.
   - Step 4: The exfiltration method (HTTP POST requests) does not align with the Jabber/XMPP protocol mentioned in the question.

Final Answer: B: No
