Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb' to gain initial access.
- Execution: Macro content in Excel file enables, message appears and disappears, Macro code creates a PE file, PE file is saved and executed using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32.
- Command and Control: Communication with a Kuwait-based IP address over port 443 using an expired digital certificate, specific HTTP communication pattern.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Gholee malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software after executing the concatenated PE file.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the sequence of events leading up to the execution of the PE file, which includes the initial access via a spear phishing attack, the execution of the PE file using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32, and the establishment of command and control communication.
- The outline does not explicitly mention any obfuscation or mechanisms to hide from sandbox software before the execution of the PE file. However, it does mention that the Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection, which suggests a form of obfuscation.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access and execution phases are described, but the specific TTPs related to obfuscation and sandbox evasion are not detailed until the command and control phase.
- The question asks if the malware employs these TTPs after the execution of the PE file. Since the outline does not provide information on obfuscation or sandbox evasion before the execution of the PE file, we cannot definitively conclude that these mechanisms are employed only after the execution.
- However, the fact that the malware uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection suggests that it may have some form of obfuscation, which could be part of a broader strategy to evade detection, including sandbox software.

Final Answer: A: Yes
