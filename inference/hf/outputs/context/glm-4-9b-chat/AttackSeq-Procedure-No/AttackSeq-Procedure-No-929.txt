1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Emissary Panda used tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
     2. Initial Access: Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
     3. Execution: The threat actors uploaded tools and custom backdoors to the compromised servers.
     4. Persistence: The actors installed webshells for persistence.
     5. Defense Evasion: Emissary Panda used webshells to upload legitimate executables and maintain access.
     6. Discovery: The threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance.
     7. Lateral Movement: Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.
     8. Command and Control: The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using Mimikatz to dump credentials for further network access.
     2. Performing network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the initial access was gained by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells. After gaining access, the actors uploaded tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors, indicating that they were actively working within the network.
   - The outline also states that the threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance, which is a step that comes after initial access and before lateral movement. This suggests that the reconnaissance was part of the process to identify vulnerable systems and facilitate lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance only after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells. Given the sequence of events in the outline, it is plausible that the reconnaissance was conducted after the initial access was achieved.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Initial access was gained by exploiting CVE-2019-0604.
   - Step 2: Tools like Mimikatz were used for credential dumping, indicating further network access.
   - Step 3: Network reconnaissance was performed to identify vulnerable systems.
   - Step 4: The sequence of events in the outline suggests that reconnaissance was conducted after initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
