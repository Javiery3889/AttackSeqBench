1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: DLL side-loading is used to execute malicious code.
     2. Defense Evasion: DLL side-loading is used as a defense evasion technique, involving a clean loader to load a malicious DLL.
     3. Command and Control: The final payload establishes a remote command shell to communicate with a command and control server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Deploying a final payload that establishes a remote command shell.
     2. Exfiltrating data over the same channel used for C2.
     3. Configuring systems for exfiltration by creating a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of a remote command shell for command and control communication, which is the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention exfiltration over the same channel or the creation of a desktop.ini file for mimicking a 'Recycle Bin' folder. However, it does describe the use of a sophisticated installer and the assignment of 'hidden' and 'system' attributes to files, which could be part of a broader strategy to prepare for exfiltration.
   - The answer choices are:
     A: Yes
     B: No

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide explicit evidence that the APT group will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 or that they will create a desktop.ini file to mimic a 'Recycle Bin' folder.
   - While the outline does mention steps to conceal the malware and prepare file space for data collection, it does not specify the method of exfiltration or the use of a desktop.ini file.
   - Given the lack of direct evidence in the outline, we cannot definitively conclude that the APT group will follow the sequence of TTPs described in the question.

Final Answer: B: No
