1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Patchwork conducted spear phishing campaigns targeting US-based think tanks.
     2. Initial Access: The threat actors used spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
     3. Persistence: QuasarRAT creates a directory and unpacks the binary, then uses a signed DLL to create a scheduled task for persistence.
     4. Command and Control: The malware beacons to a command and control server to report its presence and receive instructions.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report.
     2. They receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents.
     3. The RTF documents exploit CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.
     4. The question asks if this sequence happens only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access phase involves sending spear phishing emails with RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT. This means that the delivery of the RTF documents and the exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 occur before the infection with QuasarRAT.
   - The question asks if the recipients receive the spear phishing emails containing the RTF documents only after getting infected with QuasarRAT. According to the CTI outline, this is not the case; the infection with QuasarRAT is the result of the initial access phase, not the cause of it.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access phase involves the delivery of the RTF documents as part of the spear phishing campaign.
   - Step 2: The exploitation of CVE-2017-8750 is part of the initial access phase and is used to deliver QuasarRAT.
   - Step 3: The infection with QuasarRAT is the outcome of the initial access phase, not the cause.
   - Step 4: Therefore, the recipients receive the spear phishing emails and are infected with QuasarRAT before they receive the RTF documents.

Final Answer: B: No
