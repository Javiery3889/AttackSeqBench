1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: T1569.002 (execute via a service), T1106 (use the CreateProcessA API for file execution)
     2. Persistence: T1543.003 (create a new service to establish persistence)
     3. Defense Evasion: T1140 (decrypt strings and components), T1070.006 (timestomp files), T1036.004 (masquerade tasks or services), T1112 (modify the registry to store configuration), T1027 (encrypted strings and components)
     4. Discovery: T1083 (obtain file and directory listings), T1057 (list running processes), T1082 (obtain system information), T1016 (obtain local IP address), T1124 (system time and time zone)
     5. Collection: T1560.002 (compress files with zlib before sending to C&C), T1005 (collect files from the computer), T1025 (notify C&C about newly inserted removable media and collect files from them)
     6. Command and Control: T1573.001 (encrypt C&C traffic using XOR), T1573.002 (communicate with C&C via Tor), T1041 (exfiltrate data to the C&C server)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Collection: T1560.002 (compress files with zlib for collection)
     2. Exfiltration: Dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention dividing files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic. However, it does mention that Vyveva's backdoor can compress files with zlib before sending them to the C&C server (T1560.002).
   - The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. This is not directly supported by the CTI outline, as the outline only states that files are compressed using zlib, not divided.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the relevant TTPs from the CTI outline related to file compression and exfiltration.
   - Step 2: Note that the CTI outline only mentions compression using zlib, not file division.
   - Step 3: Evaluate the question's assumption that file division is part of the exfiltration process.
   - Step 4: Conclude that the CTI outline does not provide evidence to support the assumption that Vyveva divides files based on size.

Final Answer: B: No
