1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
     2. Execution: Custom loader executes the Korplug variant.
     3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence on the system.
     4. Defense Evasion: Use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
     5. Discovery: Korplug collects extensive information about the system.
     6. Collection: Korplug collects data from local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     7. Command and Control: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Data exfiltration over TCP using a custom protocol.
     2. Data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that Korplug performs data discovery by collecting extensive information about the system, including system locale, hostname, IP addresses, and uptime. It also collects data from local system, removable media, and network shared drives, which includes listing files and directories along with their attributes and content, and collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - The question asks if Korplug is likely to perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that data discovery occurs after data exfiltration, but it does state that Korplug collects data from all mapped drives as part of its Collection phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Korplug is known to collect data from the local system, including mapped drives, as part of its Collection phase.
   - Step 2: The question asks if Korplug is likely to perform data discovery after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP. Since data discovery is part of the Collection phase, and the Collection phase involves collecting data from mapped drives, it is reasonable to infer that data discovery is a part of Korplug's behavior.
   - Step 3: The question does not specify that data discovery must occur immediately after data exfiltration, but rather that it is a likely behavior of Korplug.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
