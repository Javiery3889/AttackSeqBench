1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Yellow Garuda uses spoofing and Android malware.
     2. Initial Access: Uses macro-enabled template files for initial access.
     3. Persistence: Macro-enabled template files replace the default Microsoft Word template.
     4. Defense Evasion: Uses RC4-encrypted strings and remote infrastructure for decryption keys.
     5. Credential Access: Uses phishing and a Telegram 'grabber' tool for credential harvesting.
     6. Collection: Collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from Telegram accounts.
     7. Others: OPSEC mistakes have led to the disclosure of tools and procedures.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Yellow Garuda collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts using the Telegram 'grabber' tool.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention how the data are exfiltrated after collection. However, it does mention that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format, and that the tool allows the threat actor to delete messages from the victim's account.
   - The question asks if the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection. This is a specific method of exfiltration that is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide information on the method of exfiltration after data collection.
   - Step 2: The question asks about a specific exfiltration method (fixed-size chunks) that is not detailed in the outline.
   - Step 3: Without explicit information on the exfiltration method from the CTI outline, we cannot confirm or deny the use of fixed-size chunks based on the provided data.

Final Answer: B: No

The CTI outline does not provide enough information to confirm that the data are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.
