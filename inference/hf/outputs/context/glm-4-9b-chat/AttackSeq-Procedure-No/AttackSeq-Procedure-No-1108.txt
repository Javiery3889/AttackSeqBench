Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an updated version used starting in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence on the system.
- Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Discovery: The malware searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
- Collection: The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches removable drives for files.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltration and updates.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2 during the Exfiltration phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.
- The question is asking if the same channels (HTTP GET requests, FTP, and WebDav) are used for exfiltration during the Collection phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not specify whether the same channels are used for exfiltration during the Collection phase as they are for Command and Control during the Exfiltration phase.
- However, it is common for malware to use the same channels for both exfiltration and Command and Control to maintain consistency and avoid detection.
- Therefore, based on the common practice in malware operations and the lack of specific information to the contrary in the CTI outline, it is plausible that CosmicDuke would use the same channels for exfiltration during the Collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
