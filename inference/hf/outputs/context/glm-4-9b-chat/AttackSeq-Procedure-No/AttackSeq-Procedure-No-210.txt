1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability, deployed a backdoor, and used a stolen digital certificate.
     2. Initial Access: Exploited Log4Shell vulnerability to spawn PowerShell processes and install a malicious DLL.
     3. Execution: Execution of PowerShell scripts and batch file to download and run additional files (syn.exe and 1.dll).
     4. Persistence: Milestone backdoor installed and created a service for persistence.
     5. Privilege Escalation: Created a new administrator user and executed another instance of itself.
     6. Defense Evasion: Used a kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
     7. Discovery: Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery and screen capture.
     8. Exfiltration: Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. System information discovery and screen capture capabilities.
     2. Communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port.
     3. Exfiltration through the same C2 channel.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a non-standard port for C2 communication. However, it does state that the Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel, which implies that communication with the C2 server is part of the attack's exfiltration phase.
   - The use of system information discovery and screen capture capabilities is mentioned in the Discovery phase of the attack, which is a precursor to exfiltration.
   - Given that the Milestone backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data, it is plausible that it would communicate with a C2 server to do so. The use of a non-standard port could be a method to evade detection, as it is a common technique used by malware to avoid standard port scans and firewalls.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Milestone backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data, which requires communication with a C2 server.
   - Step 2: The backdoor has the capability for system information discovery and screen capture, which are often used to gather information before exfiltration.
   - Step 3: The use of a non-standard port for C2 communication is a plausible method to evade detection, as it is a common technique used by malware.
   - Step 4: Based on the information provided, it is likely that the Milestone backdoor would communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
