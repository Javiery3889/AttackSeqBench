1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Install additional persistence points on new systems
     2. Exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement
     3. Gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to the mission through the discovery phase

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline suggests that the discovery phase comes before the collection phase, which is logical as it involves exploring the target network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - The question asks if the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement after installing additional persistence points and before gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data. According to the outline, the discovery phase precedes the collection phase, which implies that the attackers would need to discover the systems, users, and data before they can effectively exploit remote services for lateral movement.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial installation of persistence points is part of the persistence phase.
   - Step 2: The exploitation of remote services for lateral movement is a tactic that can occur after persistence has been established.
   - Step 3: The discovery phase is a prerequisite for understanding the target environment, which is necessary for effective lateral movement.
   - Step 4: The collection phase follows discovery, where the attackers gather relevant data.
   - Step 5: Based on the sequence in the CTI outline, the discovery phase should occur before the collection phase, and the installation of persistence points should be followed by the discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
