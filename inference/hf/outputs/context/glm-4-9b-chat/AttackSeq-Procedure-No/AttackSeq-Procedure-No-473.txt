1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, replacing the legitimate netd and inheriting root privileges.
     2. Persistence: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd to persist on the system.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel executes shell scripts as the root user.
     4. Defense Evasion: The malware ensures it is run as intended by checking execution context.
     5. Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes credentials and deploys tcpdump for network traffic monitoring.
     6. Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and performs IP scanning.
     7. Collection: Infamous Chisel collects files from local system directories based on a predefined list.
     8. Exfiltration: Infamous Chisel exfiltrates files using Tor and SSH connections.
     9. Impact: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd, impacting the service.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Leveraging Command and Control capabilities (SCP functionality, local Socks connection, SSH server and client).
     2. Performing discovery activities (enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if, after leveraging its Command and Control capabilities, Infamous Chisel is likely to perform discovery activities like enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning with the netd component.
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the netd component of Infamous Chisel is responsible for discovery activities, including enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Infamous Chisel has the capability to perform discovery activities as part of its netd component.
   - Step 2: The question specifies that Infamous Chisel has already leveraged its Command and Control capabilities, which are separate from the discovery activities.
   - Step 3: The discovery activities are a function of the netd component, which is part of the malware's persistence mechanism.
   - Step 4: Since the netd component is designed to perform discovery activities, it is likely that Infamous Chisel will perform these activities after establishing Command and Control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
