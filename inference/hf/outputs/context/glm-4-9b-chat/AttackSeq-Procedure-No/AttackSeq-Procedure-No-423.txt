1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     2. Initial Access: Phishing emails deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware through the execution of VBS macros.
     3. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, downloads payloads using .Net Webclient, and executes files without saving them to disk.
     4. Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
     5. Impact: GandCrab ransomware encrypts files, and Ursnif performs credential harvesting and system information gathering.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial access through phishing emails with a malicious Word document.
     2. Execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. Retrieval of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the attack sequence starting with phishing emails delivering a malicious Word document with embedded macros. The PowerShell script is executed by the VBS macro, which is part of the initial access phase. The script then downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes, the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - Answer Choice B: No, the encoded PowerShell script will not execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with embedded macros.
   - Step 2: The VBS macro is executed, which is part of the initial access phase.
   - Step 3: The PowerShell script is executed by the VBS macro.
   - Step 4: The PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - Step 5: The sequence described in the question matches the sequence in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
