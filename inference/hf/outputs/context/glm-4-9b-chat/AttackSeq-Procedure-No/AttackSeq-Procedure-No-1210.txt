1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory, bypassing disk-based detection.
     - Persistence: Turla uses WMI event subscriptions and modifies the PowerShell profile for persistence.
     - Defense Evasion: Turla scripts encrypt payloads, obfuscate scripts, and bypass AMSI.
     - Discovery: Turla uses RPC backdoor and PowerStallion for lateral movement and control.
     - Collection: RPC backdoor plugins collect files, and PowerStallion uses OneDrive for command and control.
     - Command and Control: RPC backdoor uses RPC protocol, PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Command and Control: PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control server.
     - Exfiltration: The method by which PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive as its command and control server, accessed via SMB.
   - The question asks if PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS after using OneDrive as the command and control channel.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline specifies that PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive for command and control, which is accessed via SMB.
   - Step 2: The question asks about the method of exfiltration, which is a separate TTP from command and control.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline does not provide specific information about the exfiltration method used by PowerStallion.
   - Step 4: Since the CTI outline does not specify the exfiltration method, we cannot definitively conclude that PowerStallion will use HTTPS for exfiltration based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
