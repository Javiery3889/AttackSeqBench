Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The T9000 malware is delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
- Execution: The malware uses a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL and performs security product checks.
- Persistence: T9000 establishes persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll into the explorer.exe process.
- Defense Evasion: The malware customizes its installation to avoid detection and uses mutexes and named events.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
- Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates various types of data, including Skype communications.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if T9000 is likely to establish persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for constant execution after capturing audio from Skype users.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that T9000 establishes persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll into the explorer.exe process. This is a direct match with the TTPs mentioned in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs described in the CTI outline include the specific actions of modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll into explorer.exe, which are mentioned in the question as methods of establishing persistence.
- Since the TTPs from the outline match the actions described in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that T9000 would use these methods to establish persistence after capturing audio from Skype users.

Final Answer: A: Yes
