Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
  2. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with exploits for CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352, and watering hole attacks.
  3. Execution: Backdoor used by Dropping Elephant is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
  4. Defense Evasion: The backdoor uses encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to evade detection.
  5. Collection: File-stealer module collects specific files and uploads them to the C2 server.
  6. Command and Control: Backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, and resilient communications are used to hide the C2 server locations.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Iterating through password stores.
  2. Stealing the user's Google Chrome credentials.
  3. Decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the use of encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts as a Defense Evasion technique. This matches the third TTP mentioned in the question.
- The question asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to evade defenses by using this technique. Since the CTI outline explicitly states that the backdoor uses this method for defense evasion, it is a plausible sequence of TTPs.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that the Dropping Elephant backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection, which is a direct match with the third TTP in the question.
- The backdoor's use of encoded blobs to download additional malware is a well-documented defense evasion technique, as mentioned in the outline.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is that the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
