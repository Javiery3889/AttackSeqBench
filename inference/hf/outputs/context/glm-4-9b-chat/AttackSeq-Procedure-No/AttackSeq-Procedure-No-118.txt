1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: The Tuyul botnet is used to execute commands on victim systems.
     - Persistence: The malware downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
     - Defense Evasion: The malware uses a binary version to go undetected by antivirus engines and employs PHP web shells for access.
     - Command and Control: The botnet uses a specific domain for C&C communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access.
     - Leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
     - Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. However, it does mention that the malware downloads a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Tuyul malware will leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before downloading the 'cron' script. The outline does not provide information about the use of legitimate credentials, but it does indicate that the malware is designed to maintain persistence on the system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide information about the use of legitimate credentials.
   - Step 2: The outline does confirm that the malware maintains persistence by downloading a 'cron' script.
   - Step 3: Since the use of legitimate credentials is not mentioned in the outline, we cannot conclude that it is a part of the Tuyul malware's behavior based on the provided information.
   - Step 4: Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the outline does not include leveraging legitimate credentials.

Final Answer: B: No
