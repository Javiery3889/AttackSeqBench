Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a spear-phishing email that spoofs a Russian state corporation, Rostec, to deliver a malicious PDF file that appears to be a legitimate document.
- Persistence: The dropper executable hides the encrypted malware and a decoy file within its body, decrypts the malware using RC4 with a specific key, and creates a registry entry to ensure persistence upon reboot.
- Defense Evasion: The malware uses a different cipher (RC4) for C2 communication than documented samples and communicates with hardcoded C2 addresses using HTTP POST on TCP port 443.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Bisonal variant will use steganography to hide its C2 communications after setting up persistence.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention steganography as a method used by the Bisonal malware. The focus is on the use of RC4 for encryption and the creation of a registry entry for persistence.
- The question specifically asks about the use of steganography for C2 communications. Since the outline does not provide any information about steganography being used by Bisonal, we cannot conclude that it is a plausible TTP based on the given information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any evidence that the Bisonal variant uses steganography for C2 communications.
- The absence of information about steganography in the outline means we cannot confirm that it is a TTP of the Bisonal malware.

Final Answer: B: No
