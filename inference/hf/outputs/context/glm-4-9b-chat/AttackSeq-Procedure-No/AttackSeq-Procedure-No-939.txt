Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Reconnaissance: The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, suggesting advanced reconnaissance capabilities.
- Resource Development: The APT has the ability to compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintains a dynamic infrastructure.
- Initial Access: The APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates.
- Execution: The APT deploys various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and uses 0-day exploits.
- Persistence: The APT maintains persistence on compromised systems through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
- Defense Evasion: The APT uses digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypts data in log files.
- Credential Access: The APT's information stealer module targets stored secrets in browsers and email services, and it terminates itself on Windows systems with the default codepage set to Korean.
- Command and Control: The APT maintains a web interface for victim management and encrypts victim data on their servers.
- Others: The APT is known for its long-term activity and sophisticated espionage tools, targeting top executives during their stays.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if The Darkhotel APT is likely to gain victim credentials after deploying a keylogger module.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: deploying a keylogger module, encrypting and storing gathered data, and using an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the Darkhotel APT deploys keyloggers and information stealers as part of their attack sequence.
- The information stealer module is designed to target stored secrets in browsers and email services, which aligns with the question's mention of using the module to target stored secrets.
- The outline does not explicitly state that the APT encrypts data before using the information stealer module, but it does mention that they encrypt data in log files using algorithms similar to RC4, which could be part of their broader data exfiltration strategy.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Darkhotel APT is known to deploy keyloggers and information stealers, which are tools used to capture credentials.
- The APT's information stealer module is designed to target stored secrets, which includes credentials.
- Although the outline does not explicitly state that the APT encrypts data before using the information stealer module, the fact that they use encryption techniques suggests they are likely to encrypt data to evade detection.
- Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the APT would use the information stealer module to gain victim credentials after deploying the keylogger module.

Final Answer: A: Yes
