1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spam emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     2. Execution: The document drops a JS file that executes in the background.
     3. Persistence: The JS file creates a copy of itself in the Startup folder.
     4. Defense Evasion: Trickbot checks the total number of running processes to evade detection.
     5. Collection: Trickbot uses a PoS module and a proxy module.
     6. Command and Control: The malware connects to a URL to download its payload.
     7. Impact: Trickbot deletes files with specific extensions and replaces them with malware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Trickbot targets applications like Filezilla and Microsoft Outlook.
     2. Trickbot checks the total number of running processes to evade detection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that Trickbot exhibits anti-analysis characteristics by checking the total number of running processes on the victim's machine to evade detection. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The first TTP in the question (targeting applications like Filezilla and Microsoft Outlook) is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a known behavior of Trickbot as a banking trojan.
   - Therefore, the answer to whether Trickbot will check the total number of running processes after targeting these applications is supported by the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that Trickbot checks the total number of running processes as part of its Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Step 2: The question asks if Trickbot will check the total number of running processes after targeting specific applications, which is a behavior consistent with its Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline supports the behavior described in the question, the answer choice that aligns with the attack sequence is the correct one.

Final Answer: A: Yes
