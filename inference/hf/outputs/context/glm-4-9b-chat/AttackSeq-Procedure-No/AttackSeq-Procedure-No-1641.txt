Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying, access to remote services, information gathering from cloud resources.
- Execution: Installation of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, scheduled tasks for batch-file execution.
- Persistence: Loading beacon in memory without persistence, installing beacon on high uptime systems, searching for VPN and firewall configs.
- Privilege Escalation: Password spraying against domain admin accounts, using NtdsAudit and other tools.
- Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces, using timestomping and Windows event logs clearing.
- Credential Access: Brute force credential access, credential stuffing or password spraying.
- Discovery: Using PsLogList and other tools for account discovery and identifying privileged users.
- Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's lateral movement capabilities, moving to domain controllers, and discovering data of interest.
- Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike for C2, switching protocols over time, using a cracked/patched trial version.
- Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data using Cobalt Strike's C2 channel, using a custom tool for large data exfiltration to cloud storage.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the adversary will perform lateral movement to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on newly compromised systems and identify data of interest through further discovery before collecting data from information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online after exfiltrating staged and compressed data to cloud storage.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the adversary has already performed lateral movement (using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities) and discovery (using tools like PsLogList) to identify data of interest.
- The outline also shows that the adversary has used Cobalt Strike for command and control and exfiltration purposes, which suggests a pattern of using Cobalt Strike for these activities.
- The question asks if the adversary will continue this pattern after exfiltrating data to cloud storage.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The adversary has shown a pattern of using Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery, which is consistent with the question's scenario.
- The outline does not explicitly state that the adversary will continue this pattern after exfiltration, but given the pattern observed, it is reasonable to infer that they would.
- Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will perform lateral movement to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on newly compromised systems and identify data of interest through further discovery before collecting data from information repositories.

Final Answer: A: Yes
