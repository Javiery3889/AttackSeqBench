Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using CVE-2011-0611 to infect victims.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain presence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Collection: The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches for files on removable drives.
- Command and Control: It communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations only after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer before it searches for files on removable drives. This suggests that the file search operation is part of the collection phase rather than a separate discovery operation.
- The outline does not specify whether CosmicDuke targets non-English filenames specifically. However, it does mention that it searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events in the CTI outline shows that the file search is part of the collection phase, which comes after the initial information gathering with the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- The question asks if the file search is part of discovery operations that target non-English filenames specifically. While the outline does not mention non-English filenames, it does not contradict the idea that the file search is part of the discovery phase.
- Given that the file search is part of the collection phase and the question is asking about discovery operations, it is plausible that the file search could be considered part of discovery, even if the language of the filenames is not specified.

Final Answer: A: Yes
