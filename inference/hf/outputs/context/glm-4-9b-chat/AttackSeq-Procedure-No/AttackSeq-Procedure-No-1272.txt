Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Attackers used SocGholish to deliver malicious JavaScript.
  2. Initial Access: Malicious JavaScript led to the execution of PowerShell scripts.
  3. Execution: Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell, with a .NET injector from Donut.
  4. Privilege Escalation: Used slui.exe and wmic.exe for privilege escalation.
  5. Defense Evasion: Used PsExec to disable Windows Defender and stop services.
  6. Credential Access: Used Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and log file clearing.
  7. Discovery: Used commands and PowerView to profile computers and search Active Directory.
  8. Lateral Movement: Used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.
  9. Command and Control: Communicated with a C&C domain.
  10. Impact: Not explicitly detailed in the outline, but typically involves the ransomware's destructive actions.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Deployment of WastedLocker ransomware using PsExec.
  2. Disabling Windows Defender and stopping services during Defense Evasion.
  3. Deleting system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies. However, it does describe the Defense Evasion phase, where PsExec is used to stop services and disable Windows Defender.
- It is common for ransomware to delete system volume shadow copies to prevent victims from restoring their files from backups. This is a typical action in the Impact phase of a ransomware attack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies, but it is a common ransomware tactic.
- Given the typical behavior of ransomware and the actions taken by the attackers in the Defense Evasion phase, it is reasonable to infer that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies.
- Final Answer: A: Yes
