Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with malicious delivery documents in the Tajik language targeting government and telecommunication organizations.
- Execution: The payload executes, creating files in the ProgramData directory, and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script. The VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- Persistence: The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.
- Defense Evasion: The campaign uses obfuscation and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
- Discovery: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- Collection: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots and sends this data to a C&C server.
- Others: The attackers monitor the C&C server and use false flags in the PowerShell script.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel only before collecting machine information and taking screenshots.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention that the communication with the C&C server is encrypted. However, it does mention that the PowerShell script sends collected data to a C&C server, which implies that there is some form of communication with the server.
- The outline also mentions that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C server, which suggests that the communication is likely secure to some extent to prevent detection.
- The presence of false flags in the PowerShell script indicates that the attackers are aware of the importance of securing their communication channels.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the encryption of the communication channel used by the backdoor.
- However, given the context that the attackers are actively monitoring the C&C server and the use of false flags, it is reasonable to infer that the communication is likely encrypted to maintain security.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor communicates with the C&C server via an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
