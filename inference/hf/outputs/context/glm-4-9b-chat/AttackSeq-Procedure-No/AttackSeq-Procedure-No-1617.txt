1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Defense Evasion
     5. Credential Access
     6. Discovery
     7. Command and Control
     8. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Monitoring network traffic
     2. Sniffing low-level network traffic
     3. Gathering information on processes and memory utilization
     4. Scanning for deleted files
   - These TTPs are associated with the Discovery phase of the attack.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The Discovery phase is described in the CTI outline as involving:
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization
     - Scanning for deleted files
   - The question asks if Regin is likely to perform these actions during the Discovery phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Discovery phase is where a threat actor gathers information about the target environment.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline explicitly states that Regin's discovery capabilities include gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.
   - Step 3: The question's TTPs align with the Discovery phase's activities as described in the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Since the TTPs in the question match the activities of the Discovery phase as outlined in the CTI report, it is reasonable to conclude that Regin would perform these actions during the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
