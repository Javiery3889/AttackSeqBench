Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Konni APT Group delivers an ISO file with a zip file containing malicious scripts.
- Execution: VBScripts and batch files are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'resolve.dns', 'update.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
- Defense Evasion: Scripts are obfuscated and 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution.
- Discovery: 'versioninfo.bat' discovers information about the user's computer.
- Collection: 'versioninfo.bat' collects information for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with a C2 server.
- Exfiltration: 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrate data.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if 'stopedge.bat' will manage the deletion of files such as 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' as a means of defense evasion after scheduling the periodic execution of 'install.vbs'.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that 'stopedge.bat' manages the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution, which is mentioned under the Defense Evasion section. This deletion is an example of defense evasion through indicator removal.
- The question is asking if this deletion is likely, which aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that 'stopedge.bat' is responsible for deleting 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution, which is a form of defense evasion.
- Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that 'stopedge.bat' will manage the deletion of these files as a means of defense evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
