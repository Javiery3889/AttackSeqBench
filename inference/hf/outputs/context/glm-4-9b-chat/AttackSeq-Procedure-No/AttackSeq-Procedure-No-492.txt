Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The Harvester group initiates the campaign with an unknown initial infection vector.
- Execution: Deployment of Backdoor.Graphon, a custom downloader, and a custom screenshot tool.
- Persistence: The custom downloader creates a registry value for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: The group uses legitimate infrastructure for C&C activities and a decoy URL.
- Collection: The custom screenshot tool captures screenshots and saves them to a password-protected ZIP archive.
- Exfiltration: The custom screenshot tool saves captured screenshots to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.
- Others: The campaign is an espionage effort, and Symantec's Threat Hunter Team is investigating.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Collection
6. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of FTP protocol for C2 communication. It does state that the group used legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities, which suggests a preference for more sophisticated and less common protocols or methods for C2 communication.
- The use of FTP for C2 communication is not typical for sophisticated threat actors like the Harvester group, as it is a protocol that can be easily detected and blocked by security systems.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of FTP for C2 communication.
- The Harvester group is known for using sophisticated methods, which typically do not include the use of FTP for C2.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon would utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication.

Final Answer: B: No
