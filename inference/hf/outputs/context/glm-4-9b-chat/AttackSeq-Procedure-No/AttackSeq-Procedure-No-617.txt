Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Reconnaissance: The attack is aimed at cryptocurrency and financial organizations, with a focus on the Turkish financial system and SWIFT network.
- Initial Access: Financial organizations in Turkey are targeted via spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
- Execution: The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document, which is a document template for Bitcoin distribution.
- Persistence: Bankshot is designed to persist on the network for further exploitation.
- Defense Evasion: The implant contains functionality to wipe files and content from the system to erase evidence.
- Command and Control: The implants communicate with hardcoded control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.
- Others: The campaign targets unpatched Flash versions, and the Bankshot malware is known for its destructive capabilities.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial access to the Turkish financial organizations was gained through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploited CVE-2018-4878.
- The question is asking if this is a plausible sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for Hidden Cobra.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that Hidden Cobra has indeed used spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document exploiting CVE-2018-4878 to gain initial access to Turkish financial organizations.
- The question asks if this is a likely sequence, and based on the information provided, it is a plausible sequence as it matches the observed attack pattern.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is that it is likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations using this method.

Final Answer: A: Yes
