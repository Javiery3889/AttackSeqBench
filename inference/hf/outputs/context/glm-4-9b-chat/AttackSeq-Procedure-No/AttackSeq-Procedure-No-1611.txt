1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The campaign targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions and is linked to another campaign targeting users from Brazil's banking institutions.
     2. Initial Access: The attack begins with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria (SAT), warning of a pending tax return.
     3. Execution: The email includes a link to download a malicious attachment, COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip, containing the malicious file COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat.
     4. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
     5. Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer.
     6. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts.
     7. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download the malware and send collected data.
     8. Exfiltration: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated through a POST web request.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Accessing victim's Outlook information to collect email accounts.
     2. Displaying text related to an alleged data update request.
     3. Executing a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level.
     4. Enabling persistence through creating shortcuts and manipulating scheduled tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, which includes the initial access via an email impersonating a tax department, the execution of a malicious batch file, the use of PowerShell to run a script at memory level, and the creation of persistence mechanisms.
   - The question asks if the Cosmic Banker malware is likely to target Mexican financial institution users to steal credentials by following the sequence of TTPs mentioned.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is via an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, which is consistent with the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: The email is used to deliver a malicious attachment, which is also consistent with the CTI outline.
   - Step 3: The execution of a malicious batch file to run a PowerShell script at memory level is described in the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: The PowerShell script includes persistence mechanisms, which is also mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question matches the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
