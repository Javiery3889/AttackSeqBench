Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying, accessing remote services, obtaining information from cloud resources.
- Persistence: Loading Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence, installing beacon on systems with high uptimes (servers), searching for VPN and firewall configs.
- Privilege Escalation: Password spraying against domain admin accounts, using NtdsAudit, moving to another system with a domain admin logged in.
- Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces, Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, timestomping.
- Credential Access: Brute force credential access, credential stuffing or password spraying.
- Discovery: Using PsLogList for account discovery, using Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz for credential dumping.
- Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement methods, moving to a domain controller, continuing lateral movement and discovery.
- Collection: Collecting data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, copying results of discovery phase, copying email.
- Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike as a framework, using C2 protocols encapsulated in DNS and HTTPS.
- Exfiltration: Exfiltrating small amounts of data using Cobalt Strike's C2 channel, using a custom tool for large amounts of data to cloud storage services.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that the adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system. However, it also mentions that the adversary is able to have persistent access by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
- The question specifically asks about the use of scheduled tasks to execute the beacon in memory. The outline does not mention the use of scheduled tasks for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide information about the use of scheduled tasks for executing the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory. It only mentions the use of the beacon on systems with high uptimes for persistence.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot conclude that the adversary will rely on scheduled tasks for this purpose.

Final Answer: B: No
