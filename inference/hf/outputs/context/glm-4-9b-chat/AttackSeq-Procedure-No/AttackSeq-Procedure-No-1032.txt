Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with the installation and execution of a Cobalt Strike beacon, which can be a stager or stageless, and communicates with a C&C server using various protocols.
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers use Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz or UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
- Defense Evasion: Cobalt Strike is used to bypass detection, including network packet-based detection systems.
- Discovery: After gaining escalated privileges, attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather information about the network and connected PCs.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if attackers, after gathering Active Directory and network information using ADFind and port scanning, will likely abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that after discovery, attackers are likely to move laterally within the network.
- The question specifically mentions the abuse of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of SAML tokens or AD FS servers in the context of lateral movement, but it does discuss the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and the gathering of information that could be used to facilitate such movement.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The use of ADFind and port scanning indicates that the attackers have gathered detailed information about the network, which could include the presence of an AD FS server.
- Lateral movement often involves moving from one system to another within a network to achieve a specific goal, such as accessing sensitive data or further compromising systems.
- While the CTI outline does not provide explicit details on the use of SAML tokens, it is a known technique that attackers might use to gain unauthorized access to resources within a network.
- Given the context of lateral movement and the information gathered, it is plausible that attackers could abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement.

Final Answer: A: Yes
