Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, including Windows credentials and application-specific credentials.
- Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives with specific patterns.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it's likely that CosmicDuke captures credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the capture of credentials on a manipulated login page.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the manipulation of login pages or the targeting of specific applications like Ivanti Connect Secure. However, it does state that CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, which could include any application that stores credentials.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke is capable of stealing credentials from a variety of applications, which could include Ivanti Connect Secure if it stores credentials.
- While the outline does not mention the specific TTP of manipulating a login page, it does not contradict the possibility either.
- Given that CosmicDuke is designed to steal credentials and the lack of information to the contrary, it is plausible that it could capture credentials from a manipulated login page.

Final Answer: A: Yes
