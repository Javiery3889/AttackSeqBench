Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: BADHATCH backdoor is used to gain initial access.
- Execution: BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode and uses IEX for PowerShell commands.
- Persistence: BADHATCH uses WMI event subscription for persistence.
- Privilege Escalation: Privilege escalation is involved, likely using the SYSTEM token.
- Defense Evasion: BADHATCH uses TLS encryption and masquerades as legitimate HTTP requests.
- Credential Access: Credential dumping is suggested by the execution of a script named mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
- Lateral Movement: Lateral movement to the Domain Controller is achieved using wmic.exe.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and read the memory of lsass.exe after system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that credential dumping is suggested by the execution of a script named mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz. This aligns with the question's mention of credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz.
- The outline also mentions that the PowerShell process reads the memory of lsass.exe, which is a common target for credential dumping. This is consistent with the question's statement about reading the memory of lsass.exe.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that the attackers are using a method that is consistent with the question's description of credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and reading the memory of lsass.exe.
- The sequence of TTPs in the outline includes credential access as a step in the attack, which is directly related to the question's scenario.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is plausible that the attackers will perform the described credential dumping after system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery.

Final Answer: A: Yes
