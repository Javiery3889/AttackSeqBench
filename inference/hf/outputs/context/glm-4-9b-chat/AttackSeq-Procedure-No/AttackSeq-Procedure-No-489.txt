1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
     2. Initial Access: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access.
     3. Execution: Utilizing cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor, and executing SparrowDoor on compromised systems.
     4. Persistence: Creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service, using DLL search order hijacking.
     5. Defense Evasion: Injecting encrypted shellcode, adjusting token privileges, and obfuscating files or information.
     6. Discovery: Collecting system information and probing files in specified directories.
     7. Collection: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
     8. Command and Control: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
     9. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Credential Access: Dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.
     2. Discovery: Collecting system information and probing files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Mimikatz for Credential Access. However, it does describe the Discovery phase, which includes collecting system information and probing files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide information on the use of Mimikatz for Credential Access, so we cannot confirm that this is part of the attack sequence.
   - Step 2: The Discovery phase is described as collecting system information and probing files, which is consistent with the question's description of the TTPs.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not mention Mimikatz, we cannot conclude that the Discovery phase follows Credential Access as described in the question.
   - Step 4: The question asks if it is "likely" that the Discovery phase follows Credential Access, which is not confirmed by the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
