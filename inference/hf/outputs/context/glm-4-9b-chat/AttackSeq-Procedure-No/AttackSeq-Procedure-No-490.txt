1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
     2. Initial Access: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain access.
     3. Execution: Utilizing cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor, and executing SparrowDoor on compromised systems.
     4. Persistence: Creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service, using DLL search order hijacking.
     5. Defense Evasion: Injecting encrypted shellcode, adjusting token privileges, and obfuscating files or information.
     6. Discovery: Collecting system information and probing files.
     7. Collection: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
     8. Command and Control: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
     9. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Stealing application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.
     2. Collecting system information.
     3. Probing files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention phishing emails or stealing application access tokens as part of the attack sequence. The Initial Access phase is described as exploiting known remote code execution vulnerabilities, not phishing.
   - The Discovery phase is described as collecting system information and probing files, which aligns with the second and third TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The absence of phishing emails in the CTI outline suggests that this method was not used by FamousSparrow in the described attack sequence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not include phishing emails as a method for Initial Access.
   - Step 2: The Discovery phase in the CTI outline matches the second and third TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not mention phishing emails, it is unlikely that FamousSparrow used this method before the Discovery phase.

Final Answer: B: No
