1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The IEXPL0RE RAT is delivered via email attachments using social engineering techniques.
     2. Execution: The RAT installs a launcher program on the victim's computer, which then unpacks and runs the actual RAT in memory.
     3. Persistence: The RAT establishes persistence on the system.
     4. Defense Evasion: The RAT uses various techniques to evade detection.
     5. Collection: The RAT records keystrokes and exfiltrates data back to the C2 server.
     6. Command and Control: The RAT has a server component that can block unauthorized access and has over 40 commands for various actions.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure instead of encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods for exfiltration and further instructions.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure. However, it does mention that the server component of the IEXPL0RE RAT has shown different behaviors to block unauthorized access, which could imply the use of alternative methods for communication.
   - The outline also states that the RAT is actively developed and contains over 40 commands for file system and registry manipulation, data exfiltration, and real-time control of the system. This suggests that the threat actor is likely to use sophisticated methods for C2 communication.
   - Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are common and secure for C2 communication, but the question asks if blogs and WordPress are likely to be used instead. Given the sophistication of the IEXPL0RE RAT and the context of the attack, it is plausible that the threat actor might use less common or more隐蔽的方法 for C2 infrastructure.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.
   - Step 2: However, the outline does suggest that the threat actor is sophisticated and likely to use methods that are less common or more隐蔽.
   - Step 3: Encrypted HTTP POST and GET methods are common and may be more easily detected by security measures.
   - Step 4: Given the context and the potential for the threat actor to use sophisticated methods, it is plausible that blogs and WordPress could be used for C2 infrastructure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
