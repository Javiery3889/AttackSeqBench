1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: July to August 2011 (leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability)
     - Credential Access: July to August 2011 (attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains)
     - Persistence: February 2014 (locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems)
     - Command and Control: May 2015 (adopts and customizes several Android backdoors, uses a massive infrastructure)
     - Others: March to August 2013 (attack activity subsides, new domains registered), October 2011 (phishing during the Libyan crisis), June 2012 (flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day), July & October 2015 (new waves of attacks targeting Japanese companies), 2016 (SPEAR believes attacks into Japanese critical infrastructure are ongoing)

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Initial Access: Leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability
     - Credential Access: Harvesting user's login credentials

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains during the Credential Access phase, which occurred after the Initial Access phase in July to August 2011.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. The reconnaissance phase would typically occur before the Credential Access phase, as it is the phase where an attacker gathers information about the target environment.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attack group's Initial Access was achieved through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability in July to August 2011.
   - Step 2: The Credential Access phase followed, where the group attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the group harvested credentials during the reconnaissance phase, which is before Credential Access.
   - Step 4: Since the Credential Access phase is after the Initial Access phase and involves the use of phishing domains, it is not plausible that the group harvested credentials during the reconnaissance phase, as the reconnaissance phase would not involve credential harvesting.

Final Answer: B: No
