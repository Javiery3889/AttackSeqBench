Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Discovery
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration
  12. Others

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery
  2. Using software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement
  3. Collecting data from network shared drives
  4. Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the TTPs used by FIN13 in detail. After the discovery phase, the outline mentions the following TTPs:
  - Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
  - Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
  - Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

- The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data. The CTI outline does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. However, it does mention the use of custom malware for lateral movement (Execution: JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying; Defense Evasion: leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker by FIN13. However, it does describe the use of custom malware and legitimate utilities for lateral movement and defense evasion, which suggests that FIN13 is capable of using such tools for their objectives.
- The question specifically asks about the use of PDQ Deploy, which is a software deployment tool, and the outline does not mention this tool. While it is possible that FIN13 could use similar tools for their operations, the absence of PDQ Deploy in the outline makes it less likely that they would use it specifically.
- The sequence in the question seems to be out of order based on the outline. The outline does not mention the use of software deployment tools before the collection phase.

Final Answer: B: No
