Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Supply chain attack via 3CX software, Smooth Operator malware inserted into dylib, signed by 3CX and notarized by Apple.
- Execution: Smooth Operator executes as part of 3CX software, creates a new thread, uses constructor function.
- Persistence: Smooth Operator persists by abusing libffmpeg.dylib.
- Defense Evasion: Second-stage payload daemonizes, deletes itself, writes to legitimate directory, obfuscates traffic.
- Discovery: Smooth Operator collects information from SystemVersion.plist and config.json.
- Command and Control: Smooth Operator communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS with custom encoding.
- Exfiltration: Smooth Operator exfiltrates data via HTTPS, not over C2 channel.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Smooth Operator is likely to perform HTTPS-based communication with its C2 servers before parsing and extracting domain and account name values from the config.json file during its collection stage.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, which is a part of the Command and Control phase.
- The collection stage involves gathering information from the SystemVersion.plist and config.json files, which is part of the Discovery phase.
- The outline does not specify the exact sequence of these actions but does show that communication with C2 servers is established over HTTPS.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state the sequence of actions in the Discovery phase, but it does show that Smooth Operator communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS.
- It is plausible that Smooth Operator would use HTTPS communication to send the collected information to the C2 server before parsing and extracting additional data from the config.json file.
- Therefore, the sequence of actions could be: collect information, communicate with C2 server (HTTPS), then parse and extract additional data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
