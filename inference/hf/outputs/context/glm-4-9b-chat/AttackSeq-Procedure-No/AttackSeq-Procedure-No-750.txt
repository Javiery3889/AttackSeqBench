1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information for potential exploitation using job recruitment activity.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed via Dropbox and an IP address in the United States, containing a macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
     4. Persistence: Rising Sun ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     5. Discovery: Rising Sun performs initial reconnaissance by fetching system and network details.
     6. Command and Control: Rising Sun communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
     2. Communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
     3. Data exfiltration using GitHub (the question is asking if this is likely).

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention GitHub as a method of data exfiltration. The information provided focuses on the reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, discovery, and command and control phases of the attack.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration after the mentioned TTPs. Since there is no information in the CTI outline about the use of GitHub for data exfiltration, we cannot conclude that it is a plausible method based on the provided data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Identify the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Step 3: Compare the TTPs from the question with the attack sequence in the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the implant using GitHub for data exfiltration based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
