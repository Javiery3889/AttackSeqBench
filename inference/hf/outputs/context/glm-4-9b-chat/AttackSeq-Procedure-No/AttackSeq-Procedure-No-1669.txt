1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
     2. Initial Access: The attackers likely used a spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable to infect the system.
     3. Execution: The malware (TDrop2) executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
     4. Defense Evasion: TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its payload retrieval.
     5. Discovery: The malware performed discovery activities by collecting system and network information.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
     2. Performing discovery activities to collect system and network information.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware performs discovery activities (collecting system and network information) after it has executed and evaded defenses.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities after communicating with C2 servers using a custom base64 alphabet.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The TDrop2 malware is designed to communicate with C2 servers, which is a part of the Execution phase.
   - Step 2: After establishing communication with the C2 server, the malware is likely to execute further commands or actions as directed by the attacker.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline explicitly states that the malware performs discovery activities as part of its behavior.
   - Step 4: Since the discovery activities are part of the malware's behavior and are not dependent on the method of communication with the C2 server, it is reasonable to assume that the malware will perform discovery activities after communicating with the C2 server.

Final Answer: A: Yes
