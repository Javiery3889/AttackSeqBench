Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (OST) like SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
  2. Initial Access: TG1021 gained access to target networks by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
  3. Execution: TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware, referred to as NodeIISWeb.
  4. Persistence: TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework to maintain persistence.
  5. Privilege Escalation: TG1021 employed various techniques, including PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll, for privilege escalation.
  6. Defense Evasion: TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded commercial EDRs.
  7. Credential Access: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
  8. Discovery: TG1021 used offensive security tools to scan and map targets.
  9. Lateral Movement: TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.
  10. Command and Control: TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
  2. TG1021 dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.
  3. TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit during the Reconnaissance phase, which is before the Lateral Movement phase. The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using these tools, which is a part of the Reconnaissance phase.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, as the Discovery phase is part of the Reconnaissance phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit during the Reconnaissance phase, which is consistent with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
- Since the question asks if it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase, and the Discovery phase is part of the Reconnaissance phase, the answer is yes, it is likely that TG1021 performed these actions during the Reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
