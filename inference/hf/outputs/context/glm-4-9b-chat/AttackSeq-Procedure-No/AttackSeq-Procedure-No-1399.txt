Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Discovery
  9. Lateral Movement
  10. Collection
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Exfiltration (over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools)
  2. Use of proxies for communication and command and control

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the sequence of actions taken by FIN13, including the use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration (step 11). It also mentions that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely (step 10) and uses various methods for persistence, including email communications for command and control (step 4).
- The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely. The outline does not explicitly state when FIN13 uses proxies, but it does mention that they use email communications for command and control, which could imply the use of proxies or other communication methods for stealthy operations.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide a clear sequence of when FIN13 uses proxies for communication and command and control. However, it does indicate that they use email communications for command and control, which could involve the use of proxies for stealth.
- Given that the question is about the likelihood of using proxies after exfiltration, and considering that the outline does not specify the timing of proxy usage, it is reasonable to infer that the use of proxies could occur at any stage of the attack, including after the collection and exfiltration of data.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is not definitively "Yes" or "No" based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: The information provided in the CTI outline does not allow for a definitive answer to the question.
