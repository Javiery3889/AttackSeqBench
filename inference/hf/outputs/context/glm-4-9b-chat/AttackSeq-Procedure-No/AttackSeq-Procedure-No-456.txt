Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
- Defense Evasion: APT-TOCS exhibited features designed to evade detection by security software and firewall interception. The attack pattern included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and the use of multi-beacon communication, which could work simultaneously and evade sandbox detection.
- Lateral Movement: APT-TOCS depended on network projection and could laterally move within the internal network as required to conduct an attack.
- Command and Control: APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control. The attack communicated with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests to specific URLs and transmitted heartbeat packages using Cookie fields with 60 seconds intervals.
- Others: APT-TOCS is closely related to the Cobalt Strike automatic attack testing platform. The attack can penetrate firewalls and is undetectable, capable of attacking various platforms, and formidable against Trusted Computing, Cloud Detection, and Sandbox Detection. The threat has been active for 5 years without powerful detection methods to defeat it. The attack is considered an APT due to its targeted nature, anti-detection functions, and ability to conceal itself. The use of a commercial attack platform reduces the cost and complexity of launching such attacks, making it difficult to trace the attackers.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access
2. Defense Evasion
3. Lateral Movement
4. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses during the attack's core step instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. PowerShell scripts running a credential harvesting tool in memory
2. Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the APT-TOCS attack utilized "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems. This suggests that the initial access was achieved through the execution of Shellcode scripts.
- The Defense Evasion section mentions that the attack pattern included running in memory, which could imply that the Shellcode scripts were executed in memory to evade detection.
- The question suggests that PowerShell scripts could have been used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory instead of Shellcode scripts. However, the outline does not provide specific information about the use of PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that PowerShell scripts were used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory. It does mention that Shellcode scripts were executed for remote control, which could imply that they were executed in memory.
- The question asks if it is likely that PowerShell scripts were used for credential harvesting instead of Shellcode scripts. Without explicit information in the outline about the use of PowerShell for credential harvesting, we cannot conclude that this is the case.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence based on the information provided is that Shellcode scripts were executed in memory, not PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting.

Final Answer: B: No
