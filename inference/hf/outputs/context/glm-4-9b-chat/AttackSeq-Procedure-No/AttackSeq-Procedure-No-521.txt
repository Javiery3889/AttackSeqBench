Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Execution: The attack utilized a vulnerability exploit (CVE-2017-0199) rather than macros. The .hta file delivered by the embedded link in the Word document was executed by mshta.exe.
  2. Persistence: The Helminth Trojan agent achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI', which executes a VBS file every 3 minutes.
  3. Defense Evasion: The Helminth Trojan agent used various evasive mechanisms, including regeneration of its signatures and a sophisticated version of Mimikatz.
  4. Credential Access: The bat script used in the attack is a customized version of Mimikatz, designed to gather information.
  5. Command and Control: The DnE1.Ps1 file communicates with a C&C server using DNS exchange queries.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.
  2. Executing the embedded .hta file using mshta.exe.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the attack sequence began with the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, which led to the execution of the .hta file by mshta.exe. This was followed by the addition of a scheduled task for persistence.
- The question asks if the attack executed the .hta file using mshta.exe only after utilizing Microsoft Word documents for initial access. According to the outline, the Word document was used to deliver the .hta file, which was then executed by mshta.exe. This suggests that the initial access was achieved through the Word document, and the subsequent execution of the .hta file was part of the same attack sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack began with the exploitation of CVE-2017-0199 through a Word document, which delivered the .hta file.
- The .hta file was executed by mshta.exe, which is a part of the initial access phase.
- Persistence was achieved by adding a scheduled task after the initial access and execution.
- The sequence of events in the outline supports the idea that the .hta file was executed using mshta.exe after the initial access through the Word document.

Final Answer: A: Yes
