Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Discovery
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials
  2. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses Mimikatz to extract credentials, which is a method that does not involve dumping LSASS process memory. However, the outline does mention that they use ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials, which suggests that they may use both methods.
- The outline also states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the second part of the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that FIN13 will dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations. However, it does mention that they use both ProcDump and Mimikatz, which could imply that they may use a combination of methods to achieve their objectives.
- Given that the question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will perform these actions in the sequence mentioned, we can infer that they may use a multi-step approach to gather information and obtain credentials.
- Therefore, it is plausible that they could dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before moving on to reconnaissance activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
