1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Lateral Movement
     10. Collection
     11. Command and Control
     12. Exfiltration
     13. Impact

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. T1195 Supply Chain Compromise (initial access vector)
     2. Parking domains for future use (Resource Development)

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly state the order in which the attackers used T1195 Supply Chain Compromise and parked domains for future use. However, it does mention that the attackers had significant Resource Development capabilities and parked domains for future use (T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains).
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers parked domains for future use after using T1195 Supply Chain Compromise. The outline does not provide a clear sequence of events, but it does suggest that the attackers had a well-planned Resource Development phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the attackers had a sophisticated Resource Development phase, which included parking domains for future use.
   - Step 2: The outline does not specify the exact sequence of events, but it does not contradict the idea that the attackers could have used T1195 Supply Chain Compromise as an initial access vector before engaging in Resource Development.
   - Step 3: Given the lack of explicit sequence details in the outline, we must infer that the attackers' actions were part of a broader campaign that could have included both initial access and subsequent resource development activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
