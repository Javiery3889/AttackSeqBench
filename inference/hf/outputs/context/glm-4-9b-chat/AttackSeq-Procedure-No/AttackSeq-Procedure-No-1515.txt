Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents.
- Execution: Leveraging old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a backdoor.
- Persistence: Creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to maintain access.
- Defense Evasion: Anti-analysis, anti-debugging, anti-sandboxing techniques, and data encryption.
- Discovery: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
- Collection: Collecting a wide range of data from the victim's system.
- Command and Control: Communicating with a C&C server using encrypted communication.
- Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication after shutting down the victim's computer.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication. This is mentioned under the "Command and Control" and "Exfiltration" sections.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor is designed to communicate with a C&C server, and the communication is encrypted, which is a standard practice for exfiltrating data to avoid detection.
- The question specifies that the backdoor shuts down the victim's computer, but this action does not inherently prevent the backdoor from exfiltrating data before it does so.
- Given that the backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data and the communication is encrypted, it is likely that it will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
