1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     2. Execution: VBS macro executes, calling a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads, and leverages DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
     4. Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download payloads.
     5. Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are downloaded and executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Phishing emails with the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.
     2. Execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document.
     3. Gaining initial access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a phishing campaign where the initial access is gained through the execution of VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document. This aligns with the first two TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros before gaining initial access. The CTI outline supports this, as the VBS macro is part of the initial access phase of the attack.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline clearly states that the campaign involves phishing emails with embedded macros, which is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - Step 2: The execution of the VBS macro is described as the method by which the attack gains initial access, which is the second step in the attack sequence.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the VBS macro execution is a prerequisite for gaining initial access, and the CTI outline confirms this by describing the VBS macro as the means of initial access.
   - Final Answer: Based on the analysis, the sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
