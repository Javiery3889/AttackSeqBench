1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack using an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team data breach.
     - Execution: The Flash exploit (show.swf) executes shellcode for installing a payload.
     - The exploit contains ActionScript designed to create a use-after-free condition to exploit CVE-2015-5119.
     - The shellcode for CVE-2015-5119 is similar to that of CVE-2015-3113, indicating a potential for NTLM hash capture.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Spear-phishing attack leveraging a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
     - The Flash file 'show.swf' downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes.
     - The shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a spear-phishing attack that uses a Flash exploit to install a payload. It mentions that the Flash exploit contains ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload and that the shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 are similar, which could imply a potential for NTLM hash capture.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that NTLM downgrading occurs, but it does mention that the shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 are similar, and the latter was associated with NTLM hash capture.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is gained through a spear-phishing attack using a Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119).
   - Step 2: The Flash exploit (show.swf) is designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload.
   - Step 3: The shellcode for CVE-2015-5119 is similar to that of CVE-2015-3113, which was associated with NTLM hash capture.
   - Step 4: Given the similarity in shellcode, it is plausible that the same techniques used in CVE-2015-3113 could be employed in CVE-2015-5119, including NTLM downgrading.

Final Answer: A: Yes
