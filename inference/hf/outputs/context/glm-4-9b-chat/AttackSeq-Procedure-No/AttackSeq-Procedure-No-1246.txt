1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: SUNSPOT malware is used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds.
     2. Persistence: SUNSPOT maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.
     3. Privilege Escalation: SUNSPOT grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token.
     4. Defense Evasion: SUNSPOT employs several defense evasion techniques, including encryption and masquerading as a legitimate binary.
     5. Discovery: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect targeted Visual Studio solution build.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery: Monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.
     2. Impact: Engaging in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files then encrypting them.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention double-extortion ransomware as part of the attack sequence. The TTPs described are focused on the initial insertion of the SUNBURST backdoor, maintaining persistence, escalating privileges, evading defenses, and discovering targeted processes.
   - The question asks if it is likely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware after the Discovery tactic. The outline does not provide any information about the SUNSPOT malware's capability to perform ransomware activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not mention ransomware activities.
   - Step 2: The Discovery tactic is part of the attack sequence, but the subsequent Impact tactic is not described.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about ransomware activities, we cannot conclude that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware based on the given information.

Final Answer: B: No
