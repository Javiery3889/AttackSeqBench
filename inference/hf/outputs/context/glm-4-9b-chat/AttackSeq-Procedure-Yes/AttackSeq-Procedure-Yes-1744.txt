Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Reconnaissance: TG1021 used offensive security tools to perform reconnaissance.
- Initial Access: TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
- Execution: TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
- Persistence: TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework to maintain persistence, removing disk-resident tools after use.
- Privilege Escalation: TG1021 used PotatoEx.dll and dynamic DLL loading for privilege escalation.
- Credential Access: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
- Discovery: TG1021 used offensive security tools to scan and map targets.
- Lateral Movement: TG1021 accessed shared folders and used web shell loaders to move laterally.
- Command and Control: TG1021 established command and control using an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools after employing PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that TG1021 removed all disk-resident tools after using them, which suggests a deliberate effort to avoid detection.
- The use of PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation is a clear indication that TG1021 was attempting to gain higher-level access on the compromised system.
- The removal of disk-resident tools is a defense evasion strategy that is often used to reduce the likelihood of detection by security tools that scan for malicious files on disk.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- TG1021's use of PotatoEx.dll for privilege escalation is a targeted action to increase their control over the system, which is consistent with an attacker who is trying to avoid detection.
- The removal of disk-resident tools is a direct action taken to further reduce the likelihood of detection, as it limits the footprint left on the system.
- Given the outlined TTPs and the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that TG1021's actions were part of a defense evasion strategy.

Final Answer: A: Yes
