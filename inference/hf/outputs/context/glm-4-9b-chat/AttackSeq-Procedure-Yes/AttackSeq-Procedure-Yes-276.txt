Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file. The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
- Defense Evasion: The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time, and the malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components.
- Command and Control: The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process, which then contacts the C&C server.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Defense Evasion
3. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg' before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the sequence of events as follows:
  1. A malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered, containing encrypted script data and an external template.
  2. The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services and points to a document with malicious VBA macros.
  3. The VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.
  4. The malware payload is generated using image files and signed with a valid certificate.
  5. The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject the payload into an Internet Explorer process, and the payload contacts the C&C server.

Based on the outline, the sequence of TTPs is:
1. Delivery of malicious Microsoft Word document.
2. Download of external template via URL shortening service.
3. Decryption and dropping of 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' by the VBA code.
4. Generation of malware payload using image files.
5. Use of Process Hollowing by the Bandook loader.

The question asks if the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' before downloading the zip file containing the malware payload. The outline does not explicitly mention the download of a zip file containing components for the malware payload, but it does describe the generation of the malware payload using image files.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events in the outline suggests that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script and the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' are part of the initial payload deployment.
- The outline does not provide information about the order in which these scripts are executed relative to the download of the zip file containing the malware payload.
- However, since the 'fmx.ps1' script is mentioned before the generation of the malware payload using image files, it is plausible that the 'fmx.ps1' script would decode and execute the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' before any download of additional components.

Final Answer: A: Yes
