1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing campaigns to gain access using malicious URLs and exploit documents.
     2. Execution: Executing malware on victim systems through exploit documents.
     3. Defense Evasion: Evading defenses by using zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
     4. Credential Access: Harvesting credentials through spear-phishing and credential harvesters.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Spear-phishing campaigns to harvest credentials.
     2. Use of known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers.
     3. Moving deeper into victim networks in the Lateral Movement phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials and then executes malware on victim systems. It also mentions that APT28 has demonstrated the ability to evade defenses by leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities and using legitimate tools for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into victim networks in the Lateral Movement phase.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that APT28 uses known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers. However, it does mention that they have exploited vulnerabilities such as CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255 to install malware on victims. This suggests that APT28 is capable of using known vulnerabilities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: APT28 is known to use known vulnerabilities to deploy malware, as evidenced by the exploitation of CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255.
   - Step 2: The question asks if APT28 is likely to use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into the network.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that APT28 uses known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers specifically, but it does show their capability to exploit vulnerabilities.
   - Step 4: Given that APT28 has shown the ability to exploit vulnerabilities and considering the nature of their operations, it is plausible that they could use known vulnerabilities to exploit internet-facing servers before moving deeper into the network.

Final Answer: A: Yes
