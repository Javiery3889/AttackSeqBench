1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery
     2. Exploit remote services for lateral movement
     3. Install additional persistence points on new systems

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if, after the discovery phase, the attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.
   - According to the CTI outline, the discovery phase comes before the collection phase, which is followed by the command and control phase. The installation of persistence points is part of the persistence phase, which comes before the privilege escalation phase.
   - The question implies a sequence that goes from discovery to lateral movement to persistence. This sequence does not directly align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as lateral movement is typically part of the lateral movement phase, not immediately following discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The discovery phase is where attackers gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission.
   - Step 2: Lateral movement is a tactic that typically occurs after initial access and before persistence, as it involves moving within the network to other systems.
   - Step 3: Persistence points are installed to ensure ongoing access to the compromised network, which is a phase that comes after lateral movement.
   - Step 4: Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement is not immediately followed by persistence but rather comes before it.
   - Conclusion: The sequence of TTPs described in the question does not align with the typical sequence of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Final Answer: B: No
