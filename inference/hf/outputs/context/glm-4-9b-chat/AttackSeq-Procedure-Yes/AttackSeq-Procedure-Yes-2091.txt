Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Discovery
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon
  2. Collecting administrative-level credentials
  3. Moving laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations, and targeting internal hosts and servers

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that after collecting administrative-level credentials, the attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network. This is followed by the Collection phase, where the attackers collected potentially valuable documents for exfiltration.
- The outline also mentions that the attackers had the ability to download and execute new payloads, run shell commands to move laterally in the infrastructure, and delete files from the system to leave fewer forensic traces. This suggests that moving laterally across the infrastructure is a plausible step in the attack sequence.
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after discovering and mapping the network and collecting credentials. Given the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would attempt to move laterally to further their access and control over the network.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers have already compromised a Domain Administrator account, which gives them significant privileges. After mapping the network and collecting credentials, the logical next step would be to exploit these credentials to move laterally within the network.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the attackers will compromise numerous workstations, but it does mention that they had the ability to move laterally and delete files to avoid detection, which suggests they would continue to expand their presence within the network.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline and the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question, it is plausible that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
