1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Analysis of attackers' infrastructure, identification of IPs, and use of compromised websites.
     2. Initial Access: Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports, mimicry of popular software for malicious container images, and massive attacks on container platforms.
     3. Execution: Abuse of command and script interpreters, execution of malicious commands, scripts, or binaries, and scheduling local jobs.
     4. Persistence: Use of LD_PRELOAD, creation of new user accounts with RSA keys, and chroot for processes outside the container.
     5. Privilege Escalation: Use of hostPath mount and chroot.
     6. Defense Evasion: Removal of security software and obfuscation of malicious binaries.
     7. Credential Access: Use of open-source tools to collect credentials and creation of hidden users.
     8. Command and Control: Use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
     9. Exfiltration: Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials and use of worms.
     10. Impact: Cryptocurrency mining as the main objective with emerging objectives like backdoors and credential theft.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the detection of compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON for detection of compromised Docker APIs. However, it does mention the reconnaissance phase, which is part of the Resource Development tactic. During this phase, attackers would likely gather information about potential targets, including identifying misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using such tools before deploying malicious containers. Given that the attackers are using open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities and exploit them, it is plausible that they would use similar tools for reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that attackers are sophisticated and use a variety of tools and techniques.
   - Step 2: The reconnaissance phase is a critical step in the attack lifecycle, where attackers gather information about potential targets.
   - Step 3: Given the attackers' use of open-source and offensive security tools, it is reasonable to assume they would use similar tools for reconnaissance.
   - Step 4: The question specifically asks about the use of DOCKERGEDDON, which is a tool designed to detect misconfigured Docker APIs.

Final Answer: A: Yes
