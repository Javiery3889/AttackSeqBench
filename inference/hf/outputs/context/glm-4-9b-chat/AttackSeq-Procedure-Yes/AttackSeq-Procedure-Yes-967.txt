Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with the Naikon APT group using a weaponized RTF file to drop a loader, followed by the loader attempting to download and execute the next stage payload from a C&C server.
- Execution: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
- Persistence: Persistence is established through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, and some variants inject into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
- Defense Evasion: The group uses limited daily windows for C&C servers, fileless loading, and changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
- Collection: The Aria-body backdoor can create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
- Command and Control: The group uses HTTP and TCP for C&C communication, sending data to the C&C domain with an XORed password, and the backdoor listens for commands.
- Others: The group targets government entities in the Asia Pacific region, uses servers within infected entities as C&C servers, and has specific modules for data gathering and keylogging.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor will gather system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP during the Discovery phase before sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during Command and Control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the Aria-body backdoor has the capability to collect OS information, which includes host-name, computer-name, and public IP. This is part of the Collection phase.
- The question specifically mentions the Discovery phase, which is not explicitly detailed in the CTI outline. However, the Collection phase often involves gathering information about the system and environment, which could be considered part of the Discovery phase.
- The Command and Control phase involves sending collected data to the C&C domain, which is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Aria-body backdoor is capable of collecting system information, which is a typical activity during the Discovery phase.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the Discovery phase is when the system information is gathered, but given the capabilities of the backdoor, it is reasonable to infer that it would gather such information.
- The Command and Control phase involves sending the collected data to the C&C domain, which is consistent with the TTPs described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
