Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Attackers entice victims to download mobile applications loaded with spyware.
  2. Collection: The malware embedded in the mobile applications collects a wide range of data from the victims' devices.
  3. Command and Control: The stolen data is sent back to the attackers' command and control (C&C) servers using HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the Command and Control phase, specifically whether the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data over an application layer protocol.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that the stolen data is sent back to the attackers' C&C servers using HTTP POST requests. HTTP is an application layer protocol (as defined by the OSI model), which is used for transmitting data over the web.
- The question asks if the attackers' infrastructure will receive the stolen data over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase. Since HTTP is an application layer protocol and the outline specifies that the data is sent using HTTP POST requests, the answer aligns with the information provided.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline clearly indicates that the data is sent using HTTP POST requests, which is an application layer protocol.
- The question asks if the data is likely to be received over an application layer protocol during the Command and Control phase, and the answer is supported by the CTI outline.
- Final Answer: A: Yes
