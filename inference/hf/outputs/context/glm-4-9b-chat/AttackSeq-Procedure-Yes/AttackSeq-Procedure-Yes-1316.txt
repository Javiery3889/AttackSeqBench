Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Deceiving victims into opening a PDF file with an exploit or Windows executable.
- Execution: Using a loader from MiniDuke to execute the malware.
- Persistence: Creating a scheduled task and Windows service for long-term presence.
- Credential Access: Stealing credentials from various software and Windows.
- Discovery: Searching for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
- Collection: Using keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.
- Exfiltration: Automatically uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: keylogging, screenshotting, clipboard stealing, communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, which matches the first part of the question's sequence.
- The outline also mentions that the information collected by CosmicDuke is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP, which matches the last part of the question's sequence.
- However, the outline does not mention WebDav as a method of communication with remote servers. It only specifies FTP.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline includes the use of keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing as part of the Collection phase.
- The outline also indicates that the collected information is exfiltrated via FTP.
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav. While the outline confirms the use of FTP, it does not mention WebDav.
- Therefore, the sequence of TTPs in the question is partially aligned with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
