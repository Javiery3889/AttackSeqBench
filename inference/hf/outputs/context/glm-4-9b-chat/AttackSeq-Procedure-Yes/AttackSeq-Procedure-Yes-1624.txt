Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Scanning for new targets, particularly focusing on Ukraine and Spain.
  2. Initial Access: Employing spear phishing emails, phishing websites, and malicious iFrames.
  3. Execution: Dropping and executing a file to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
  4. Persistence: Changing file timestamps to hide files from victims.
  5. Privilege Escalation: Using a tool to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability.
  6. Defense Evasion: Changing file timestamps and using a proxy tool.
  7. Credential Access: Deploying a password dumping tool.
  8. Discovery: Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
  9. Command and Control: C&C communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption if necessary.
  10. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data such as emails and files to the central server.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Discovery: Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
  2. Exfiltration: Deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that APT28 performs discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. The outline also mentions that APT28 exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.
- The question asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server as part of data collection efforts. This aligns with the Exfiltration phase of the attack, which is the final phase before the attack is complete.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that APT28 is actively engaged in exfiltrating data, which is a critical part of their attack strategy.
- The question specifically asks about the deployment of additional modules like pr.dll, which is a part of the exfiltration process.
- Given that the outline mentions the exfiltration of data and does not contradict the idea of deploying additional modules for this purpose, it is reasonable to infer that APT28 would deploy such modules as part of their data collection efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
