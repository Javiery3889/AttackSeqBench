Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Gathering intelligence and reconnaissance on potential targets.
  2. Initial Access: Delivery of the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) through a phishing campaign.
  3. Credential Access: Harvesting credentials and expanding access across the network.
  4. Discovery: Lateral movement and target identification on the corporate and ICS networks.
  5. Command and Control: Establishing a connection to an attacker-controlled Command and Control (C2) server.
  6. Impact: Developing malicious computer code and delivering it to the target systems.
  7. Delivery of Data Destruction Malware: Placing KillDisk malware on a network share and setting a policy on the domain controller.
  8. Schedule Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Disruption: Scheduling unauthorized outages of UPS for critical systems.
  9. Trip Breakers: Disrupting power distribution to customers.
  10. Sever Connection to Field Devices: Delivering malicious updates to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices.
  11. Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack: Initiating a DoS attack on a telephone call center.
  12. Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage: Cutting power to critical systems.
  13. Destroy Critical System Data: Erasing master boot records and deleting system log data.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the establishment of a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution after delivering the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that the BlackEnergy 3 RAT is installed after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. This is part of the Initial Access phase.
- In the Command and Control phase (Step 5), it is mentioned that the malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server. This connection is established as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline clearly shows that after the delivery of the BlackEnergy 3 RAT, the malware establishes a C2 connection.
- The malicious VBA script execution is part of the Initial Access phase, but the establishment of the C2 connection is part of the Command and Control phase.
- Therefore, it is plausible that after the adversaries deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT through a phishing campaign, they will establish a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution to enable further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
