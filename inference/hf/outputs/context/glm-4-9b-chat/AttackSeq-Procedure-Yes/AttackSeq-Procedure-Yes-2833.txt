Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Execution: The exploit leverages a previously unknown use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
  2. Preparation: The exploit involves preparing the heap with a Flash SWF file.
  3. Triggering: The IE bug is triggered via Javascript.
  4. Memory Access: Corrupted Flash vector objects are used for memory access.
  5. Runtime ROP Generation: Runtime ROP generation is used to search for specific APIs and construct a ROP chain.
  6. Execution: The ROP chain is used to execute shellcode.
  7. Defense Evasion: The shellcode makes memory executable and clears debug registers, possibly to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation.
  8. Payload Delivery: The shellcode also downloads the next stage of the payload.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
  2. Executing shellcode to make memory executable.
  3. Bypassing ASLR and DEP protections.
  4. Bypassing EAF mitigation.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the exploit uses a well-known Flash exploitation technique to achieve arbitrary memory access and bypass Windows' ASLR and DEP protections. This aligns with the third TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline also states that the shellcode makes memory executable and clears debug registers, which could be part of the process to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation. This aligns with the fourth TTP mentioned in the question.
- The sequence of bypassing ASLR and DEP protections is not explicitly mentioned to occur before bypassing EAF mitigation, but it is logical to assume that the exploit would need to bypass these protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation, as they are all part of the defense evasion phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline suggests that the exploit bypasses ASLR and DEP protections before executing the shellcode, which is part of the defense evasion phase.
- The question asks if it is likely that the exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation.
- Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is plausible that the exploit would bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation, as these are all part of the defense evasion process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
