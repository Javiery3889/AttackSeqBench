1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information through malicious documents.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
     4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence on the system.
     5. Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance.
     6. Command and Control: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
     2. The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline states that the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, sending data encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding. This indicates that the implant is already using these methods for communication.
   - The question asks if the implant would use these same methods (RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding) to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server. Since the implant is already using these methods for communication, it is reasonable to assume that it would use them for data exfiltration as well, given that the same encryption and obfuscation techniques are being used for the same purpose.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that the Rising Sun implant uses RC4 and Base64 for communication with control servers.
   - Step 2: The question asks about the likelihood of the implant using the same methods for data exfiltration.
   - Step 3: Since the implant is already using RC4 and Base64 for communication, it is plausible that it would use the same methods for exfiltration.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
