Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: ChromeLoader spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension capable of stealing information and serving adware.
- Defense Evasion: ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if ChromeLoader is likely to install a persistent Chrome browser extension before attempting to evade macOS security technology with an animated image.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence from the CTI outline shows that ChromeLoader first spreads through malverts and malspam, using a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension. This is the Initial Access phase.
- The Defense Evasion phase follows, where ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.

Based on the sequence of events described in the CTI outline, ChromeLoader is likely to install the persistent Chrome browser extension as part of the Initial Access phase before moving on to Defense Evasion tactics.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Initial Access phase is where ChromeLoader uses a DMG containing a shell script to install the Chrome browser extension.
- The Defense Evasion phase is where ChromeLoader attempts to evade macOS security technology.
- The sequence of events in the CTI outline suggests that the installation of the Chrome browser extension is part of the Initial Access phase, and the evasion tactics are part of the Defense Evasion phase.
- Therefore, it is plausible that ChromeLoader would install the persistent Chrome browser extension before attempting to evade macOS security technology.

Final Answer: A: Yes
