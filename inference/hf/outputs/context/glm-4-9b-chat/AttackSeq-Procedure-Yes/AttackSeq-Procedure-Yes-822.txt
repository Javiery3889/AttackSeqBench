Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: FIN4 targets individuals with access to confidential information about M&A deals and major market-moving announcements.
  2. Resource Development: FIN4 organizes their targets using 'campaign codes' and transmits these codes along with stolen credentials to their C2 servers.
  3. Initial Access: FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to capture Outlook credentials.
  4. Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Outlook accounts to delete emails with certain keywords.
  5. Command and Control: FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials and relies on Tor for anonymous communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Labeling the origin of stolen credentials using 'campaign codes'.
  2. Using spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials.
  3. Transmitting those credentials to their C2 servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access to their targets' information (Initial Access). This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline also indicates that stolen credentials are transmitted to FIN4's C2 servers (Command and Control), which aligns with the third TTP in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides a clear sequence of events where FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to capture credentials, which are then transmitted to their C2 servers.
- The question asks if it is likely that FIN4 will use these methods after labeling the origin of stolen credentials using 'campaign codes'.
- Given that the CTI outline shows that these methods are part of the attack sequence, it is reasonable to conclude that they are used in the order described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
