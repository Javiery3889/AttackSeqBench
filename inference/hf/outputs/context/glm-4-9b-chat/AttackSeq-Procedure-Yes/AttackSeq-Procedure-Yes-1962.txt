1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: The StellarParticle campaign gained access via SSH and RDP, used VPNs, and exported Chrome browser passwords.
   - Persistence: They used credential hopping, Delegated Administrator rights, and malware for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: They stole browser cookies and renamed utilities.
   - Discovery: They used AdFind, PowerShell, and custom tooling for information gathering.
   - Lateral Movement: They used RDP with both privileged and non-privileged accounts.
   - Collection: They accessed data from Information Repositories.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations before using them in credential access techniques to access cloud resources.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline mentions that the campaign stole browser cookies, which is a form of credential theft. This is a common technique to bypass MFA and gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - The outline also states that the campaign used credential hopping, which implies that they are actively using stolen credentials to move laterally within the network.
   - The question specifically asks about the likelihood of the campaign stealing web session cookies from end-user workstations and using them to access cloud resources. The outline does not explicitly mention cloud resources, but it does mention that they added credentials to O365 Service Principals, which suggests they have an interest in accessing cloud-based services.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The StellarParticle campaign has demonstrated a pattern of credential theft and lateral movement within the network.
   - Step 2: The campaign has shown the capability to bypass MFA by stealing browser cookies.
   - Step 3: The campaign has shown an interest in accessing cloud resources by adding credentials to O365 Service Principals.
   - Step 4: Given the campaign's tactics, it is plausible that they would attempt to steal web session cookies from end-user workstations to use in credential access techniques, including accessing cloud resources.

Final Answer: A: Yes
