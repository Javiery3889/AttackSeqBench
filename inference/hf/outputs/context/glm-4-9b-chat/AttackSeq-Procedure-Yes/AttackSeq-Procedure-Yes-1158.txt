Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.
- Execution: The malware is executed using trojanized installers, which deploy the malware and legitimate applications.
- Persistence: Persistence is achieved by creating a service that launches the C2 contact module upon service startup.
- Defense Evasion: The malware checks for specific antiviruses and adds its directories to Windows Defender exclusions.
- Command and Control: The C2 infrastructure uses around 30 new C2 domains with hardcoded domains and communicates over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.
- Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates encoded archives containing documents to the C2 server.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the PROMETHIUM malware, after exfiltrating files, is likely to send the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS with hardened infrastructure supported by self-signed certificates.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware exfiltrates encoded archives containing documents to the C2 server.
- The C2 infrastructure is mentioned to communicate over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that the malware exfiltrates data to the C2 server.
- The C2 infrastructure's use of HTTPS and self-signed certificates is also mentioned.
- Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware would send the encoded archive to the C2 server over HTTPS with the described infrastructure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
