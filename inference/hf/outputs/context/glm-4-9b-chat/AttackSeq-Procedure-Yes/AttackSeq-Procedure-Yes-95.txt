1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
     2. Execution: The HTA file executed a script that checked for installed antivirus software using WMI and communicated with the C2 server.
     3. Persistence: The backdoor named FinalBot.exe was executed, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.
     4. Defense Evasion: The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and used VBS, and the backdoor employed DLL sideloading.
     5. Discovery: The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 via an RTF document to drop an HTA file.
     2. Using WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
     3. Executing the FinalBot backdoor with DLL sideloading for defense evasion.
     4. The HTA file communicating with the C2 server.
     5. Leveraging webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the HTA file, after executing the script that checks for antivirus software, communicates with the C2 server. This aligns with the fourth TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The domain webserv-redir.net is mentioned as the source from which the HTA file was downloaded, which suggests that it is likely to be used for Command and Control (C2) activities.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that the HTA file communicates with the C2 server.
   - Step 2: The domain webserv-redir.net is associated with the initial download of the HTA file, indicating its potential use for C2 activities.
   - Step 3: The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.
   - Step 4: Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and use webserv-redir.net for C2.

Final Answer: A: Yes
