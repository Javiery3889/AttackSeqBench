Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
  2. Execution: Custom loader executes the Korplug variant.
  3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence on the system.
  4. Defense Evasion: Use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
  5. Discovery: Collection of system information.
  6. Command and Control: Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
  7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
  2. Data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control and data exfiltration. This suggests that after gathering data from network shared drives, Korplug would likely proceed with data exfiltration using the same protocol.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The CTI outline describes the use of a custom TCP-based protocol for both command and control and data exfiltration.
- Step 2: The question asks if Korplug is likely to proceed with data exfiltration after gathering data from network shared drives.
- Step 3: Since the same protocol is used for both command and control and data exfiltration, it is reasonable to assume that the protocol used for data exfiltration is consistent with the protocol used for command and control.
- Step 4: The CTI outline does not mention any exceptions or changes in protocol after data collection from network shared drives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
