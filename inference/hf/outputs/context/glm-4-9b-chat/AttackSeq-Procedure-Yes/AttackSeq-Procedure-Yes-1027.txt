Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
- Execution: Scripting (Batch, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments.
- Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros in documents.
- Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modifying registry keys, code signing, deobfuscation, remote templates, C# compiler module.
- Discovery: Backdoors list interesting files for exfiltration.
- Lateral Movement: Malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for sending emails.
- Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
- Exfiltration: Modules upload harvested documents to C&C server.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: taking screenshots every minute, and then employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of malware to take screenshots every minute. However, it does describe the use of backdoors that automatically list interesting files for exfiltration, which suggests a focus on data collection and exfiltration.
- The outline also mentions the use of HTTP and HTTPS for command and control, which is consistent with the second part of the question.

Given the information provided in the CTI outline, there is no direct evidence that Gamaredon uses malware to take screenshots every minute. The focus of the Gamaredon group, as described, is on data exfiltration and persistence rather than on continuous surveillance or data collection activities such as taking screenshots every minute.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of screenshot-taking malware by Gamaredon.
- The group's tactics are centered around data exfiltration and persistence, not continuous surveillance.
- There is no indication that taking screenshots is a part of their standard operation or a known TTP.

Final Answer: B: No
