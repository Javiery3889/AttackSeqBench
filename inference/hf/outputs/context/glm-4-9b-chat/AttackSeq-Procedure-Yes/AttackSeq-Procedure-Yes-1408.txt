1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Cybercriminals targeted Instagram users, particularly influencers, using phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages containing generic greetings and false claims of copyright violations or verified badges.
     2. Credential Access: The attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials. They changed the account passwords and downloaded all images and messages from the accounts.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials.
     2. Locking out original account owners.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a typical phishing attack where the attackers gain initial access to the victims' accounts and then proceed to access their credentials. After obtaining the credentials, they lock out the original owners and download the account data.
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the cybercriminals will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate further scams.
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention ransom demands. However, it does describe a scenario where the attackers have complete control over the compromised accounts and have access to sensitive data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the attackers have successfully compromised the accounts and have access to the victims' credentials and data.
   - Step 2: The attackers have already demonstrated a pattern of behavior that includes using the compromised accounts for their own gain (by changing passwords and downloading data).
   - Step 3: Given the typical behavior of cybercriminals in similar situations, it is common for them to demand ransom payments to regain access to their data or to prevent further misuse of their accounts.
   - Step 4: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will demand ransom payments before using the stolen accounts. Since the attackers have already shown intent to misuse the accounts, it is plausible that they would demand ransom payments to maintain control over the accounts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
