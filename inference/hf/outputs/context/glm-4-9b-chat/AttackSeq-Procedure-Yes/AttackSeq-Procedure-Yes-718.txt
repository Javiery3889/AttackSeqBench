1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information through malicious documents.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, and the Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
     3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
     4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence on the system.
     5. Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information.
     6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial reconnaissance by the Rising Sun implant.
     2. Communication with control servers for command and control purposes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data to the control server via HTTP POST requests. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
   - Answer choice A: Yes, suggests that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.
   - Answer choice B: No, suggests that the Rising Sun implant did not communicate with control servers via HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant is responsible for exfiltration.
   - Step 2: The exfiltration method mentioned is via HTTP POST requests.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the implant communicated with control servers for command and control purposes after initial reconnaissance.
   - Step 4: The CTI outline states that the implant exfiltrates data to the control server, which is a form of communication for command and control.
   - Step 5: Therefore, the answer to the question is aligned with the TTPs described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
