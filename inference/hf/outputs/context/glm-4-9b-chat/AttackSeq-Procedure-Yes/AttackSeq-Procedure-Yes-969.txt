Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a weaponized RTF file that drops a loader, followed by downloading and executing the next stage payload from a C&C server.
- Execution: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
- Persistence: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key and injects itself into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
- Defense Evasion: The group uses limited daily windows for C&C servers, fileless loading, and changes in server infrastructure.
- Collection: The Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location.
- Command and Control: The group uses HTTP and TCP for C&C communication, sending data to the C&C domain with an XORed password.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor, after achieving persistence and injecting into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe', is likely to gather information about the victim's machine, including details of the installed software and Windows version for discovery purposes.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Aria-body backdoor has the capability to gather file metadata, which includes details of the installed software, and collect OS information, which would include the Windows version.
- The question's scenario is directly related to the Collection phase of the attack, where the Aria-body backdoor is known to perform such actions.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Aria-body backdoor is designed to collect information about the victim's machine, which includes details of the installed software and the Windows version.
- The question's scenario is consistent with the capabilities of the Aria-body backdoor as described in the CTI outline.
- Therefore, it is likely that the Aria-body backdoor would gather this information after achieving persistence and injecting into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe'.

Final Answer: A: Yes
