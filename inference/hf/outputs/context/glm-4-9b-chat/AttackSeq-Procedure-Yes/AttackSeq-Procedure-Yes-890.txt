1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing campaigns using malicious URLs to harvest credentials or deliver exploit documents.
     2. Execution: Executing malware (like GAMEFISH) on victim systems through exploit documents.
     3. Credential Access: Harvesting credentials using spear-phishing and credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.
     4. Lateral Movement: Using strategic web compromises (SWC) and exploiting known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers to move deeper into victim networks.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Executing malware (GAMEFISH) through spear-phishing exploit documents.
     2. Leveraging legitimate tools within victims' systems for lateral movement.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of legitimate tools within victims' systems for lateral movement. However, it does describe APT28's use of strategic web compromises (SWC) and exploitation of known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers, which are methods that could be considered as leveraging existing infrastructure for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if APT28 will leverage legitimate tools already present within victims' systems for lateral movement, bypassing their traditional toolset for evading defenses. The outline does not provide information on whether APT28 uses legitimate tools for this purpose.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that APT28 uses a variety of tools and methods for lateral movement, including strategic web compromises and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - Step 2: The outline does not mention the use of legitimate tools within victims' systems for lateral movement.
   - Step 3: The question asks about the likelihood of APT28 using legitimate tools for lateral movement, which is not addressed in the outline.
   - Step 4: Given the lack of information in the outline about the use of legitimate tools for lateral movement, we cannot definitively conclude that APT28 would do so.

Final Answer: B: No
