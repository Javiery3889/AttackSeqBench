Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Phishing email with PowerPoint add-in document (.ppa) containing a VBA macro.
- Execution: VBA macro uses 'mshta.exe' to download and execute a dropper from a Blogspot URL, which contains VBScript code.
- Persistence: Malware creates a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours.
- Others: 'Document.exe' file is downloaded and used to deploy 'Outlook.exe' payload, which opens a listening TCP socket on localhost.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that RevengeRAT will establish communication with its command and control (C2) servers and send victim machine information to domains such as 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net' while the attacker's infrastructure is identified to be located in Canada and Brazil.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the specific domains 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net' as C2 servers for RevengeRAT. However, it does mention that the malware creates a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a malicious URL every two hours, which suggests that the malware is designed to establish persistent communication with a C2 server.
- The outline also states that the attack could not be attributed to a specific threat actor but had common TTPs with previous reports, including the use of shared infrastructure as a drop-server and the use of popular RATs as backdoors. This implies that the behavior of the malware aligns with typical RAT operations, which often include sending information back to the attacker's C2 servers.
- The attacker's infrastructure being located in Canada and Brazil does not inherently prevent the malware from communicating with C2 servers in other countries, as C2 communication is not geographically bound to the attacker's location.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the malware is designed to establish persistent communication, which is a characteristic of RATs.
- The lack of specific mention of the C2 domains in the outline does not negate the possibility that the malware could be communicating with such servers.
- Given the typical behavior of RATs and the absence of any information suggesting that the malware would not communicate with C2 servers, it is reasonable to assume that it could be sending information to the mentioned domains.

Final Answer: A: Yes
