Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents leading to the installation of a backdoor.
- Execution: Leveraging old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install the backdoor.
- Persistence: Creating a scheduled task to maintain the foothold on the system.
- Defense Evasion: Employing anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques.
- Discovery: Gathering detailed information about the victim's computer.
- Collection: Collecting a wide range of data from the victim's system.
- Command and Control: Communicating with a C&C server using an encrypted protocol.
- Impact: Capability to shut down the victim's computer.
- Others: The operation was attributed to a Chinese APT group.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  - Backdoor communicates with C&C server using an encrypted protocol.
  - Collects detailed system information.
  - Exfiltrates collected data over the established C&C channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the backdoor installed by the attackers has the capability to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, which includes file manipulation, screenshots, and network details.
- The backdoor communicates with a C&C server using an encrypted protocol, which is consistent with the question's description of the communication method.
- The outline does not explicitly state that the attackers exfiltrated the collected data over the C&C channel immediately after collecting it. However, it does state that the backdoor communicates with the C&C server, which implies that data collection and exfiltration are part of the backdoor's functionality.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor's capabilities to collect detailed system information are clearly outlined in the CTI report.
- The communication with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol is also described, which is consistent with the question's scenario.
- While the CTI report does not explicitly mention the timing of exfiltration, the fact that the backdoor is designed to communicate with a C&C server suggests that exfiltration is part of its intended use.
- Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers would leverage the backdoor's capabilities to collect detailed system information before exfiltrating the data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
