Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear phishing email delivering a CAB archive named 1-10-20-hb44_final impersonating a document from NIST.
- Execution: Malicious loader 1-10-20-hb44_final.exe uses obfuscation techniques, retrieves files from C2, and opens a decoy document.
- Defense Evasion: BlackSoul uses various obfuscation techniques, excluding strings of third-party compiled-in libraries.
- Credential Access: blacksoulLib searches for browser data, decodes C2 URL, generates login info, and returns data to BlackSoul in JSON format.
- Collection: BlackSoul capable of file transfers, running commands, executing commands from C2, downloading/uploading files, and updating configuration file.
- Command and Control: BlackSoul communicates with C2 server over RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based data encoding, using Cloudflare Workers Service and DNS-over-HTTPS.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if BlackSoul will likely exfiltrate data over the C2 channel through automated exfiltration after using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding for Command and Control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that BlackSoul is capable of file transfers and running arbitrary commands, which implies it can perform actions such as exfiltration.
- The outline also states that BlackSoul supports handling commands from its C2 server for executing commands and returning results, which suggests that exfiltration could be one of the commands sent to the C2 server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that BlackSoul has the capability to perform file transfers and execute commands, which includes the potential for exfiltration.
- Since BlackSoul communicates with the C2 server using the RESTful Strapi protocol and JSON-based encoding, it is plausible that it could exfiltrate data over this channel as part of its automated exfiltration process.
- Therefore, the answer that aligns with the attack sequence and capabilities of BlackSoul is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
