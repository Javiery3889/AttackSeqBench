1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The attack begins with the delivery of spearphishing emails containing spyware disguised as a PDF document targeting diplomats.
     2. Command and Control: The spyware establishes communication with several Command and Control (C&C) servers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Delivering spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF file to gain initial access.
     2. Using VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide information about the use of VMProtect for obfuscation. It only describes the initial access vector (spearphishing emails with spyware disguised as a PDF) and the identification of C&C servers.
   - The question asks whether the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used VMProtect for obfuscation. Since the CTI outline does not mention VMProtect or any form of obfuscation, we cannot confirm or deny the use of VMProtect based on the provided information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Identify the sequence of TTPs in the question.
   - Step 3: Compare the TTPs in the question with the details in the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the comparison.

Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of VMProtect for obfuscation, we cannot determine whether the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used it. Therefore, we cannot confidently select either "Yes" or "No" as the correct answer.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided information.
