Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links
- Execution: Deployment of malware (PlugX, RedLeaves, Quasar RAT) for long-term remote access
- Persistence: Use of scheduled tasks or Windows services for malware persistence
- Privilege Escalation: Use of credential theft tools (mimikatz, PwDump) to gain higher-level permissions
- Defense Evasion: Development of bespoke malware and use of open-source tools
- Discovery: Internal reconnaissance using Windows and open-source pentesting tools
- Lateral Movement: Leveraging shared MSP infrastructure
- Collection: Staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives
- Command and Control: Use of dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools for data transfer
- Exfiltration: Pushing and pulling data from victim networks to other networks

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will deploy tools such as mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping by using DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller after gaining higher-level permissions.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that APT10 uses credential theft tools like mimikatz or PwDump to gain higher-level permissions on compromised systems, which aligns with the question's scenario.
- The outline also mentions that APT10 uses DLL search order hijacking and sideloading to execute modified versions of open-source tools, which could be used in conjunction with credential theft tools for OS credential dumping.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: APT10 gains higher-level permissions using compromised MSP credentials.
- Step 2: APT10 uses credential theft tools like mimikatz or PwDump to further escalate privileges.
- Step 3: APT10 has been observed using DLL search order hijacking, which could be used to execute modified versions of tools for OS credential dumping.
- Step 4: The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will use DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller for OS credential dumping after gaining higher-level permissions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
