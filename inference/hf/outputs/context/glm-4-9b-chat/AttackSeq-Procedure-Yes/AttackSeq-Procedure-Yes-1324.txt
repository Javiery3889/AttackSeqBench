Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The CosmicDuke samples use a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, which was updated and used by CosmicDuke in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Discovery: CosmicDuke searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames with certain keywords.
- Command and Control: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: The collected information is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer before exfiltrating data via FTP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer. However, it does describe the following TTPs:
  - Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials, which could imply the use of a keylogger to capture login information.
  - Exfiltration: The information collected is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

The question asks about the use of additional tools like a keylogger and screenshotter, which are not directly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, given that CosmicDuke is designed to steal credentials, it is plausible that it uses a keylogger to capture such information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke is designed to steal credentials, which suggests the use of a keylogger.
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use additional tools like a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer before exfiltration.
- While the outline does not explicitly mention these tools, the nature of the attack suggests that they could be used to enhance the data collection process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
