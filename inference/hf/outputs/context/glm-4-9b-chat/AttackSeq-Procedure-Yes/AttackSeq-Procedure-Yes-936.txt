Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with phishing documents designed for Arabic speakers containing malicious macros that lead to a backdoor program.
- Execution: The backdoor program is executed, and it uses DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with a C2 server.
- Persistence: The backdoor checks for certain parameters and conditions to establish persistence on the system.
- Defense Evasion: The backdoor program evades detection by checking for virtual machines, sandboxes, and debugging environments.
- Discovery: The backdoor gathers host information after executing evasion techniques.
- Others: The attack is associated with the DarkHydrus APT organization, and the backdoor uses DNS tunneling for communication.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Discovery

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the backdoor program will establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling after gathering host information following successful evasion techniques.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor program uses DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server. This is mentioned under the Execution section of the outline.
- The question specifically asks about the communication method after gathering host information, which is part of the Discovery phase. However, the outline does not specify any change in communication method after the Discovery phase. It only mentions that the backdoor gathers host information after evasion techniques.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The backdoor program is known to use DNS tunneling for communication, as stated in the CTI outline.
- The question asks about the communication method after gathering host information, which is part of the Discovery phase.
- Since the outline does not indicate a change in communication method after the Discovery phase, it is reasonable to assume that the backdoor would continue to use DNS tunneling for communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
