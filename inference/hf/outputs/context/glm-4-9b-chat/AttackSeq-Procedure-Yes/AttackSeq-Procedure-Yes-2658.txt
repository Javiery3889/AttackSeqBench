Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
  2. Execution: Custom loader executes the Korplug variant.
  3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence on the system.
  4. Defense Evasion: Use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
  5. Discovery: Collection of system information.
  6. Collection: Collection of metadata and content from local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
  7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration via a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports with compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
  2. Communicating with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports.
  3. Performing data exfiltration via compressed and encrypted TCP messages.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that after collecting data, Korplug performs data exfiltration via a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports with compressed and encrypted TCP messages. This matches the second and third TTPs mentioned in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that Korplug is designed to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports for data exfiltration.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.
- Therefore, the answer to whether Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports before performing data exfiltration is supported by the information provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
