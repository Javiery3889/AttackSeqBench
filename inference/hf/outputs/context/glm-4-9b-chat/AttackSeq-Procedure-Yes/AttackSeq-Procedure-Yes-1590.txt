Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The T9000 malware is delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
- Execution: The malware uses a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL and performs security product checks.
- Persistence: T9000 modifies registry keys and injects a DLL into explorer.exe for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: The malware customizes its installation to avoid detection and uses mutexes and named events.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol.
- Exfiltration: T9000 exfiltrates data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives, compresses and encrypts it, and sends it to the C2 server.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if T9000 is likely to target Skype users and automatically capture data, such as files from removable media, and steal sensitive files before exfiltrating this data to the C2 server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question mentions the TTPs of targeting Skype users, capturing data from removable media, and exfiltrating sensitive files to the C2 server.
- From the CTI outline, we can see that T9000 does exfiltrate various types of data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives (Exfiltration TTP).
- The outline also states that the malware was observed in targeted attacks against organizations in the United States, indicating a broad user targeting (Others TTP).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTPs described in the question are consistent with the TTPs listed in the CTI outline.
- The malware's behavior of exfiltrating data, including Skype communications and files from removable media, is explicitly mentioned in the outline.
- The "Others" section of the outline suggests that T9000 is designed for targeted attacks, which could include targeting Skype users.

Final Answer: A: Yes
