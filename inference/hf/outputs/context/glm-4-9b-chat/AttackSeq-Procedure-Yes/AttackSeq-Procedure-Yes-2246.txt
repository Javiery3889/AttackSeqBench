Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Reconnaissance: SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India, focusing on Kavach, an MFA app.
- Resource Development: SideCopy uses a variety of post-infection plugins for espionage, including those for credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
- Initial Access: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to deliver payloads.
- Execution: SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
- Persistence: SideCopy uses LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: SideCopy uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and evades detection by targeting Kavach.
- Discovery: SideCopy uses themes to target military personnel, LNK files, and decoy documents.
- Collection: SideCopy uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
- Command and Control: SideCopy uses fake and compromised websites for delivery and logs requests.
- Exfiltration: SideCopy targets Kavach and uses njRAT malware with special victim IDs and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that SideCopy targets Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India, and uses njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. This is part of the Exfiltration phase.
- The question is specifically asking about the credential access tactic, which is not explicitly mentioned in the outline. However, since the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases is a direct result of credential harvesting, it is reasonable to infer that this is part of the credential access tactic.
- The answer choices provided are "Yes" and "No."

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that SideCopy is indeed targeting Kavach and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
- The exfiltration of these credentials is a direct result of credential harvesting, which is a part of the credential access tactic.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is that SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
