1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploited CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps on Google Play.
     2. Execution: callCam app installed and executed in the background.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Used device rooting and accessibility permissions for payload installation.
     4. Defense Evasion: Employed obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
     5. Collection: callCam app collected sensitive information from the device.
     6. Command and Control: Used a C&C server for communication and payload downloads.
     7. Exfiltration: Collected data encrypted and exfiltrated to the C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Evading detection through overlay screens during the installation of the payload app.
     2. Collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.
     3. Encrypting the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms.
     4. Exfiltrating the encrypted data to the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, and the question asks about the likelihood of certain TTPs occurring after evading detection.
   - The outline states that the callCam app collects various types of data from the compromised devices and then encrypts it using RSA and AES encryption algorithms before sending it to the C&C server. This matches the third and fourth TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The use of overlay screens to evade detection is mentioned in the Defense Evasion section, which aligns with the first TTP in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attack sequence in the CTI outline includes the use of overlay screens to evade detection during the installation of the payload app, which matches the first TTP in the question.
   - Step 2: The callCam app is designed to collect data from the compromised devices, which matches the second TTP in the question.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline specifies that the collected data is encrypted using RSA and AES algorithms before exfiltration, which matches the third and fourth TTPs in the question.
   - Step 4: Since all the TTPs mentioned in the question are consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, it is plausible that the callCam app will perform these actions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
