Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware.
  2. Initial Access: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
  3. Execution: FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution and uses passive backdoors.
  4. Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries.
  5. Privilege Escalation: FIN13 utilizes common privilege escalation techniques, including using utilities like ProcDump and Mimikatz.
  6. Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors and custom droppers.
  7. Discovery: FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
  8. Lateral Movement: The group uses WMI and other utilities for lateral movement.
  9. Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
  10. Command and Control: FIN13 uses various protocols for command and control.
  11. Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.
  2. Dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials for their operations.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses native OS binaries for reconnaissance (Discovery phase). It also mentions that they use utilities like ProcDump and Mimikatz for privilege escalation, which includes credential harvesting (Privilege Escalation phase).
- The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before dumping LSASS process memory. According to the outline, these two actions are part of separate phases of the attack: reconnaissance and privilege escalation. However, the outline does not specify the exact sequence of these actions within those phases.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations during the Discovery phase.
- Step 2: FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz for credential harvesting during the Privilege Escalation phase.
- Step 3: The outline does not provide a specific sequence for these two actions within their respective phases.
- Step 4: Since the outline does not specify the order of these actions, we cannot definitively conclude that one must occur before the other.

Final Answer: B: No
