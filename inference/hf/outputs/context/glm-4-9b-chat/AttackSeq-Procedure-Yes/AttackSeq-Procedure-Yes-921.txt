1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server.
     2. Execution: Injection of web shell code into the server.
     3. Persistence: Installation of Explosive with various service names and paths.
     4. Defense Evasion: Hiding from detection tools and merging into surroundings.
     5. Credential Access: Leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain access to passwords.
     6. Lateral Movement: Using initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network.
     7. Command and Control: Multi-tiered server backend framework for control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers.
     2. Using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
     3. Employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network (Lateral Movement). It also mentions that more recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection (Lateral Movement).
   - The question asks if the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot before employing the Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the attackers will use the pivot before infecting USB devices, but it does show that both pivot and USB infection are part of the lateral movement phase of the attack.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is gained by scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline indicates that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network.
   - Step 3: The Explosive Trojan is used for lateral movement, which includes infecting USB devices.
   - Step 4: While the CTI outline does not explicitly state the order of pivot and USB infection, it does show that both are part of the lateral movement phase.
   - Step 5: Given that the lateral movement phase includes both pivot and USB infection, it is plausible that the attackers would use the infected servers as a pivot before employing the Explosive Trojan to infect USB devices.

Final Answer: A: Yes
