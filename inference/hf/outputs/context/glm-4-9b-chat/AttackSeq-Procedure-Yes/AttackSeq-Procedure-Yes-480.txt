1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spam emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     2. Execution: The document drops a JS file that executes in the background.
     3. Persistence: The JS file creates a copy in the Startup folder for persistence.
     4. Defense Evasion: Trickbot checks for running processes and analysis-related processes to evade detection.
     5. Credential Access: Trickbot steals credentials from various applications.
     6. Collection: Trickbot uses a PoS module and a proxy module to intercept and modify web traffic.
     7. Command and Control: Trickbot connects to a C2 server to download its payload.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Command and Control: Trickbot connects to its C2 server.
     2. Impact Tactics: Deleting files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not mention any TTPs related to deleting files with specific extensions located in removable and network drives. The closest TTPs are the Defense Evasion and Credential Access stages, which are not directly related to file deletion.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide any information about file deletion as part of the attack sequence.
   - Step 2: The question asks if it is likely that Trickbot will proceed to delete files with specific extensions after connecting to its C2 server.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not mention file deletion, we cannot confirm that this is part of the attack sequence.
   - Step 4: Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that Trickbot will delete files as part of its impact tactics.

Final Answer: B: No
