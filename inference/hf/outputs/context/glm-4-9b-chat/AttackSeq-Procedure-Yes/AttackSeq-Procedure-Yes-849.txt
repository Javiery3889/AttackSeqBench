1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence, as presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery
     2. Lateral Movement
     3. Collection

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks whether attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data. Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of events after discovery would be:
     - Discovery (7)
     - Lateral Movement (8)
     - Collection (9)
   - Persistence (3) is mentioned before lateral movement (8) in the outline, indicating that persistence points are established before lateral movement. However, the question specifically asks about the installation of further persistence points during lateral movement.
   - Lateral movement (8) is a phase where the attacker moves within the network to find and access other systems, users, and data. It is a logical step to install persistence points during this phase to ensure ongoing access to the network as the attacker moves around.
   - The answer choices are:
     A: Yes
     B: No

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial sequence of events after discovery is lateral movement.
   - Step 2: Persistence points are established before lateral movement to ensure ongoing access.
   - Step 3: During lateral movement, attackers would likely install further persistence points to maintain access to the network as they move to different systems and data.
   - Step 4: The question asks if this is likely, and based on the outline, it is a plausible action for attackers to take.

Final Answer: A: Yes
