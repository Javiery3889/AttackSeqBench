1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file.
     2. Execution: Enabling Macro content in the Excel file, creating a PE file, and executing it using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32.
     3. Command and Control: Establishing communication with a Kuwait-based IP address over an SSL connection using an expired digital certificate.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Execution: The Gholee malware executes through the concatenated PE file.
     2. Command and Control: The malware establishes a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the execution phase of the Gholee malware, which includes the creation of a PE file and its execution using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32. It does not explicitly mention any obfuscation or mechanisms to hide from sandbox software.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software before establishing a secure command-and-control connection.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware's behavior regarding obfuscation or evading sandbox detection.
   - The question is asking about the likelihood of the malware employing such techniques, which is not directly addressed in the outline.
   - However, given that the malware is sophisticated enough to use ASCII character codes to avoid detection and to communicate over an SSL connection with an expired certificate, it is reasonable to infer that the threat actor may have employed additional obfuscation techniques to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
