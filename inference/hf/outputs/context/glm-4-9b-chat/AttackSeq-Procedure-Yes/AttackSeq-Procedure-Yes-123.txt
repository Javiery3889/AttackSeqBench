Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection) leads to uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
- Execution: Deployment of custom malware ('IPsec Helper' .NET backdoor) for data exfiltration or deploying additional malware.
- Persistence: Deployment of webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: Use of webshells with obfuscation and 'IPsec Helper' with functionality to update its engine and delete traces.
- Lateral Movement: Use of webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and compromised accounts for lateral movement, along with offensive security tools for credential harvesting.
- Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP for commands, including updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after sending recon information or downloading files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware. However, it does describe the capabilities of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which includes sending recon information and downloading files.
- The outline does not provide any information about the intent or behavior of the threat actor regarding data destruction activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information that directly supports or contradicts the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware after sending recon information or downloading files.
- Since there is no explicit information about the threat actor's intent to use these specific tools for data destruction, we cannot conclude with certainty that they would be deployed in this sequence.
- Final Answer: B: No
