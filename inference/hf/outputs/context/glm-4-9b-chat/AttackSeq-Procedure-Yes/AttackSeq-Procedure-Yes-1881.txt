Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Discovery
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery
  2. Using tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services
  3. Collecting data from network shared drives
  4. Targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline provides information on the TTPs used by FIN13, which can be matched with the sequence in the question:
  1. The outline states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the first TTP in the question.
  2. The outline does not explicitly mention the use of Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE, but it does mention the use of JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying, which could be used for lateral movement. The use of custom web shells is also mentioned, but not specifically BUSTEDPIPE.
  3. The outline states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives, which aligns with the third TTP in the question.
  4. The outline mentions that FIN13 targets specific data that aids in fraudulent transactions, which aligns with the fourth TTP in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide explicit details on the use of Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE, but it does mention the use of JSPRAT and custom web shells, which could be analogous to the tools mentioned in the question for lateral movement.
- Given that FIN13 is known for its long-term intrusions and the need to move laterally within networks to collect data, it is plausible that they would use such tools for lateral movement.
- Therefore, the sequence of TTPs in the question is likely to be part of FIN13's attack pattern.

Final Answer: A: Yes
