Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with PowerShell commands that download malicious payloads from URLs hosted on compromised servers.
- Execution: PowerShell commands initiate the download of a malicious payload, which includes a script targeting 64-bit systems and applying hotfixes for vulnerabilities.
- Persistence: The MSI package installed by PurpleFox ensures persistence by removing old PurpleFox installations from the registry and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory.
- Command and Control: The .NET backdoor, FoxSocket, establishes a command-and-control channel with its servers using WebSockets.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that PurpleFox will install a rootkit driver and execute a .vbs script to block ports 135, 139, and 445 after ensuring persistence.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the installation of a rootkit driver or the execution of a .vbs script to block ports. The focus of the outline is on the use of PowerShell, the installation of the MSI package for persistence, and the use of FoxSocket for command and control.
- The question's answer choices are about additional actions that are not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the installation of a rootkit driver or the execution of a .vbs script to block ports.
- Since the outline does not mention these actions, we cannot conclude that they are part of the attack sequence based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
