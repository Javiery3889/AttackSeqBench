Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The CosmicDuke samples use a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and installs a Windows service to achieve persistence.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Collection: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches removable drives for files.
- Command and Control: CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Credential Access
5. Collection
6. Command and Control
7. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations before collecting information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The relevant part of the CTI outline for this question is the "Collection" section, which states that CosmicDuke searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.' However, there is no specific mention of targeting non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention targeting non-English filenames in its discovery operations.
- The "Collection" section only states that CosmicDuke searches for files on removable drives and skips certain file types and drives with a specific volume name.
- Since there is no direct evidence that CosmicDuke targets non-English filenames, we cannot conclude that it is a part of its discovery operations.

Final Answer: B: No
