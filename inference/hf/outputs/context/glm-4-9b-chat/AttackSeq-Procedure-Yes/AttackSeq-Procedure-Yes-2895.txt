Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' that contains an executable extracted and executed by macros.
- Execution: The 'yty' framework includes a downloader executable '.exe' (Downloader 1) that downloads and executes another executable, then removes itself. Another downloader, 'Setup.exe' (Downloader 2), is more functional and includes anti-sandbox detection.
- Persistence: A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' establishes persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.
- Defense Evasion: The 'yty' framework uses evasion techniques and creates logs for debugging.
- Collection: The 'yty' framework collects files, screenshots, and keystrokes using various plugins.
- Command and Control: The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to download a file from Google Docs for its C2 host and sends beacon messages with system information.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Collection
6. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the 'yty' framework is likely to exfiltrate gathered data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots back to the C2 server using automated methods described in its exfiltration mechanism.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline mentions that the 'yty' framework includes plugins for file exfiltration ('abode.exe') and system information gathering ('mboard.exe'). It also states that the framework sends beacon messages containing system information to the C2 server.

Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that the framework has the capability to exfiltrate data. The question specifically mentions the use of 'vstservice.exe' for document listing, 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging, and 'dspcheck.exe' for capturing screenshots, which are all mentioned in the collection phase of the attack. Since the framework is capable of exfiltration and has plugins designed for this purpose, it is likely that it would use automated methods to exfiltrate the gathered data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'yty' framework is capable of collecting data using various plugins.
- The framework has a mechanism for exfiltration, as indicated by the presence of an exfiltration plugin ('abode.exe').
- The C2 communication strategy suggests that the framework is designed to send data back to the C2 server.
- The question asks if the framework exfiltrates data using automated methods, which is consistent with its capabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
