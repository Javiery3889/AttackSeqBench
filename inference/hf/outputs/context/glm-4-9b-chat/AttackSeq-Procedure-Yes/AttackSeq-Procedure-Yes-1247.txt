Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Malicious Microsoft Office documents are used to download a Macro from Google Drive.
- Execution: The Macro executes if a disk serial number is detected, then downloads a base64-encoded binary from Google Drive.
- Persistence: JhoneRAT creates persistence by adding an entry to the registry.
- Defense Evasion: JhoneRAT includes techniques to avoid execution on virtual machines and analysis by tools.
- Discovery: JhoneRAT targets specific Arabic-speaking countries based on the system's keyboard layout.
- Command and Control: JhoneRAT uses cloud services for command and control activities, checking for new commands in tweets from a specific handle.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if JhoneRAT is likely to exfiltrate screenshots via ImgBB and send command execution feedback to Google Forms.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of ImgBB or Google Forms in the JhoneRAT campaign.
- The outline does state that JhoneRAT uses cloud services for command and control activities, which includes checking for new commands in tweets. However, it does not specify the use of ImgBB or Google Forms for exfiltration or feedback.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of ImgBB or Google Forms in the JhoneRAT campaign.
- Since the outline does not mention these services, we cannot conclude that they are used for exfiltration or feedback based on the provided information.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that JhoneRAT uses these services based on the information given.

Final Answer: B: No
