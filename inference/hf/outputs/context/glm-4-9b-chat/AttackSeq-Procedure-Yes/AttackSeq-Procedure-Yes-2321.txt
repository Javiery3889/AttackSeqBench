1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: Deployment of Shamoon malware.
     - Execution: Execution of the malware as a scheduled job, deletion of the job file, entrenchment as a service, and execution of the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver.
     - Persistence: Entrenchment of the malware as a service on the infected system.
     - Defense Evasion: Wiping function that overwrites data within the Documents and Settings folder, followed by the System32 folder, and then starts physical disk access to begin wiping at the disk level, including overwriting the boot records (MBR and VBR).
     - Command and Control: Development of detection rules for the malware.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After entrenching itself as a service for persistence and executing the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver for its destructive operations, the question asks if Shamoon will eventually overwrite disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the defense evasion tactic of Shamoon malware includes overwriting the disk's boot records (MBR and VBR) to prevent access to the affected file systems. This aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The outline also mentions that the malware targets both user and system data by overwriting the contents of the Documents and Settings and Windows\system32 directories.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The malware has already entrenched itself as a service and executed a dropped driver for destructive operations.
   - Step 2: The defense evasion tactic of the malware includes overwriting disk boot records.
   - Step 3: The outline specifies that the malware targets both user and system data by overwriting specific directories.
   - Step 4: Given the information provided, it is clear that the malware's behavior aligns with the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

Final Answer: A: Yes
