Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.
- Execution: The malware is deployed alongside legitimate applications, uses a service for persistence, and reconfigures Windows Defender.
- Persistence: The malware creates a service that launches the C2 contact module upon service startup.
- Defense Evasion: The malware checks for specific antiviruses and adds its directories to Windows Defender exclusions.
- Collection: The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files, compresses them, and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server.
- Command and Control: The C2 infrastructure includes new domains and uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the exfiltration phase of the attack, specifically whether the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that during the Collection phase, the malware compresses the Microsoft Office files into an archive and encodes it before sending it to the C2 server. However, there is no mention of splitting the archives into chunks.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide information about splitting the archives into chunks. It only states that the archives are compressed and encoded.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot conclude that the malware splits the archives into chunks before exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: No
