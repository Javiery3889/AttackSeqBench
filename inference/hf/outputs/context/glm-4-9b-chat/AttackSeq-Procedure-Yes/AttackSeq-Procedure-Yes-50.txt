Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
  2. Initial Access: Phishing emails deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware through the execution of VBS macros in Word documents.
  3. Execution: VBS macro executes, calling a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
  4. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads, and leverages DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
  5. Impact: GandCrab ransomware encrypts files, and Ursnif malware performs credential harvesting and system information gathering.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Evading defenses by operating in memory.
  2. Using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk.
  3. Communication with C2 servers and downloading payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes a PowerShell script that operates in memory and uses a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk, which are both defense evasion techniques.
- The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
- The outline states that the PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab malware, which implies that it would need to communicate with C2 servers to retrieve these payloads.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The PowerShell script is designed to download and execute payloads, which requires communication with C2 servers.
- The script's ability to operate in memory and use a DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk is a method of evading defenses, but it does not prevent the script from communicating with external servers.
- Given that the script is designed to deliver Ursnif and GandCrab malware, it is reasonable to assume that it will communicate with C2 servers to download these payloads.

Final Answer: A: Yes
