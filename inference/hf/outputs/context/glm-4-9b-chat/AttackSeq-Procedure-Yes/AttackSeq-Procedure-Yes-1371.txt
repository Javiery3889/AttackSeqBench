1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Reconnaissance Phase 1: Fake personas on social platforms to gather information.
     - Reconnaissance Phase 2: Long-term monitoring of targets via benign emails, use of mailing lists, and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.
     - Initial Access Phase 3: Credential harvesting through emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset, SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages, domain typo squatting, and use of anonymous domains with free SSL certificates.
     - Execution Phase 4: Hacking targets using emails with links to drive-by downloads or direct malware attachments, weaponization and reuse of malware, reuse of command and control infrastructure, and separation of spear phishing and malware C2 infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery pages.
     - Using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages.
     - Employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates on credential harvesting landing pages.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that during the Initial Access phase, the WINDSHIFT APT sends emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset, which matches the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The outline also mentions SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages, which aligns with the second TTP.
   - Lastly, the outline states that the credential harvesting landing pages use HTTPS with free SSL certificates, which corresponds to the third TTP.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline describes the WINDSHIFT APT's Reconnaissance phase, which includes long-term monitoring via benign emails and tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com.
   - Step 2: The Initial Access phase follows the Reconnaissance phase and involves credential harvesting, which includes sending emails mimicking legit password recovery pages, using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting pages, and employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates.
   - Step 3: The TTPs mentioned in the question are all part of the Initial Access phase as described in the CTI outline.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
