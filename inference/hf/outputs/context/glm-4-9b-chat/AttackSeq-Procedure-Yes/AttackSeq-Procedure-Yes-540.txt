1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and drops decoy documents and shellcode files.
     - Execution: The PIVY variant copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and executes it with the path to the DLL.
     - Persistence: The PIVY variant installs itself for automatic startup via a .lnk in the Windows Startup folder.
     - Defense Evasion: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to confuse parsing tools. It also uses non-null-padded C2 hostnames.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Defense Evasion: The PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to confuse tools parsing configuration data.
     - Command & Control (C2) Communication: The malware communicates with C2 servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the PIVY variant uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade defenses, which is consistent with the first part of the question.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the communication protocols used by the PIVY variant for C2 communication. However, it does mention that the C2s are no longer null-padded and each hostname ends with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each C2 server, which suggests a level of obfuscation in the communication method.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide direct information about the application layer protocols used for C2 communication by the PIVY variant.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate using application layer protocols, which is a broad category that includes HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and others.
   - Given that the C2 hostnames are obfuscated and the outline does not specify the protocols, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the malware will use application layer protocols without additional information.

Final Answer: B: No
