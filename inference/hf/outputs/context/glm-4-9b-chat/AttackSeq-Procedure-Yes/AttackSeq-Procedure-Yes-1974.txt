Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: The attackers use phishing emails to gain access to systems, specifically mentioning the use of genuine accounts within a client's supply chain.
  2. Lateral Movement: The report emphasizes the importance of protecting against lateral movement by attackers, which suggests that after gaining initial access, the attackers would likely move laterally within the network.
  3. Exfiltration: The report describes ransomware attacks where attackers exfiltrate data before encrypting it.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Initial Access: Using phishing emails to gain access to systems.
  2. Reconnaissance: Gathering victim organization information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if threat actors who use phishing emails to gain access to systems (as described in the CTI outline) will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention reconnaissance as a step in the attack sequence, but it does mention the importance of protecting against lateral movement, which implies that after gaining access, the attackers would likely gather information to understand the network and its vulnerabilities.
- The question specifically refers to threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya, which are known for their supply chain attacks. Given that the CTI outline discusses the use of phishing within a client's supply chain, it is reasonable to infer that these actors would gather information about the victim organization to understand their network and potential targets.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that attackers use phishing emails to gain initial access and would likely move laterally within the network.
- The question asks if these actors would gather information about the victim organization during reconnaissance, which is a plausible step after gaining access.
- Therefore, it is likely that threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks would gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

Final Answer: A: Yes
