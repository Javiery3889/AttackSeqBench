Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Defense Evasion
  6. Credential Access
  7. Discovery
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Credential Access
  2. Discovery
  3. Compromising additional endpoints

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the Carbanak group's attack sequence, which includes obtaining Domain Administrator credentials during Credential Access and then using them to compromise additional endpoints through Discovery.
- The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

Given the outline, the attackers did indeed obtain a Domain Administrator account during Credential Access. The subsequent Discovery phase involved using the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative level credentials. This indicates that the attackers were actively seeking administrative credentials, which would include the Domain Administrator account, to facilitate their movement across the infrastructure.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attackers obtained a Domain Administrator account, which is a high-level administrative credential.
- The Discovery phase involved collecting administrative level credentials, which would include the Domain Administrator account.
- The use of the Domain Administrator account is mentioned in the context of moving across the infrastructure, which suggests that the attackers were using it to gain broader access.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
