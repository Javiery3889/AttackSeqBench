1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
     2. Initial Access: TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
     3. Execution: TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
     4. Persistence: TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework for persistence.
     5. Privilege Escalation: TG1021 employed various techniques for privilege escalation.
     6. Defense Evasion: TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded detection.
     7. Credential Access: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
     8. Discovery: TG1021 used offensive security tools to gather information.
     9. Command and Control: TG1021 established command and control using an inline hook.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance.
     2. TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB.
     3. TG1021 dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention TG1021 accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB or dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader during the Lateral Movement phase. However, it does describe TG1021's use of offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit, which are consistent with the question's description of reconnaissance.
   - The outline also describes TG1021's use of NodeIISWeb, a malware that provides backdoor functionality, which could be used for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would perform these actions during the Lateral Movement phase, which is a plausible step after reconnaissance and initial access.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: TG1021 has already performed reconnaissance using SharpHound and PowerSploit, which are tools that can be used for lateral movement.
   - Step 2: TG1021 has gained initial access to the network.
   - Step 3: TG1021 has established persistence on the network with the NodeIISWeb malware.
   - Step 4: Given the context of the outline, it is reasonable to assume that TG1021 would look for opportunities to expand its presence on the network.
   - Step 5: Accessing shared folders over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader is a plausible TTP for lateral movement and compromising additional servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
