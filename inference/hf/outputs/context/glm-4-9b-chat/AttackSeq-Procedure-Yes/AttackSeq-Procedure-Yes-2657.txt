1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
     2. Execution: Custom loader executes the Korplug variant.
     3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence on the system.
     4. Defense Evasion: Use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
     5. Discovery: Korplug collects extensive system information.
     6. Collection: Korplug collects data from local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration via a custom protocol.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
     2. Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
     3. Initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
     4. Subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline states that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands, involving TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body. This matches the third and fourth points of the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, but it does mention that the campaign uses filenames that reflect current events to lure victims, which could imply a level of sophistication in the communication protocol that might include secure initial handshakes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that Korplug is capable of exfiltrating data using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - Step 2: The outline does not provide explicit information about the initial handshake method, but the use of filenames related to current events suggests a group that is sophisticated and likely to use secure communication methods.
   - Step 3: Given the context of the campaign and the sophistication of the group, it is reasonable to infer that the initial handshake might be over HTTPS or TCP to ensure secure communication.
   - Step 4: The subsequent encrypted communication over TCP is confirmed by the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
