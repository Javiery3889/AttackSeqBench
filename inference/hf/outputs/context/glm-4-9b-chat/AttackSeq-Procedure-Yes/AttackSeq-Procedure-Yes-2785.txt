1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7, with the icon hidden and the ability to restart immediately upon termination. On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
     - Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, list of installed apps, list of processes, and Wi-Fi status.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Collecting data such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location information.
     - Exfiltrating this data via HTTP requests.
     - Communicating with the C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the method of exfiltration or communication with the C&C server. However, it does describe the capabilities of the XAgent app, which includes collecting various types of information.
   - Answer Choice A suggests that the data is exfiltrated via HTTP requests and that the communication with the C&C server uses a Base64 encoded token for identification.
   - Answer Choice B suggests that the data is not exfiltrated via HTTP requests and does not use a Base64 encoded token for identification.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the exfiltration method or the communication protocol used by the XAgent app.
   - However, the question asks if it is likely that the data is exfiltrated via HTTP requests and uses a Base64 encoded token for identification.
   - Without explicit information from the CTI outline, we cannot definitively conclude that this is the case. It is possible that the data is exfiltrated using a different method or that the communication with the C&C server uses a different form of identification.
   - Therefore, we cannot confirm either answer choice based on the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided CTI outline.
