Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying, accessing remote services, obtaining information from cloud resources.
- Execution: Installation of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell, using scheduled tasks.
- Persistence: Loading beacon in memory, searching for VPN and firewall configs.
- Privilege Escalation: Password spraying against domain admin accounts, using NtdsAudit.
- Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces, using timestomping, clearing Windows event logs.
- Credential Access: Brute force credential access, credential stuffing or password spraying.
- Discovery: Using PsLogList for account discovery, using Mimikatz for credential dumping.
- Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's lateral movement capabilities, moving to domain controllers.
- Collection: Collecting data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, copying results of discovery phase.
- Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike for C2, switching from DNS to HTTPS for C2.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the adversary will execute custom-built malware to exfiltrate data to cloud storage web services after collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of custom-built malware for exfiltration. However, it does mention that the adversary uses Cobalt Strike for command and control, which is a framework that can be used for exfiltration purposes. The outline also states that the adversary collects data from various sources and uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities, which could imply that they are capable of exfiltrating data.
- The use of cloud storage web services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a plausible method for exfiltration given the nature of the data collected and the adversary's capabilities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the adversary has the capability to exfiltrate data using Cobalt Strike, which is a framework that can be used for such purposes.
- While the use of cloud storage services is not explicitly mentioned, it is a common method for exfiltrating data, especially when dealing with large chunks of data that need to be moved off the network.
- Given the adversary's capabilities and the nature of the data they are likely to collect, it is plausible that they would use a method such as exfiltrating to cloud storage services.

Final Answer: A: Yes
