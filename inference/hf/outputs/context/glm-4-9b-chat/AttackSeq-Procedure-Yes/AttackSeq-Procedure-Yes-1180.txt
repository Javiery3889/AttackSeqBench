Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with malicious delivery documents in the Tajik language targeting government and telecommunication organizations.
- Execution: The payload executes, creating files in the ProgramData directory, and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script. The VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- Persistence: The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.
- Defense Evasion: The campaign uses obfuscation and publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
- Discovery: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- Collection: The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots and sends this data to a C&C server.
- Others: The attackers monitor the C&C server and use false flags in the PowerShell script.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of an encrypted channel for communication with the C&C server. However, it does mention that the PowerShell script sends collected data to a C&C server and that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the communication channel between the backdoor and the C&C server is encrypted. However, given the sophistication of the attack and the presence of a backdoor function designed to collect and send sensitive information, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers would use encryption to secure their communication.
- The attackers' active monitoring of the C&C server suggests that they are taking measures to protect their command and control infrastructure, which could include using encrypted channels.
- Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it is likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
