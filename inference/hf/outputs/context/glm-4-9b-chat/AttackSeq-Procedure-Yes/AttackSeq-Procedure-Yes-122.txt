Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection) leads to uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
- Execution: Deploying custom malware (IPsec Helper .NET backdoor) for data exfiltration or additional malware deployment.
- Persistence: Deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation and 'IPsec Helper' with functionality to update its engine and delete traces.
- Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Agrius is likely to use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Agrius used webshells for lateral movement using RDP after initial access. This matches the first part of the question.
- The outline also mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for persistence and communication with C2 servers over HTTP, which aligns with the second part of the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence described in the CTI outline includes the use of webshells for lateral movement and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for communication with C2 servers.
- The question asks if these actions are part of the attack sequence after initial access via public-facing applications.
- Based on the information provided, the sequence of TTPs described in the question matches the sequence in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
