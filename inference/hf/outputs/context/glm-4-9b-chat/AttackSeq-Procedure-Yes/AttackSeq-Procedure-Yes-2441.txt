Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The threat group DRAGONFISH distributes Elise malware through a malicious Microsoft Word document.
- Execution: The malware uses CVE-2017-11882 to execute a malicious executable, moves the payload, and starts Internet Explorer in a suspended state, injecting the NavShExt.dll.
- Persistence: The malware uses the Run Registry key to persist on the system and injects hidden DLLs into iexplore.exe.
- Defense Evasion: The malware uses anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscation, and spoofing to evade detection.
- Discovery: The malware harvests system information and sends it to the hardcoded C2 server.
- Others: The malware can provide a remote shell, uninstall itself, and uses a hardcoded C2 server for communication.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Discovery

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the Elise malware, after collecting system information, is likely to communicate with the hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14 using an application layer protocol for Command and Control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline states that the malware sends data to and downloads files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server with the IP address 103.236.150[.]14. This indicates that communication with the C2 server is part of the malware's behavior.

The question specifically asks about the use of an application layer protocol. While the outline does not explicitly mention the protocol used, it is common for malware to use application layer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or other custom protocols for C2 communication. Given that the malware is designed to send and receive data, it is plausible that it uses an application layer protocol for this purpose.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the malware communicates with a hardcoded C2 server.
- It is common for malware to use application layer protocols for C2 communication.
- The lack of explicit mention of the protocol in the outline does not negate the likelihood of its use.

Final Answer: A: Yes
