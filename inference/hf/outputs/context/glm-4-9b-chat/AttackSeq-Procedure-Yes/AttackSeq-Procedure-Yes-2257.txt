1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file via a phishing email.
     2. Execution: Execution of the batch script that runs a PowerShell script from the Internet.
     3. Persistence: PowerShell script includes startup persistence features.
     4. Defense Evasion: Use of VMProtect packer to protect the main malicious file.
     5. Credential Access: Stealing bank credentials and accessing Outlook info.
     6. Collection: Accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI and sending email accounts via POST request.
     7. Command and Control: Communication with specific domains for malware download and data exfiltration.
     8. Exfiltration: Exfiltration of collected data through a POST web request.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial Access: Delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email.
     2. Execution: Execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
     3. Persistence: Ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the batch script executes a PowerShell script from the Internet (Execution phase). It also mentions that the PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features (Persistence phase).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Initial Access phase is confirmed by the delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email.
   - Step 2: The Execution phase is confirmed by the execution of a PowerShell script from the Internet.
   - Step 3: The Persistence phase is confirmed by the PowerShell script's inclusion of startup persistence features.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question matches the sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
