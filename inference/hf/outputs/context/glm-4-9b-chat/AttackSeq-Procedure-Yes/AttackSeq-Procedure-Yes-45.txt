Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Email attachment used as initial infection vector, social engineering to open .src file, display decoy document, execute malware.
- Execution: Execute arbitrary code on the infected host.
- Persistence: Dropped files and created shortcuts for persistence across different campaigns.
- Defense Evasion: Evolved from single file to dual file structure, decoy documents advanced, checks for previous version files.
- Credential Access: Steals keystrokes and credentials from browsers.
- Collection: Steals files, keystrokes, and performs screenshots.
- Command and Control: Communicates with C2 using HTTP connections, uses free web hosting provider for C2 infrastructure.
- Others: Malware named KONNI, authored by Paul Rascagneres, targeted public organizations, decoy documents suggest North Korea involvement.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the KONNI malware will upload stolen data, including keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure as part of its exfiltration process after communicating with the C2 using HTTP connections.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware is designed to steal files, keystrokes, and perform screenshots (Collection).
- It also states that the malware communicates with the C2 using HTTP connections for registration, uploading, and downloading files (Command and Control).

Given the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the malware is designed to exfiltrate the data it collects. Since the malware is capable of collecting keystrokes and screenshots and has the capability to communicate with the C2 infrastructure, it is likely that it will use this infrastructure to exfiltrate the stolen data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is designed to collect keystrokes and screenshots, which are forms of data.
- The malware has the capability to communicate with the C2 infrastructure using HTTP connections.
- The C2 infrastructure is used for registration, uploading, and downloading files, which implies the ability to send data to the C2.
- There is no information in the outline that suggests the malware does not exfiltrate data to the C2.

Final Answer: A: Yes
