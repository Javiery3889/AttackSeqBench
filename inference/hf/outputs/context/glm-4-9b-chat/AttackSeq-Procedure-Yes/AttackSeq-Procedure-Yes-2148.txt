1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Phishing campaigns with PE attachments and malicious macro-laden Microsoft Word documents.
     2. Execution: Execution of the FlowCloud macro, renaming files, and using certutil.exe to execute 'gup.exe'.
     3. Command and Control: FlowCloud malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands using a custom binary C2 protocol.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Execution of 'gup.exe' by the FlowCloud macro.
     2. Execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' by 'gup.exe'.
     3. Extraction and installation of payload file components for persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the execution of 'gup.exe' by the FlowCloud macro and its use of certutil.exe to execute it. However, there is no mention of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or its role in the attack sequence.
   - The question asks if it is likely that 'gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide any information about 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or its role in the attack sequence. Therefore, we cannot conclude from the provided information that 'gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' for the purpose described in the question.
   - Since there is no evidence to support the sequence of actions described in the question, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely.

Final Answer: B: No
