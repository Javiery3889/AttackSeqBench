Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection), uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
- Execution: Deploying custom malware (IPsec Helper .NET backdoor), using it to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware, registering as a service for persistence, executing commands, uploading files, and updating configuration.
- Defense Evasion: Using webshells with ASPXSpy variations and custom base64 encoding, backdoor functionality to update engine and delete traces.
- Lateral Movement: Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic, leveraging compromised accounts, and using offensive security tools for credential harvesting.
- Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP, awaits commands for updates, recon, file downloads, and self-deletion.
- Impact: Deploying wipers (Apostle, DEADWOOD) to destroy data, Apostle later turned into ransomware, DEADWOOD overwrites files and prevents user access.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware (IPsec Helper) for execution before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Agrius deployed the custom malware 'IPsec Helper' for execution, which was used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware. This indicates that the execution phase comes before achieving persistence.
- The outline also mentions that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor was registered as a service for persistence, which is a step taken to ensure that the malware remains on the system after initial execution.
- The deployment of webshells for lateral movement is mentioned as a separate step that occurs after the initial access and before the execution of the custom malware.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events in the CTI outline is as follows: Initial Access (exploiting public-facing applications), Lateral Movement (uploading webshells using RDP), Execution (deploying custom malware), Defense Evasion (using webshells and backdoor functionality), and finally, Command and Control (communicating with C2 servers).
- The question asks if the deployment of custom malware (IPsec Helper) for execution comes before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
- Based on the outline, the custom malware is deployed for execution before it is registered as a service for persistence, and webshells are deployed for lateral movement.
- Therefore, it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware for execution before achieving persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
