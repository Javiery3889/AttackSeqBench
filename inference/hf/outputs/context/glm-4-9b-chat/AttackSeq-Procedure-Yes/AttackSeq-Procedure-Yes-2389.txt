1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
     2. Initial Access: The initial access was likely through a spear-phishing email with a trojanized software installation executable.
     3. Execution: The malware (TDrop2) executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
     4. Defense Evasion: TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its payload retrieval.
     5. Discovery: The malware performed discovery activities by collecting information about the infected host.
     6. Others: The report mentions similarities with the original Dark Seoul/Operation Troy toolset, including a custom base64 alphabet and string decryption routine.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery activities to collect system and network information.
     2. Communication with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware performs discovery activities, which include collecting system and network information.
   - The "Others" section of the outline mentions that the malware uses a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine, which suggests that the malware is capable of encoding and decoding data using a custom base64 alphabet.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that the malware communicates with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands, but it does not contradict this either.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The malware performs discovery activities, which is consistent with the question's first TTP.
   - Step 2: The malware uses a custom base64 alphabet, which is consistent with the question's second TTP.
   - Step 3: The outline does not provide explicit information about the malware's communication method with C2 servers, but given the context of the "Others" section, it is plausible that the malware could use encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
   - Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices:
     A: Yes - This answer aligns with the possibility that the malware could use a custom base64 alphabet for communication.
     B: No - This answer would imply that the malware does not use a custom base64 alphabet for communication, which is not supported by the outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
