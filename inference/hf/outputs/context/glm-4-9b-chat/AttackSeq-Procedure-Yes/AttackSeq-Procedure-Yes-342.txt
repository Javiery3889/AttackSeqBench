Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Resource Development
  3. Initial Access
  4. Execution
  5. Persistence
  6. Privilege Escalation
  7. Defense Evasion
  8. Credential Access
  9. Discovery
  10. Lateral Movement
  11. Collection
  12. Exfiltration
  13. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Discovery techniques (querying the registry and identifying running processes)
  2. Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the threat actors used T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry as Discovery techniques (step 9). This matches the first part of the question's sequence.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the use of an Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications. However, it does imply that the attackers were able to move through the network to reach their objectives, which may involve the use of techniques to control remote systems (step 10, Lateral Movement).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline supports the use of Discovery techniques as part of the attack sequence.
- While the outline does not explicitly state the use of an Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications, it does suggest that the attackers were capable of lateral movement, which could imply the use of such protocols.
- Given that the question asks if it is likely that UNC2452 employed both Discovery techniques and Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control communications, the answer should be based on the likelihood of these techniques being used in sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
