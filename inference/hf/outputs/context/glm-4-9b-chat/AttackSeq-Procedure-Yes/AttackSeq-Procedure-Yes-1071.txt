Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Watering hole tactics, CVE-2020-0674, CVE-2019-5782 exploits, delivery of malware
- Execution: Chrome exploit vector, Internet Explorer exploit vector, PowerShell loader, LPE binary, dropper.dll, additional malware samples
- Privilege Escalation: LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458
- Defense Evasion: Checks for security software, aborts execution if detected
- Discovery: SLUB variant interacts with Mattermost server, exfiltrates system information and captures screenshots
- Command and Control: SLUB malware communicates with Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443, creates channels, and uses notification channels

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the SLUB malware will exfiltrate system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server during the Exfiltration phase after collecting and capturing them during the Discovery phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the SLUB malware variant communicates with a Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443. It also states that the malware creates individual channels for each infected machine and uses a notification channel for real-time updates on new infections.
- The fact that the malware is already interacting with the Mattermost server for discovery purposes suggests that it has the capability to communicate with the server for other purposes, such as exfiltration.
- The outline does not explicitly state that the exfiltration will occur via the same server, but given the context and the use of the Mattermost server for command and control, it is reasonable to infer that the same server would be used for exfiltration as well.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SLUB malware variant is designed to interact with a Mattermost server, which is used for both discovery and command and control.
- The malware has already established a connection with the server for discovery purposes.
- It is logical to assume that the same server would be used for exfiltration, as it is the primary means of communication for the malware's command and control activities.
- Therefore, it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server as part of the Exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
