1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Persistence: The group drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access.
     2. Command and Control: APT29 deploys custom malware known as WellMess or WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim's system.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. APT29 uses publicly available exploits to gain a foothold for initial access.
     2. The group will drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials on compromised systems to maintain persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline states that the group "likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access." This directly aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT29 will drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials after gaining initial access. The CTI outline provides evidence that this is indeed a likely action by the group.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline clearly states that APT29 is likely to maintain persistence by dropping further tooling and obtaining legitimate credentials.
   - Step 2: The question asks about the likelihood of this action following initial access.
   - Step 3: The information from the CTI outline supports the action described in the question.
   - Step 4: Therefore, the answer to the question is consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
