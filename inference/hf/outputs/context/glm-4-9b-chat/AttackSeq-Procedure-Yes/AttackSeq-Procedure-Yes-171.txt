Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a malicious email containing trojaned Microsoft Word documents (.doc) that drop the 'Surtr' malware.
- Execution: 'Surtr' malware creates a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process.
- Persistence: 'Surtr' adds a registry key for persistence and stores C2 information and a campaign code in the registry.
- Defense Evasion: 'Surtr' uses a Microsoft Word vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) to execute, evades antivirus detection, and pads the resource section to evade heuristics.
- Discovery: 'Surtr' has capabilities to list file directories, view web cache, execute remote commands, and log keystrokes, and creates folders for temporary information.
- Others: 'Surtr' monitors mailing lists for content repurposing, can download additional components like 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0', and has been used with 'LURK0' malware.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if 'Surtr' will connect to a C2 and download a stage two component after discovering file directories and contents and creating folders for temporary information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly state that 'Surtr' will connect to a C2 and download a stage two component immediately after the discovery phase. However, the 'Others' section mentions that 'Surtr' can download additional components like 'GmRemote' or 'LURK0', which suggests that it is capable of such actions.
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: discover file directories, create folders for temporary information, connect to C2, and download a stage two component.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The 'Surtr' malware is designed to be persistent and has the capability to download additional components, which implies that it is likely to perform actions such as connecting to a C2 and downloading a stage two component after it has gathered information about the victim's system.
- The 'Others' section of the CTI outline indicates that 'Surtr' has been used in conjunction with other malware, which further supports the idea that it can download additional components.
- While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that this sequence of actions will occur immediately after the discovery phase, the capabilities of the malware suggest that it is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
