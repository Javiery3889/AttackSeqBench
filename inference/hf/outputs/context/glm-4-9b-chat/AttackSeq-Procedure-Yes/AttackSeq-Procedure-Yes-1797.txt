1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) by embedding it within a webpage of the PCA.
     2. Defense Evasion: Used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
     3. Command and Control: Connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Exploiting the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access.
     2. Using the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading.
     3. Evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of a sideloading technique to evade defenses, which aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question. However, the outline does not specifically mention the dropper executable Rdws.exe.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading. The CTI outline does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the use of Rdws.exe.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms the use of a sideloading technique for defense evasion, which is consistent with the second TTP in the question.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline does not mention the specific dropper executable Rdws.exe, which is the key detail in the third TTP of the question.
   - Step 3: Without explicit mention of Rdws.exe in the CTI outline, we cannot definitively conclude that it was used for DLL sideloading.

Final Answer: B: No
