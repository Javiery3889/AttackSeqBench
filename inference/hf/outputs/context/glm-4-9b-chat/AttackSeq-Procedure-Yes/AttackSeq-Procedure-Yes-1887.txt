Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration
  12. Others

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing
  2. Leveraging native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts
  3. Using WMI for lateral movement across the victim network

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline provides information on the TTPs used by FIN13, which includes credential access and lateral movement. Specifically, it mentions that FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials (Credential Access) and uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally (Lateral Movement).
- The question asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance before using WMI for lateral movement. The outline does not explicitly state that they use native OS binaries and scripts for this purpose, but it does mention that they use various methods for persistence and lateral movement, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and using utilities like certutil, which could be indicative of using native OS binaries and scripts.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: FIN13 is known to use a variety of tools and techniques for persistence and lateral movement.
- Step 2: The outline suggests that FIN13 is adaptable and uses legitimate utilities like certutil, which could imply the use of native OS binaries and scripts.
- Step 3: The question asks if they use these techniques for internal reconnaissance before using WMI for lateral movement, which is a plausible sequence of actions given their tactics.
- Final Answer: A: Yes
