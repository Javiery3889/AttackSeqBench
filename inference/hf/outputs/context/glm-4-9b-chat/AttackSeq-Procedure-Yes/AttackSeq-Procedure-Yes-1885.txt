Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Persistence
  4. Privilege Escalation
  5. Defense Evasion
  6. Credential Access
  7. Discovery
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration
  12. Others

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access
  2. Employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE
  3. Use other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, which aligns with the first TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline also mentions that FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK. This suggests that they would use tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence, which aligns with the third TTP in the question.
- The outline does not explicitly mention BLUEAGAVE being used as a passive backdoor before deploying other persistence methods. However, it does state that FIN13 uses passive backdoors for stealth, which could imply that they might use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor as part of their persistence strategy.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses passive backdoors for stealth, which could include BLUEAGAVE. This suggests that they might use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor before using other methods for persistence.
- The outline also shows that FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, which could include both BLUEAGAVE and the tools mentioned in the question.
- Therefore, it is plausible that after deploying web shells and custom malware for initial access, FIN13 would employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
