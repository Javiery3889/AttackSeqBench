Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
  2. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising and compromised websites.
  3. Execution: RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
  4. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the use of proxy servers for defense evasion and the potential use of a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encrypted exploit code.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect, which is a clear indication of defense evasion (Step 1).
- The question asks if it is likely that RIG EK's exploit server will return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of RC4 or any encryption method for the exploit code.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the encryption method used by RIG EK for its exploit code. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encrypted exploit code based on the provided information.
- Since the use of RC4 is not mentioned in the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that RIG EK's exploit server will return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

Final Answer: B: No
