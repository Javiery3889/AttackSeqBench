1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: The QuasarRAT loader arrives as a 64-bit service DLL, using CppHostCLR to decrypt, load, and invoke an embedded .NET assembly in-memory.
     2. Execution: The assembly is obfuscated with ConfuserEx and is responsible for decrypting and executing a separate malicious .NET module stored in the %WINDOWS%\Microsoft.NET directory.
     3. Execution: The final payload assembly is stored as an encrypted file under the Microsoft.NET Framework directory and is decrypted and loaded in-memory as "Client".
     4. Persistence: The QuasarRAT backdoor achieves persistence by installing the RAT as a service, known as DILLJUICE.
     5. Defense Evasion: The QuasarRAT loader uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.
     6. Others: The threat actor modified the original QuasarRAT backdoor, adding their own field in the configuration, and code for checking Internet connectivity.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.
     2. Communicating with a command and control (C2) server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of AES-128 encryption in the context of the threat actor's modification to the QuasarRAT backdoor. The outline states that the threat actor added code for checking Internet connectivity and specified that if a valid URL address is specified in the last value of the configuration, the malware will try to download the content of that URL and proceed with connecting to the C2 server only once the download is successful.
   - The question asks if it is likely that QuasarRAT will communicate with a C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration. The outline does not explicitly state that the communication is AES-128 encrypted, but it does mention that the threat actor specified encryption in the configuration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the threat actor has specified encryption in the configuration of the QuasarRAT backdoor.
   - Step 2: The threat actor's modification includes code for checking Internet connectivity and downloading content from a specified URL.
   - Step 3: The outline does not explicitly mention AES-128 encryption, but it does suggest that the threat actor has configured the malware to use encrypted communication.
   - Step 4: Given the context that the threat actor has specified encryption in the configuration, it is reasonable to infer that the communication with the C2 server would use the specified encryption method.

Final Answer: A: Yes
