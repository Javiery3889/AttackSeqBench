1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline is as follows:
     - Discovery: The report discusses the discovery of various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces.
     - Others: The report also notes the presence of medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that support MQTT protocol and are discoverable online.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Using Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations.
     - Uncovering outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline suggests that cybercriminals would discover services on medical network perimeters, which includes outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol.
   - The question asks if it is likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover these specific systems and devices after using Shodan and Censys.
   - The use of Shodan and Censys is a method for discovering publicly available resources, which aligns with the first part of the attack sequence in the CTI outline.
   - The second part of the attack sequence in the CTI outline involves uncovering outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol, which is directly related to the question's second part.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that cybercriminals would discover services on medical network perimeters, which includes the systems and devices mentioned in the question.
   - Step 2: The question's scenario involves using Shodan and Censys, which is a method of discovery, aligning with the first part of the attack sequence.
   - Step 3: The second part of the attack sequence involves uncovering specific types of devices, which is also mentioned in the question.
   - Step 4: Given that the question's scenario is a direct continuation of the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, it is reasonable to conclude that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover the mentioned systems and devices.

Final Answer: A: Yes
