Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with the distribution of a zip file via email, containing a decoy Word document that is actually an application bundle with executable code.
- Execution: The backdoor executes, opens a password-protected Word document, and copies it to the executable path.
- Persistence: The backdoor creates a Launch Agent for startup execution, copies itself to a user-specific location, and deletes the original application bundle.
- Defense Evasion: The backdoor uses obfuscation techniques and a custom binary protocol with encryption.
- Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with a C2 server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, with encrypted commands and responses.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server after achieving persistence.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the backdoor surveying the victim's computer and sending system information to the C2 server. However, the Command and Control phase of the attack does involve the backdoor communicating with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol with encryption.
- The question seems to be asking about a potential action that could occur after persistence is achieved, which is within the scope of the Command and Control phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The OceanLotus backdoor is designed to communicate with a command and control server, which implies that it can send information back to the server.
- The backdoor's ability to communicate with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol with encryption suggests that it can send encrypted data.
- The question asks if the backdoor will send "encrypted details about system information," which is a plausible action for a backdoor to perform after achieving persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
