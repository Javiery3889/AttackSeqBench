1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Stolen credentials are used to gain access, followed by setting up remote tunneling with SSH tools.
     2. Execution: Malicious code is executed using scheduled tasks, scripts, encrypted files, and PowerShell loader.
     3. Defense Evasion: Techniques like process injection and deobfuscation are used.
     4. Discovery: The SombRAT backdoor performs process, system information, and system time discovery, along with network service scanning.
     5. Collection: Collected data is archived using a custom storage file format.
     6. Command and Control: The SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. The CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     2. The SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.
     3. The use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges. This suggests that the communication channel is secure and designed to protect the data being transmitted.
   - Given that the C2 communication is SSL-encrypted and the AES key exchange is RSA-secured, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over this secure channel, as it is designed to do so without exposing the data to potential interception or tampering.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline describes the secure nature of the C2 communication channel.
   - Step 2: The SombRAT backdoor is designed to communicate with C2 servers and exfiltrate data.
   - Step 3: The use of SSL and RSA encryption indicates a high level of security for the data transmission.
   - Step 4: Based on the security measures in place, it is reasonable to conclude that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

Final Answer: A: Yes
