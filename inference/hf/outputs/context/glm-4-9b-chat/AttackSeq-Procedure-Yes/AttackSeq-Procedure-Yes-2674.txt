1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: The malware ZoxPNG is executed on the victim's machine.
     2. Defense Evasion: ZoxPNG uses the WinInet API for HTTP communication and includes a VictimSystemData structure in the HTTP Cookie header for detection purposes.
     3. Command and Control: ZoxPNG communicates with the C2 server using a polling model, sending and receiving data in the form of HTTP GET and POST requests with PNG files.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Execution of arbitrary code supported by ZoxPNG.
     2. C2 server responding with a PNG file containing the next instruction.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that ZoxPNG communicates with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests with PNG files. This suggests that the data transmission between the malware and the C2 server is indeed done through PNG files.
   - The question asks if the C2 server will respond with a PNG file containing the next instruction after arbitrary code execution. Based on the CTI outline, this is a plausible scenario since the communication pattern includes PNG files for instructions or data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: ZoxPNG is executed and communicates with the C2 server using HTTP GET and POST requests with PNG files.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline specifies that the communication includes PNG files for instructions or data.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the C2 server will respond with a PNG file after arbitrary code execution, which aligns with the communication pattern described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
