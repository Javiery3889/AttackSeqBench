1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed on iOS 7, hidden, and runs in the background. It is noted that the app's icon is hidden and it restarts immediately if terminated.
     - Command and Control: The app collects information from the iOS device, sends it out via HTTP using POST and GET requests, and receives commands in the same manner. It uses a token to identify modules and can upload files via FTP.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - The XAgent app executes by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices.
     - The app collects a list of processes for discovery.
     - The app sends the gathered information, including processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the collection of a list of processes for discovery before sending information to the C2 server. However, it does describe the app's functionality, which includes collecting information from the iOS device and sending it out via HTTP.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the information. Given that the app is designed to collect information from the iOS device, it is plausible that it would collect a list of processes as part of its information collection process.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7 devices.
   - Step 2: The app is designed to collect information from the device.
   - Step 3: The information collection process typically includes gathering details about the system, such as running processes.
   - Step 4: The collected information is sent to the C2 server via HTTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
