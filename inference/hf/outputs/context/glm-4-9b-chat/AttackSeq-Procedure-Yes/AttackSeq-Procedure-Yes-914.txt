1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: The Tuyul botnet executes commands on victim systems.
     - Persistence: The malware maintains persistence by downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
     - Defense Evasion: The malware uses a binary version to evade antivirus detection and employs PHP web shells for access.
     - Command and Control: The botnet uses a C&C server for command and control.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access.
     - Executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.
     - Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the exploitation of CVE-2017-9841, but it does describe the Tuyul malware's capabilities and behavior.
   - The Tuyul malware is capable of executing Perl scripts and shell commands, as mentioned in the outline under the Execution section.
   - The outline also states that the malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron', which aligns with the second part of the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Tuyul malware is capable of executing Perl scripts and shell commands, which is consistent with the question's first part.
   - The malware's persistence mechanism involves downloading a bash script named 'cron', which is also consistent with the question's second part.
   - Although the initial exploitation of CVE-2017-9841 is not mentioned in the outline, the question seems to be asking if the malware will execute these actions after gaining access, not how it gains access.
   - Given that the malware is capable of the actions described in the question, it is plausible that it would execute Perl scripts and shell commands before maintaining persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
