Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: The attack leverages a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-13720, in Google Chrome.
  2. Persistence: The malware installs tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
  3. Command and Control: The malware downloads the next stage from a hardcoded C2 server.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Malicious JavaScript code is inserted into a Korean-language news portal.
  2. The code redirects victims to an exploit landing page.
  3. The exploit targets CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that the attack involved a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal, where malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the main page to redirect victims to the exploit landing page. This matches the first TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline also mentions that the exploit leverages CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, which aligns with the second TTP in the question.
- The question asks if these actions are likely to have occurred before the attackers utilized heap spraying techniques. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention heap spraying, but it does describe the initial access phase, which includes the insertion of the malicious JavaScript code and the exploitation of the Chrome vulnerability.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access phase described in the CTI outline includes the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal and the redirection of victims to an exploit landing page, which is consistent with the first two TTPs in the question.
- The question asks if these actions are likely to have occurred before heap spraying techniques were used. Since the initial access phase is a prerequisite for the exploitation of CVE-2019-13720, it is reasonable to infer that these actions took place before the use of heap spraying.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is likely to be "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
