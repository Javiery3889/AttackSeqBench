Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations, specifically the Turkish financial system, with a return of Bankshot malware.
  2. Initial Access: Financial organizations in Turkey are targeted via spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document containing an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
  3. Execution: The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document and downloads the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.
  4. Persistence: Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network for further exploitation.
  5. Defense Evasion: The Bankshot implant contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system.
  6. Command and Control: The implants communicate with hardcoded control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Targeting Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document.
  2. Exploiting CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access.
  3. Developing Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if it is likely that Hidden Cobra will develop Bankshot implants with the specified capabilities as part of the Resource Development tactic.
- The CTI outline indicates that Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation and contains functionality to wipe files, which suggests that it is capable of giving attackers full control over victim systems and erasing evidence.
- The Resource Development tactic typically involves the development and refinement of tools, techniques, and infrastructure used in an attack. The outline describes the development of the Bankshot implant, which is a tool used in the attack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Bankshot implant is explicitly mentioned to be designed to persist on a victim's network and has the capability to wipe files, which aligns with the question's description of full control over victim systems and file wiping.
- The development of the Bankshot implant is part of the attack's execution phase, which is a direct result of the initial access gained through the spear phishing email and the CVE-2018-4878 exploit.
- Given that the Bankshot implant is a tool used in the attack and is designed to provide the described capabilities, it is reasonable to conclude that the development of such an implant is part of the Resource Development tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
