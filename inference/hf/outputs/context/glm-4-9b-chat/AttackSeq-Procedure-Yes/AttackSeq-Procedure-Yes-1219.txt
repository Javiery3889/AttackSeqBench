Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
- Execution: APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
- Privilege Escalation: The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
- Defense Evasion: APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
- Credential Access: The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
- Lateral Movement: APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
- Command and Control: The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
- Exfiltration: The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Defense Evasion
5. Credential Access
6. Lateral Movement
7. Command and Control
8. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if APT10 is likely to compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR before exfiltrating this data to a Dropbox account via the cURL for Windows command-line tool.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Compress proprietary data using WinRAR
2. Exfiltrate data to a Dropbox account using cURL for Windows

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API. This directly aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
- The outline does not specify the exact order in which WinRAR and cURL were used, but it does state that they were used for the purpose of exfiltration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the attackers used WinRAR and cURL for Windows as part of their exfiltration process.
- The question asks if the attackers would use WinRAR to compress data before exfiltration, which is a plausible step in the context of exfiltration to ensure that the data is more manageable and to evade detection.
- Given that the attackers have already shown the use of these tools in their exfiltration process, it is reasonable to conclude that they would use them in a similar manner as part of their overall attack.

Final Answer: A: Yes
