Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a Flash zero-day exploit delivered through a Microsoft Office document.
- Execution: The Flash object extracts the exploit using a custom packer, which leads to arbitrary read/write operations in memory, enabling the execution of a second stage shellcode.
- Defense Evasion: The FinSpy malware uses anti-analysis techniques, including a custom packer and a virtual machine to execute code.
- Exfiltration: The second stage shellcode downloads the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document, then executes the payload and displays the lure document.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Defense Evasion
4. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the second stage shellcode, after gaining arbitrary read/write memory capabilities, will download the final payload (FinSpy) and establish communication with C2 servers for further control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the second stage shellcode downloads the final payload (FinSpy) and a lure document, then executes the payload and displays the lure document. This aligns with the question's description of the second stage shellcode's actions.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the establishment of communication with C2 servers for further control. However, given that the FinSpy malware is designed to be controlled remotely, it is reasonable to infer that it would attempt to communicate with its Command and Control (C2) servers after downloading and executing.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The second stage shellcode is responsible for executing the final payload (FinSpy) and displaying a lure document, which is consistent with the question's description.
- While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that the shellcode establishes communication with C2 servers, it is a common behavior for such malware to do so for further control.
- Therefore, it is likely that the second stage shellcode will download the final payload and establish communication with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
