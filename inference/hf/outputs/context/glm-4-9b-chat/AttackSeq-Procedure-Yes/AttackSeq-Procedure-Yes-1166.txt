1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
     2. Discovery: Using malware with espionage capabilities for system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
     3. Collection: Malware with extensive commands for remote control and customization for espionage operations.
     4. Command and Control: Configuring specific domain and IP address combinations for C&C servers, using privacy services.
     5. Exfiltration: Communicating externally with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial Access: Exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in a Word document.
     2. Discovery: Performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes Longhorn's attack sequence, which includes the initial access phase where they exploit a zero-day vulnerability to infect a target with Plexor malware. The outline also mentions that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting capabilities.
   - The question asks if Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.
   - The Vault 7 documents are known to contain information on various cyber espionage tools and techniques used by the NSA and other entities. These guidelines are likely to include tactics to avoid detection, such as using stealthy communication methods, evading antivirus software, and other countermeasures.
   - The CTI outline indicates that Longhorn's malware uses operational security measures to remain undetected, which suggests that they are likely to follow such guidelines.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Longhorn's initial access is through a zero-day vulnerability, which is a common method used by sophisticated threat actors to gain a foothold in a target's network.
   - Step 2: The malware they use is designed for espionage, which implies that it is likely to be equipped with advanced capabilities to avoid detection.
   - Step 3: The outline states that Longhorn's malware uses operational security measures to remain undetected, which aligns with the idea that they would follow guidelines to avoid detection.
   - Step 4: The question asks if Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting, which is a critical step in their attack sequence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
