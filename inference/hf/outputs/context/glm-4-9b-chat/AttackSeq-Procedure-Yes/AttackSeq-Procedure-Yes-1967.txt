Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The StellarParticle campaign gained access via SSH and RDP, used VPNs, and exported Chrome browser passwords.
- Persistence: Used credential hopping, Delegated Administrator rights, WMI persistence, crontab entry, and O365 Service Principals for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: Stole browser cookies, renamed utilities, and renamed systems to bypass MFA and masquerade.
- Credential Access: Stole web session cookies, used RDP with privileged and non-privileged accounts, and accessed data from Information Repositories.
- Discovery: Used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify Active Directory information.
- Lateral Movement: Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment before accessing data from Information Repositories.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment (Lateral Movement). This suggests that the threat actor had access to different levels of access rights.
- The question specifically mentions the use of RDP for lateral movement. Since the outline states that the threat actor used RDP for lateral movement, it is reasonable to assume that they would have used both types of accounts to achieve this.
- The outline also mentions that the threat actor accessed data from Information Repositories, which is a step that would likely occur after lateral movement within the network.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP, which is a technique used for lateral movement.
- The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used these accounts for lateral movement before accessing data from Information Repositories.
- Given the outlined sequence of events, it is logical to conclude that the threat actor would have used these accounts for lateral movement as part of their overall attack strategy.

Final Answer: A: Yes
