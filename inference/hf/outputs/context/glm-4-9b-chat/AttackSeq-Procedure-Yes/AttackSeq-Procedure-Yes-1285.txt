Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Exploits CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands, download and install an installer package (.msi).
- Execution: Installer drops a backdoor installer, which drops a sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader, and an encrypted configuration file. sidebar.exe is launched by UserInstall.exe using BITSadmin. The loader uses DLL hijacking to launch dllhost.exe and injects a DLL backdoor into it.
- Persistence: Backdoor loads and decrypts the encrypted configuration file, then uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.
- Defense Evasion: DLL hijacking is used to evade antivirus detection, and the installer drops files and creates a hidden directory to mislead.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase after using DLL hijacking for Defense Evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the backdoor will load the encrypted configuration file and decrypt it, then use SSL to connect to C&C servers. This indicates that the use of SSL is part of the backdoor's functionality.
- The question specifically mentions the use of SSL in the Command and Control phase, which is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline directly states that the backdoor uses SSL to connect to C&C servers, which is the same as the TTP mentioned in the question.
- The use of SSL is a clear and direct method of communication between the backdoor and the C&C server, as mentioned in the Defense Evasion phase.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
