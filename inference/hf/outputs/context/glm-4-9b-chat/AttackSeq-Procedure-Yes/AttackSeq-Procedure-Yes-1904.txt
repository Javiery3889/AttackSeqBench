1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Phishing campaign with emails mimicking the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax, containing a zip file with a VBScript dropper.
     2. Execution: The VBScript dropper downloads and executes 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip', which contain additional code for the Lampion trojan.
     3. Persistence: The Lampion trojan creates a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder and a new VBS file to execute the trojan at system startup.
     4. Defense Evasion: The trojan uses anti-debug and anti-VM techniques, VMProtect 3.x, and junk data to evade detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. The Lampion trojan achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file and a new VBS file.
     2. The question asks if the malware will communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control (C2) purposes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a C2 server or the communication protocol used by the Lampion trojan. However, it does mention that the trojan is designed to achieve persistence on the victim's system, which is a common characteristic of malware that requires ongoing command and control.
   - Given that the trojan is designed to operate persistently and evade detection, it is plausible that it would communicate with a C2 server to receive commands and send collected data. This is a common behavior for malware to maintain its presence on a compromised system and to exfiltrate data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Lampion trojan is designed to persist on the system, which suggests the need for ongoing communication.
   - Step 2: The trojan's ability to evade detection implies that it would likely use a method that is less likely to be blocked by security measures.
   - Step 3: The use of an application layer protocol for C2 communication is a common and effective method for malware to communicate with its command and control server.
   - Step 4: Based on the plausible need for persistent communication and the common use of application layer protocols for C2, it is likely that the malware will communicate with a C2 server using an application layer protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
