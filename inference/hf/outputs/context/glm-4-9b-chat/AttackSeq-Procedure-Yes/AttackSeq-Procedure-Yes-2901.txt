Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe. RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output, differing from the other backdoors by installing persistently and communicating over DNS rather than HTTP.
- Persistence: The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
- Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which facilitated further actions within the network.
- Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
- Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
- Collection: APT15 used tools like CSVDE to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory and BCP from Microsoft SQL to export data from databases. They also used bespoke tools to extract information from Microsoft Sharepoint and Microsoft Exchange, with the Sharepoint tool containing hardcoded project names specific to the victim.
- Others: NCC Group tracked APT15's movements over more than a year by decoding over 200 commands from several compromised hosts. Ahmed Zaki, a senior malware researcher at NCC Group, highlighted the sophistication of APT15 and the importance of knowledge sharing in the security industry. The article was published on 10 March 2018.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Execution: Deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS)
2. Persistence: Installation of RoyalDNS for persistent access
3. Privilege Escalation: Use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials
4. Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings
5. Credential Access: Use of Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and steal a VPN certificate
6. Collection: Use of various tools to export data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution after obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS)
2. Leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that RoyalCLI was used to bypass command prompt policy settings, which is part of the Execution phase. This TTP is mentioned before the Privilege Escalation phase where Mimikatz was used to gain domain administrator credentials.
- The question asks if the deployment of backdoors and the use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings occurred after APT15 obtained domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate. According to the CTI outline, the deployment of backdoors and the use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings happened before the Privilege Escalation phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that the deployment of backdoors and the use of RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings occurred before the Privilege Escalation phase, which is when APT15 gained domain administrator credentials.
- The question asks if these actions occurred after obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate, which is not supported by the CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
