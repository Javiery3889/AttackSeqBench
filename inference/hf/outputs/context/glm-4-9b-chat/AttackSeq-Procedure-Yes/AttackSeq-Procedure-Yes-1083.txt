Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used malicious documents to deliver the payload and system utilities for reconnaissance.
  2. Initial Access: The attackers gained initial access through malicious documents opened by employees.
  3. Execution: The Lazarus Group executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor.
  4. Persistence: The group created services and shortcuts for persistence.
  5. Privilege Escalation: Privileges were escalated by creating local administrator accounts.
  6. Defense Evasion: The group used various techniques to evade detection.
  7. Discovery: The group collected information about the network using system utilities.
  8. Lateral Movement: The group used compromised accounts for lateral movement and a self-designed encryption algorithm for C2 communication.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The Lazarus Group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
  2. The group communicated with their C2 servers using a self-designed encryption algorithm.
  3. The question asks if it is likely that their malware leveraged the HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the protocol used by the malware to connect to C2 servers. However, it does mention that the group used a self-designed encryption algorithm for communication with C2 servers. This suggests that the communication might not be using standard protocols like HTTP, which are typically not encrypted in the same way as the VEST algorithm mentioned in the outline.
- The outline also states that the C2 servers were disguised as legitimate domains and hosted on resources located in various countries. This is a common tactic used by sophisticated attackers to evade detection and make it harder to trace the C2 infrastructure.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the malware used the HTTP protocol for C2 communication. However, given the sophistication of the Lazarus Group and their use of a self-designed encryption algorithm, it is plausible that they would use a protocol that is less common and harder to detect, such as HTTPS, which is encrypted and can mimic legitimate traffic.
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware leveraged the HTTP protocol. Since HTTP is not encrypted and is a common protocol, it is less likely that the Lazarus Group would use it for their C2 communication, especially if they are trying to evade detection.
- Final Answer: B: No
