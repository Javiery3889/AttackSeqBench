Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Execution: The malware executes and reads its configuration, loads a DLL module, and saves stolen data with a ".a" extension in the %TEMP% directory.
- Defense Evasion: The malware uses XOR encoding for configuration files and encrypted channels for C2 communication.
- Discovery: The malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration, as well as data from SNS applications, and processes it.
- Collection: The malware collects data from various sources, including SNS applications, and categorizes it into different directories.
- Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates the collected data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
- Others: Additional context about the threat actor and malware capabilities.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Execution
2. Defense Evasion
3. Discovery
4. Collection
5. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will steal information from SNS applications and encrypt this data using AES before communicating with C2 servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Steal information from SNS applications
2. Encrypt this data using AES
3. Communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that WinDealer collects data from SNS applications (Discovery and Collection phases).
- It also mentions that the malware encrypts stolen information using AES before sending it to a C2 server (Exfiltration phase).
- The outline does not specify the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication. However, the use of non-standard ports is a common technique for evading detection, and while not explicitly mentioned, it is plausible that the malware could use such ports given its defense evasion capabilities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is designed to steal information from SNS applications, which is supported by the CTI outline.
- The outline also indicates that the malware encrypts the stolen data using AES before exfiltration, which aligns with the question's second point.
- While the use of non-standard ports is not explicitly mentioned, it is a plausible TTP for a malware designed to evade detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
