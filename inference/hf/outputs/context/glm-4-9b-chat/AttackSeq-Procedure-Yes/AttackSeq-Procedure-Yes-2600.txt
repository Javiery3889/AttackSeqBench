Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing emails deliver NanHaiShu malware with attached XLS or DOC files containing a VBA macro.
- Execution: Malicious macro runs, writes JScript data, creates decoy files, and modifies the '%regrun%' registry.
- Persistence: Modifies '%regrun%' registry to ensure autostart.
- Defense Evasion: Uses base64 encoding and obfuscation to hide the JScript and decoy XLS file.
- Discovery: Gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
- Exfiltration: Receives and executes additional JScript and VBScript code for potential data exfiltration.
- Others: Threat actor is believed to be of Chinese origin, targeting entities in the South China Sea dispute.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if NanHaiShu is likely to communicate with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET after gathering system information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. It also states that the malware is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code, which can be used for exfiltration of data.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP POST and HTTP GET for communication with the C&C server. However, it does mention that the malware is capable of receiving and executing additional code, which implies some form of communication is necessary for the exfiltration process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of the use of HTTP POST and HTTP GET for communication with the C&C server. However, given that the malware is designed to receive and execute additional code, it is plausible that it would use some form of network communication to do so.
- The absence of specific details about the communication protocol in the outline does not allow for a definitive conclusion, but the context suggests that some form of network communication is likely.

Final Answer: A: Yes
