1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploitation of Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
     2. Collection: Distribution of malicious HWP files impersonating government inquiries or job-related documents to target specific professions or groups.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access.
     2. Shifting attack methods by using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.
     3. Targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes an attack that starts with the exploitation of a vulnerability in HWP files for initial access, followed by the collection of information through targeted impersonated documents.
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will shift their attack methods by using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents.

   - Answer Choice A: Yes
     - This answer suggests that the attackers will use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups. The CTI outline mentions the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms, which could imply that attackers might evolve their methods.

   - Answer Choice B: No
     - This answer suggests that the attackers will not shift their attack methods to use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups. There is no direct evidence in the CTI outline to support this, but the outline does mention the possibility of changes in malicious EPS file forms, which could indicate that the attackers are indeed evolving their methods.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attackers are already using malicious HWP files for initial access and impersonating government inquiries or job-related documents for collection. The mention of the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms suggests that the attackers are adaptable and may evolve their tactics.
   - While the outline does not explicitly state that they will use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files, it does imply that they are open to changing their methods to evade detection.
   - Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers might shift their attack methods to include the use of simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups.

Final Answer: A: Yes
