Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered in a ZIP file, containing encrypted script data and an external template with malicious VBA macros.
- Execution: The VBA macros download a PowerShell script and a base64 encoded PowerShell code, which are then executed to download a zip file containing the malware payload.
- Defense Evasion: The campaign uses various techniques to evade detection, including switching the malicious external template to a benign one and using image files to conceal components.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Bandook campaign is likely to use the Process Hollowing technique within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload before employing AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not mention the use of Process Hollowing or Internet Explorer in the attack sequence. It does mention the use of image files to conceal components, which is a form of Defense Evasion.
- The question specifically asks about the use of Process Hollowing and AES encryption, which are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of Process Hollowing or Internet Explorer in the Bandook campaign.
- Since the outline does not mention these techniques, we cannot conclude that they are part of the attack sequence based on the provided information.
- Therefore, the answer to whether the Bandook campaign is likely to use Process Hollowing and AES encryption cannot be determined from the given CTI outline.

Final Answer: B: No
