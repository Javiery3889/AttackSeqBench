Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing email with malicious .DOC file exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop "net.exe".
  2. Persistence: Installation of the main C&C module "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service and use of mutexes to ensure single instance.
  3. Command and Control: Communication with specified C&C servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Ensuring persistence by registering the main C&C module as a service.
  2. Using mutexes to prevent multiple instances.
  3. Using a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate C&C server information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of encryption to obfuscate C&C server information. However, it does describe the use of a C&C module and communication with specific servers, which implies some form of communication obfuscation or encryption could be in place.
- Answer Choice A suggests that the malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration.
- Answer Choice B suggests that the malware will not use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the use of encryption for C&C server information. However, given that the NetTraveler APT is known for its sophisticated methods, it is plausible that it would use some form of encryption to protect its C&C server information.
- While the outline does not specify the type of encryption or whether it is simple, the presence of C&C servers and the need to communicate with them suggests that some form of obfuscation or encryption is likely.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
