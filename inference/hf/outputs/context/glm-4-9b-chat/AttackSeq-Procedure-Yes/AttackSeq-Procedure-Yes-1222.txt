Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
- Execution: APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
- Privilege Escalation: The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
- Defense Evasion: APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
- Lateral Movement: APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
- Collection: APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
- Command and Control: The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
- Exfiltration: The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Defense Evasion
5. Lateral Movement
6. Collection
7. Command and Control
8. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will use Mimikatz to enable credential theft, access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, and deploy Trochilus to copy the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Credential Theft
2. Access to Microsoft Active Directory domain controller
3. Deployment of Trochilus to copy the NTDS.DIT database file

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The CTI outline does not mention the use of Mimikatz or the copying of the NTDS.DIT database file. The closest TTPs to the question are the Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion steps, which involve the use of DLL sideloading and the injection of Trochilus payloads into memory. However, the question specifically asks about credential theft and accessing the domain controller, which are not part of the sequence described in the outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of Mimikatz or the copying of the NTDS.DIT database file.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question is not reflected in the attack sequence described in the outline.
- Given the lack of information in the outline about the specific TTPs mentioned in the question, it is not possible to conclude that APT10 would use Mimikatz and deploy Trochilus to copy the NTDS.DIT database file based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
