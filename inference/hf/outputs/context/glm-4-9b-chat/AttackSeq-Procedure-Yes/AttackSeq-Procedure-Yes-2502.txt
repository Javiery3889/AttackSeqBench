Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious Word, Excel, or PDF attachments are used to gain initial access. The emails often impersonate legitimate companies using typo-squatting domains.
- Execution: The malicious documents use template injection to execute macro code, which downloads and executes malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC.
- Credential Access: The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTA). They also sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks infected by the campaign.
- Others: The campaign has been active since at least 2015, and the malware includes modules that capture credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites after leveraging spear-phishing emails and executing RAT malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign includes a module called ScreenBooking, which captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. This suggests that the attackers have the capability to collect credit card information from OTA websites.
- The question's context is directly related to the Credential Access phase of the attack, where the outline mentions that attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the malware used in the campaign is designed to capture credit card data, and it specifically targets OTA websites like booking.com.
- Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that after gaining initial access and executing RAT malware, the attackers are likely to collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
