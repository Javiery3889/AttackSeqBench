1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The attack chain began with the opening of a malicious document via phishing email, which contained a custom backdoor (Pterodo).
     2. Execution: Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files, created scheduled tasks, and installed a VNC client as the ultimate payload.
     3. Persistence: Shuckworm created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
     4. Defense Evasion: Shuckworm used mshta.exe, scheduled tasks, and VBS scripts to evade detection.
     5. Collection: Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers.
     2. Downloading additional payloads.
     3. Using these payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers, but it does describe the use of a custom backdoor (Pterodo) and the execution of various scripts and files, which could imply the potential for downloading additional payloads.
   - The outline does mention that Shuckworm has been using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks, which suggests a level of sophistication that could include the download and execution of additional payloads for maintaining control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that Shuckworm is capable of executing various scripts and files, which could be part of a process to download additional payloads.
   - Step 2: The use of living-off-the-land tools and the sophistication of the attack suggest that Shuckworm may indeed download additional payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - Step 3: The question asks if Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads before using them to maintain control, which aligns with the behavior of advanced threat actors like Shuckworm.

Final Answer: A: Yes
