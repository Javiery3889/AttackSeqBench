Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Discovery: The malware searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives, including non-English filenames with certain keywords.
- Command and Control: Communication with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and use of FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
- Exfiltration: Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a clipboard stealer. However, it does describe the discovery phase where CosmicDuke searches for specific files on drives, which could include documents that might contain sensitive information copied to the clipboard.
- The exfiltration phase is mentioned to involve uploading collected information to remote servers via FTP, but there is no mention of a clipboard stealer being used as part of this process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about CosmicDuke using a clipboard stealer. The focus is on the methods used for initial access, persistence, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration, but not on the specifics of data collection methods such as clipboard stealing.
- Since there is no evidence in the CTI outline to support the use of a clipboard stealer, we cannot conclude that it is a part of CosmicDuke's TTPs.

Final Answer: B: No
