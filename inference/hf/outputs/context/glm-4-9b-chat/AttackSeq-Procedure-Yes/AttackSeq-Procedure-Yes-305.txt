1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The attackers used a Russian-language phishing campaign targeting Russian banks.
     - Delivery: The campaign involved emails with malicious attachments.
     - Execution: The attachments exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter (CVE-2017-0262).
     - Lateral Movement: Not explicitly mentioned, but the campaign likely involved lateral movement within the targeted network.
     - Persistence: Not explicitly mentioned, but the campaign likely established persistence on the compromised systems.
     - Credential Access: Not explicitly mentioned, but the campaign likely aimed to access credentials.
     - Discovery: The campaign was brought to the attention of the Central Bank of Russia's FinCERT by targeted banks.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter.
     - Using malicious docx files containing obfuscated code.
     - Establishing communication with a compromised server for command and control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline states that the attackers used emails with malicious attachments that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter. This matches the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The outline also mentions that the exploit was delivered via docx files containing an embedded EPS image file with obfuscated code, which matches the second TTP.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the communication with a compromised server for command and control. However, it is implied that the campaign was sophisticated enough to establish such communication, as it was brought to the attention of FinCERT, suggesting that the attackers had some level of control over the compromised systems.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms the use of a vulnerability in Microsoft's EPS filter, which is the first TTP in the question.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline confirms the use of docx files with obfuscated code, which is the second TTP in the question.
   - Step 3: Although the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the communication with a compromised server, it is reasonable to infer that such communication was part of the attack based on the overall sophistication of the campaign.

Final Answer: A: Yes
