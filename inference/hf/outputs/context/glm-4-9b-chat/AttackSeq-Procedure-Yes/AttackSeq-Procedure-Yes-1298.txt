Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
- Execution: User Execution (T1204)
- Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), Credentials in Registry (T1214)
- Collection: Data from Local System (T1005)
- Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043), Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
- Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)
- Others: Attack attributed to SWEED, malware hashes, dropping URL, Microsoft Office exploit, LokiBot

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, stealing stored passwords and access tokens using Credential Dumping and Credentials in Registry, and then considering the use of T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the attack sequence starting with Initial Access through Exfiltration, with no mention of T1107 (File Deletion) being used as part of defense evasion.
- The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing credentials.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of T1107 (File Deletion) in this attack sequence.
- Since there is no evidence in the outline that T1107 is used, we cannot conclude that it is a part of the campaign's tactics.
- Therefore, based on the information provided, the most plausible answer is that the campaign will not employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

Final Answer: B: No
