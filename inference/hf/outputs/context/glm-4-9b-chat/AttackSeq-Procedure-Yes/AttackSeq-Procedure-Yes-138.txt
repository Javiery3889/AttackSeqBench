Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The APT-TOCS attack used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
- Execution: The attack downloaded Shellcode script functionalities, executed them in memory, and communicated via Beacon mode.
- Defense Evasion: The attack ran in memory, did not write to the hard disk, and used multi-beacon communication.
- Lateral Movement: The attack moved laterally within the internal network.
- Others: The attack is related to Cobalt Strike, can penetrate firewalls, and is undetectable.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that APT-TOCS will use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control (C2) tactic stage.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that APT-TOCS uses PowerShell for initial access and execution, which suggests a familiarity with PowerShell for its operations.
- The outline also mentions that the attack communicates via Beacon mode, which is a form of C2 communication.
- The use of PowerShell for downloading encrypted data scripts is consistent with the outlined tactics, as PowerShell can be used to download and execute scripts.
- The communication via HTTP GET requests is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a common method for C2 communication and aligns with the outlined use of Beacon mode.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The APT-TOCS attack has been shown to use PowerShell for initial access and execution, which supports the use of PowerShell for downloading encrypted data scripts.
- The attack's use of Beacon mode for communication suggests a form of C2, which could involve HTTP GET requests.
- While the CTI outline does not explicitly state that APT-TOCS uses HTTP GET requests, it is a plausible method given the context of the attack's communication tactics.

Final Answer: A: Yes
