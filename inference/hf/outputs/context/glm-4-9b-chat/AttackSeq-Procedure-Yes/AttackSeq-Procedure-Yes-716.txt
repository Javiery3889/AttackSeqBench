Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by fetching various system information.
  2. Initial Access: The attack begins with malicious documents containing a macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader.
  3. Execution: The downloader retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
  4. Persistence: Rising Sun ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  5. Discovery: The implant fetches system information from the registry.
  6. Exfiltration: The implant encrypts and exfiltrates data to a control server via HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Initial reconnaissance by fetching system information.
  2. Communication with control servers for command and control purposes using HTTP POST requests.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that the Rising Sun implant is capable of exfiltrating data using HTTP POST requests, which aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the specific control servers (34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php) that the implant is likely to communicate with. However, it does state that the implant exfiltrates data to a control server via HTTP POST requests, which is consistent with the TTP in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Rising Sun implant is known to exfiltrate data using HTTP POST requests, which is a method that could be used for command and control communication.
- The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the control servers mentioned in the question, but it does not contradict the possibility of the implant using HTTP POST requests for such communication.
- Given the information provided, it is plausible that the Rising Sun implant could communicate with the specified control servers for command and control purposes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
