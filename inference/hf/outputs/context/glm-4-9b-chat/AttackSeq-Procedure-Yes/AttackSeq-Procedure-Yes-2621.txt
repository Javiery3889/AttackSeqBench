1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spearphishing
     2. Execution: Use of a downloader to install backdoor components
     3. Persistence: Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks
     4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading
     5. Credential Access: Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating stored credentials
     6. Discovery: Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting devices, file listings, and enumerating running processes
     7. Collection: Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data
     8. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating collected files to remote servers with encryption and scheduled transfers

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Collection: Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, and staging them in a temporary folder
     2. Exfiltration: Communication with command and control servers

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with command and control servers. However, it does state that Machete automatically exfiltrates all collected files to remote servers, encrypts the data, and sets up scheduled transfers to the C&C server every 10 minutes.
   - The outline also mentions that data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C, which implies that there is a specific method of communication established for exfiltration.
   - The question asks if the malware will use standard FTP and HTTP ports before implementing fallback channels. The use of fallback channels suggests that the primary method may not be reliable or secure, which could lead to the use of standard ports as a more reliable option.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide direct information about the use of standard FTP and HTTP ports.
   - Step 2: However, the mention of exfiltration over the same channel used for C&C implies a specific method of communication is in place.
   - Step 3: The use of fallback channels suggests that the primary method may not be the most reliable or secure.
   - Step 4: Given that standard FTP and HTTP ports are widely used and generally reliable, it is plausible that Machete would use them before implementing fallback channels.

Final Answer: A: Yes
