Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Attackers use Telegram channels to distribute Raccoon stealer malware, bypassing blocking of active C&C servers.
- Execution: Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers, and scans for crypto wallets.
- Command and Control: Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram's legitimate features to avoid detection.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using the legitimate features of Telegram. This suggests that the Raccoon stealer is designed to use Telegram for its Command and Control phase.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the Raccoon stealer making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers. However, it does mention that the C&C servers were encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick', which implies that the communication with the C&C servers is indeed through Telegram.
- The question asks about Defense Evasion, which is a tactic that involves evading detection by security systems. Since the Raccoon stealer uses Telegram's legitimate features to communicate with C&C servers, it is plausible that it would use this method to evade detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Raccoon stealer uses Telegram for Command and Control, as stated in the CTI outline.
- The use of Telegram for Command and Control suggests that the Raccoon stealer would likely use Telegram's features to communicate with C&C servers.
- The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the Raccoon stealer receives encrypted addresses of C&C servers from a Telegram channel, but it does mention that the C&C servers are distributed through a Telegram channel.
- Given the context and the use of Telegram for Command and Control, it is reasonable to infer that the Raccoon stealer would make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: A: Yes
