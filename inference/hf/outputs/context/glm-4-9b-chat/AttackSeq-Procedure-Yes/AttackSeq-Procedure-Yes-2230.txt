1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Grabit malware is delivered via a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment containing a malicious macro named AutoOpen.
     2. Persistence: Grabit malware modifies common registry entries, such as startup configurations, without covering its tracks.
     3. Command and Control: Grabit's 'call home' functionality communicates over obvious channels without attempting to hide its activity.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Grabit malware establishes persistence by modifying common registry entries.
     2. The question asks if it is likely to include Keylogger functionality.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention Keylogger functionality. However, it does describe the behavior of the Grabit malware, which includes modifying registry entries for persistence and using various RATs like DarkComet, which are known to include keylogging capabilities.
   - The outline also mentions that the malware targeted files with extensions like .txt and .jpeg, which are common file types for storing keylogging data. Additionally, the malware's ability to steal usernames and passwords suggests that it may have keylogging functionality.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that Grabit malware is designed to persist on an infected system by modifying registry entries.
   - Step 2: The outline also suggests that the malware is capable of collecting sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.
   - Step 3: Given that the malware is designed to steal sensitive information and that keyloggers are a common tool for such data collection, it is reasonable to infer that the malware could include keylogger functionality.
   - Step 4: The absence of explicit mention of keylogging in the outline does not negate the likelihood of its presence, as malware often includes multiple functionalities to maximize its effectiveness.

Final Answer: A: Yes
