1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     2. Execution: VBS macro execution, calling a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
     3. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script operates in memory, using .Net Webclient class and DCOM object to avoid detection.
     4. Command and Control: PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers to download payloads.
     5. Impact: GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are downloaded and executed.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial access through phishing emails.
     2. Execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. This aligns with the first TTP mentioned in the question.
   - The outline also describes the execution of a VBS macro that retrieves and runs an encoded PowerShell script, which is the second TTP mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms the use of phishing emails as the initial access vector.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline also confirms that the phishing emails contain an embedded Microsoft Word document with a VBS macro.
   - Step 3: The VBS macro is executed as part of the attack sequence, which is consistent with the question's description of the TTPs.
   - Step 4: Since the attack sequence described in the CTI outline matches the sequence of TTPs in the question, it is reasonable to conclude that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

Final Answer: A: Yes
