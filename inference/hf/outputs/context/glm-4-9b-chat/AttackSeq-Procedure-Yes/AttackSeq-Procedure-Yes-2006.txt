1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
The attack sequence in the CTI outline, presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics, is as follows:
- Reconnaissance: Gathering publicly available information and conducting active discovery methods.
- Initial Access: Delivery of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) through a phishing campaign.
- Credential Access: Harvesting credentials and conducting network discovery.
- Discovery: Lateral movement and target identification on both corporate and ICS networks.
- Command and Control: Establishing a connection from the malicious implant to attacker-controlled Command-and-Control (C2) servers.
- Impact: Developing malicious computer code, delivering data destruction malware, scheduling UPS disruptions, tripping breakers, severing connections to field devices, initiating a DoS attack, disabling critical systems via UPS outage, and destroying critical system data.

2. Analyze the Question:
The question asks whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the establishment of communication with Command-and-Control servers after the installation of the malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3). This aligns with the "Command and Control" phase of the attack sequence described in the CTI outline.

The CTI outline states that "Malware establishes connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to attacker-controlled CC server" under the "Command and Control" step. This indicates that after the initial access and credential access phases, the malicious implant (BlackEnergy 3) is designed to communicate with the attacker's Command-and-Control server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
- Step 1: The CTI outline clearly describes the sequence of events leading up to the establishment of a Command-and-Control connection.
- Step 2: The question asks about the communication with Command-and-Control servers after the installation of BlackEnergy 3, which is a direct outcome of the "Command and Control" phase.
- Step 3: The CTI outline confirms that the malware does establish a connection to the attacker's C2 server as part of its execution routine.

Final Answer: A: Yes
