1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The Inception attackers send a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
     2. Execution: They deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
     3. Persistence: POWERSHOWER sets up persistence on the infected machine.
     4. Defense Evasion: The attackers use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
     5. Discovery: POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.
     6. Command and Control: POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server and enters a communications loop.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Conducting a reconnaissance spear phish.
     2. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word.
     3. Deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a two-stage spear phishing process, where the first stage is for reconnaissance and the second stage is to deliver a payload containing a remote template.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates before deploying the PowerShell backdoor.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that CVE-2017-11882 is used in the first stage of the spear phishing, but it does mention that the second spear phish contains a remote template to deliver a payload.
   - The outline also states that the PowerShell backdoor, POWERSHOWER, is deployed in the execution phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the reconnaissance spear phish is used to gather information.
   - Step 2: The second stage of the spear phishing is to deliver a payload, which could include the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates.
   - Step 3: The PowerShell backdoor, POWERSHOWER, is deployed after the payload delivery.
   - Step 4: Since the second spear phish contains a remote template, it is plausible that CVE-2017-11882 is exploited before the deployment of the backdoor.

Final Answer: A: Yes
