Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
- Persistence: The infected device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing.
- Discovery: Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected.
- Lateral Movement: The internal security team verified with Darktrace that no lateral movement or data exfiltration had occurred.
- Command and Control: Darktrace detected APT35's C2 activity without relying on signatures or threat intelligence.
- Others: Max Heinemeyer, Director of Threat Hunting at Darktrace, authored a blog post detailing the discovery of APT35's activity, highlighting the value of self-learning AI.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected, which is a part of the Command and Control phase.
- The question is asking if the automation of the investigation process by Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst followed the detection of Command and Control activity.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline directly states that the Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device after the C2 was detected, which is a Command and Control activity.
- This indicates that the investigation process was automated by Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst following the detection of Command and Control activity.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is aligned with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
