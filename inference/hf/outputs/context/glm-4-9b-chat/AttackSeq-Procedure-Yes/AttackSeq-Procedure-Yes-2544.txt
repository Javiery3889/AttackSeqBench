1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers, deployed a backdoor, and used a stolen digital certificate.
     2. Initial Access: Exploited Log4Shell to spawn PowerShell processes, download and execute scripts, and install a malicious DLL.
     3. Execution: Execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
     4. Persistence: Milestone backdoor copies itself and creates a service in the registry for persistence.
     5. Privilege Escalation: Milestone backdoor creates a new administrator user, executes itself with elevated privileges, and removes the user.
     6. Defense Evasion: Use of Fire Chili rootkit and stolen certificates to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
     7. Discovery: Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system, file, and directory discovery, and screen capture.
     8. Command and Control: Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server and supports a command to send session information.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery: The Milestone backdoor discovers system information and captures the screen.
     2. Command and Control: The Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Milestone backdoor has the capability to communicate with a C2 server, which is part of the Command and Control phase.
   - The question asks if the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.
   - Given that the backdoor is designed to communicate with a C2 server and has the capability to send information about current sessions, it is plausible that it could be used to exfiltrate data.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Milestone backdoor is capable of discovering system information and capturing the screen.
   - Step 2: The backdoor communicates with a C2 server, which is a common method for exfiltrating data.
   - Step 3: The backdoor's command set includes a feature to send session information to the C2 server.
   - Step 4: Since the backdoor is designed to communicate with the C2 server and has the capability to send session information, it is reasonable to assume that it could be used to exfiltrate data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
