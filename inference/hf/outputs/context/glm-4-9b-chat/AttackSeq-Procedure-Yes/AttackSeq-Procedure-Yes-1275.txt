1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: Yellow Garuda uses spoofing and Android malware.
     2. Initial Access: Uses macro-enabled template files for initial access.
     3. Persistence: Macro-enabled template files replace the default Microsoft Word template.
     4. Defense Evasion: Uses RC4-encrypted strings and remote infrastructure for decryption keys.
     5. Credential Access: Uses phishing and a Telegram 'grabber' tool for credential harvesting.
     6. Collection: Collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from Telegram accounts.
     7. Others: OPSEC mistakes have led to the disclosure of tools and procedures.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Yellow Garuda collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts using the Telegram 'grabber' tool.
     2. The data are exfiltrated over the web.
     3. The data are stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline states that Yellow Garuda's Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.
   - The outline also mentions that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format.
   - The question asks if it is likely that these data are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that Yellow Garuda collects data from Telegram accounts using the 'grabber' tool.
   - Step 2: The CTI outline also confirms that the collected data are stored in a SQLite database and JSON format.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the method of exfiltration, but given that the data are stored in a structured format like JSON, it is reasonable to infer that the data were exfiltrated in a manner that supports such formats, which is typically over the web.
   - Step 4: The answer choices provided are "Yes" and "No."

Final Answer: A: Yes
