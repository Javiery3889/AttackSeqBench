Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
- Execution: Scripting (Batch, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments.
- Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros in documents.
- Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modifying registry keys, code signing, deobfuscation, remote templates, C# compiler module.
- Discovery: Backdoors list interesting files for exfiltration.
- Lateral Movement: Malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for sending emails.
- Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
- Exfiltration: Modules upload harvested documents to C&C server.
- Others: Targeting Ukrainian institutions, rapid execution, frequent domain changes, use of simple tools, persistence techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, followed by deployment of scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that after lateral movement, the Gamaredon group's backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration. This suggests that the group has a method for identifying and collecting sensitive documents.
- The question asks if it is likely that the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents. The outline does not explicitly mention the use of scripts for scanning, but it does mention that the backdoors list interesting files, which implies a method of identifying such files.
- The Gamaredon group is known for its rapid execution and adaptation, which could include the use of scripts for scanning as part of their collection activities.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Gamaredon group's behavior of listing interesting files suggests a method for identifying sensitive documents.
- The group's rapid execution and adaptation strategies may involve the use of scripts for scanning as part of their collection activities.
- While the CTI outline does not directly state that scripts are used for scanning, the context and behavior of the group imply that such a technique is plausible.

Final Answer: A: Yes
