Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager (CVE-2014-4114) being leveraged through infected Excel documents.
- Execution: The malware is executed through a Visual Basic macro in an Excel document, which then drops and executes additional executables.
- Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by registering itself to the startup shell.
- Defense Evasion: The malware uses various anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
- Discovery: The malware gathers network information for lateral movement.
- Lateral Movement: The malware is designed for lateral movement and sends data to servers across Europe.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with its C2 server using HTTP and sends localization and keyboard layout information.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the malware will function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process after communicating with the C2 server.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that FONTCACHE.DAT operates as a network sniffer and is dropped and executed by the malware. This suggests that the malware has the capability to perform network sniffing.
- The outline also states that the malware sends localization data and keyboard layout information to the C2 server, which indicates that it can communicate with the C2 server for data exfiltration purposes.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The malware is designed to perform network sniffing (as indicated by the FONTCACHE.DAT component).
- The malware has the capability to communicate with the C2 server (as indicated by the HTTP communication for localization and keyboard layout information).
- Given these capabilities, it is plausible that the malware could use the network sniffer to gather information and send it to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

Final Answer: A: Yes
