1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline is as follows:
     1. Execution: The technique is revealed and described.
     2. Exploitation: Threat actors exploit atom tables to inject malicious code.
     3. Manipulation: Threat actors manipulate legitimate programs to execute the malicious code.
     4. Bypassing Security: The technique is capable of bypassing antivirus, NGAV, and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Executing malicious code by exploiting atom tables.
     2. Bypassing process-level restrictions.
     3. Evading security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a technique that can bypass security solutions, which includes antivirus, NGAV, and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions. This suggests that the technique is designed to evade security measures.
   - The question asks if threat actors will use the capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.
   - Given that the technique is capable of bypassing security solutions, it is reasonable to infer that it could also be used to bypass process-level restrictions and inject code into trusted processes.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that AtomBombing can bypass security solutions, which implies it has the capability to evade security measures.
   - Step 2: The question asks if threat actors would use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and inject code into trusted processes.
   - Step 3: Since the technique is designed to bypass security solutions, it is plausible that it could also be used to bypass process-level restrictions and inject code into trusted processes.
   - Final Answer: A: Yes
