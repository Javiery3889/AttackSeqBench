1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the outline is as follows:
     1. The Elderwood Project attackers establish command and control (C&C) servers.
     2. These servers are used to retrieve commands from the attackers and maintain control over the victim's computer.
     3. The Elderwood Project is known for using zero-day exploits and has been linked to the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009.
     4. The group has developed an attack platform, termed the 'Elderwood platform,' which allows them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits.
     5. The group's systematic approach and reuse of components suggest a high level of technical capability.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
     2. Establishing command and control (C&C) servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the Elderwood Project attackers establish C&C servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will establish C&C servers after deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention watering hole attacks, but it does state that the attackers have established C&C servers and use zero-day exploits, which are consistent with the question's scenario.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms that the Elderwood Project attackers use C&C servers for command and control.
   - Step 2: The outline also confirms the use of zero-day exploits, which are a common method for initial access.
   - Step 3: The question's scenario aligns with the outlined TTPs, as the attackers are known to establish C&C servers after gaining initial access.
   - Step 4: The context provided in the "Others" section suggests a systematic approach by the attackers, which would include the establishment of C&C servers after initial access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
