1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) on the PCA website.
     2. Execution: Deployed Rdws.exe, a dropper executable, which used DLL sideloading to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) and a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
     3. Defense Evasion: Used sideloading to evade defenses, connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain of the attackers' infrastructure.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL.
     2. Establishing evasion.
     3. Connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL and to connect back to the exploit domain and a subdomain of their infrastructure.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication.
   - Given the information in the CTI outline, the malware did indeed connect back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, which suggests that it is likely that the malware would connect back to the specific domain mentioned in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline confirms the use of sideloading techniques for deploying a malicious DLL.
   - Step 2: The same technique was used for connecting back to the attackers' infrastructure.
   - Step 3: The specific domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org is mentioned as part of the attackers' infrastructure.
   - Step 4: Since the malware is known to connect back to the attackers' infrastructure, it is reasonable to conclude that it would connect back to the specific domain provided.

Final Answer: A: Yes
