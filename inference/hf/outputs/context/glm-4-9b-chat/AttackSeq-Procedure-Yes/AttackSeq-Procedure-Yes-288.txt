Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server upon opening. Subsequent spear-phishing emails with an MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or a PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352. Watering hole attacks with a website that requires downloading a PowerPoint document to view the entire article, which contains a malicious artifact.
- Execution: UPX packed backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
- Defense Evasion: Backdoor uses encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to evade detection.
- Credential Access: Backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials among other data.
- Collection: File-stealer module collects specific files and uploads them to the C2 server.
- Command and Control: Backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, and resilient communications are used to hide C2 server locations.
- Others: Kaspersky Lab detects Dropping Elephant artifacts and collaborates with CERTs and LEAs.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it is likely that Dropping Elephant will use spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents to gain initial access before executing UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing emails with malicious documents as part of the Initial Access phase. This aligns with the first part of the question.
- The outline also mentions that the backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, which corresponds to the second part of the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline provides evidence that Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing emails with malicious documents for initial access.
- The outline also indicates that the group uses UPX-packed backdoors to download additional malware.
- Both of these actions are mentioned in the question as part of the attack sequence.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is consistent with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
