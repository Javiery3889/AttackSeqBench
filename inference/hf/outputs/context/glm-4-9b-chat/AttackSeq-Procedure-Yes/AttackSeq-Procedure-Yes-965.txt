Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a weaponized RTF file that drops a loader, followed by downloading and executing a payload from a C&C server.
- Execution: The Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
- Persistence: Persistence is achieved through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key and by injecting into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
- Defense Evasion: The group uses limited daily windows for C&C server operations, fileless loading, and changes server infrastructure and loader variants.
- Discovery: The Aria-body backdoor gathers information from the victim's machine.
- Collection: The backdoor has capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location.
- Others: The group targets government entities in the Asia Pacific region, uses servers within infected entities as C&C servers, and has specific infrastructure for domain registration and hosting.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication after the Aria-body backdoor collects information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the protocols used for C&C communication. However, it does mention that the Aria-body loader contacts C&C servers, which implies that there is some form of communication established.
- The group's defense evasion tactics include operating C&C servers within limited daily windows and frequently changing server infrastructure, which suggests that they may use protocols that are less likely to be detected or monitored.
- HTTP and TCP are common protocols for C&C communication, but given the group's sophisticated tactics, they might opt for less common or obfuscated protocols to avoid detection.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the protocols used for C&C communication.
- Given the group's sophisticated tactics and the lack of explicit information about the protocols, it is not possible to definitively conclude that they will use HTTP and TCP.
- However, it is also not out of the realm of possibility, as these are common protocols for such communication.

Final Answer: B: No
