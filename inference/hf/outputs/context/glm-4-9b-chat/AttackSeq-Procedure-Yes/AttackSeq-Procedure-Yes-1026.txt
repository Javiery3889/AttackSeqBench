1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
     2. Execution: Scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments.
     3. Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros in documents.
     4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry key modifications, code signing, deobfuscation, decryption, remote templates, C# compiler module.
     5. Discovery: Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
     6. Lateral Movement: Malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for sending emails.
     7. Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
     8. Exfiltration: Modules upload harvested documents to C&C server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
     2. Using a backdoor to list interesting files (Office documents) during discovery.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.
   - The CTI outline mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration. This suggests that the malware is capable of identifying and collecting specific types of files.
   - The outline does not explicitly state that the malware scans all drives, including network shared drives, but it does indicate that the group is interested in Office documents and has the capability to list them for exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence that the malware scans all drives, including network shared drives, but it does show that the group is interested in Office documents and has the capability to list them.
   - Given that the group is focused on exfiltrating data and has shown a pattern of targeting sensitive information, it is plausible that they would extend their search to include all drives and network shared drives to maximize data collection.
   - Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the context suggests that the malware may indeed scan all drives for sensitive data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
