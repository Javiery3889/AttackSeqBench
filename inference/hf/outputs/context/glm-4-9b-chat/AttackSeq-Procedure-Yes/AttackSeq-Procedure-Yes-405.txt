1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Spear phishing attack using a malicious Excel file.
     2. Execution: Enabling Macro content in the Excel file to execute a PE file.
     3. Defense Evasion: Employing obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from debuggers and sandbox software.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Establish communication with an IP address.
     2. Use an expired digital certificate.
     3. Send HTTP communication to perform Command and Control operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the malware establishing communication with an IP address, using an expired digital certificate, or sending HTTP communication for Command and Control operations. However, it does mention that the malware employs obfuscation and defense evasion techniques, which could be part of a broader strategy to avoid detection and communication with a Command and Control server.
   - The question asks if the malware is "likely" to perform these actions. Given the context of the outline, we can infer that the malware is designed to be stealthy and evade detection, which might include establishing communication with a Command and Control server, but there is no direct evidence of an expired digital certificate or HTTP communication being used.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the malware is sophisticated and designed to evade detection, which suggests it may have the capability to establish communication with a Command and Control server.
   - Step 2: There is no mention of an expired digital certificate in the CTI outline, so we cannot confirm this aspect of the TTPs.
   - Step 3: The outline does not specify the use of HTTP communication for Command and Control operations, but it does not contradict the possibility either.
   - Step 4: Since the question asks if the malware is "likely" to perform these actions, and we know it is designed to evade detection, it is plausible that it could establish communication with an IP address for Command and Control operations.

Final Answer: A: Yes
