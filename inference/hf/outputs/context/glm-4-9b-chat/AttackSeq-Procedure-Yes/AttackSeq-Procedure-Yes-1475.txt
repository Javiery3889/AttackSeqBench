Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Attackers compromise a website and redirect visitors to infecting code, exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
- Execution: Malware downloads a DLL, runs in PowerShell, checks for antivirus software, and exits if found. It also uses CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
- Persistence: SLUB backdoor copies itself and creates a Run registry key with a typo to achieve persistence.
- Privilege Escalation: Downloader uses CVE-2015-1701 to acquire Local Privilege Escalation.
- Defense Evasion: Downloader exits if antivirus software is detected.
- Discovery: SLUB backdoor downloads a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parses it for commands.
- Collection: Backdoor collects information, takes screenshots, lists files, copies files, uploads files, and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: Backdoor communicates with attackers via Slack using hardcoded tokens and the Slack API.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if it's likely that the attackers will exfiltrate data by creating archive files of user's Desktop folders and building CAB files before posting download links to the Slack channel.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the SLUB backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. It also collects information from registry keys and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
- The outline does not explicitly mention the creation of CAB files or posting download links to the Slack channel. However, it does state that the backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SLUB backdoor is capable of creating archives of user's Desktop folders, which is a form of data collection and exfiltration.
- The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, which is a method of command and control.
- While the outline does not mention the creation of CAB files or posting download links, it does not contradict the possibility of the attackers using the Slack channel for such actions.
- Given the capabilities of the backdoor and the communication channel, it is plausible that the attackers could use the Slack channel to post download links after creating archives of Desktop folders.

Final Answer: A: Yes
