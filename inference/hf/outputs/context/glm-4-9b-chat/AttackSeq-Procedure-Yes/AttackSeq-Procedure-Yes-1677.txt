Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used SocGholish to compromise websites and deliver a malicious JavaScript.
  2. Initial Access: The malicious JavaScript led to the execution of additional scripts and the deployment of Cobalt Strike.
  3. Execution: Cobalt Strike was used to download and execute a .NET injector and the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
  4. Privilege Escalation: The attackers used slui.exe and wmic.exe for privilege escalation.
  5. Defense Evasion: PsExec was used to disable Windows Defender and stop services.
  6. Credential Access: Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and log file clearing.
  7. Discovery: Commands and PowerView were used to profile the computer and search the Active Directory.
  8. Lateral Movement: Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for lateral movement.
  9. Command and Control: The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Defense Evasion: Using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender.
  2. Impact: Ransomware deployment leading to encryption and ransom demand.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline describes the use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender as part of the Defense Evasion phase. This action is intended to create a conducive environment for the ransomware to operate without interference from security measures.
- The question asks if it is likely that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom in the Impact phase.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Defense Evasion phase actions are designed to ensure that the ransomware can operate without detection or interference.
- The ransomware, WastedLocker, is specifically mentioned in the CTI outline as the target of the attack.
- Given that the ransomware is the intended payload and the actions taken in the Defense Evasion phase are consistent with the deployment of ransomware, it is reasonable to conclude that the ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a ransom.
- Therefore, the answer to the question is likely to be "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
