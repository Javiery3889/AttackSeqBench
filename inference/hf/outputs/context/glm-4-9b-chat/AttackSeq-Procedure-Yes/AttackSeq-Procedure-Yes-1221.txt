1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Deployment of Citrix and LogMeIn using stolen credentials.
     2. Execution: Deployment of Trochilus malware and UPPERCUT backdoor.
     3. Privilege Escalation: DLL sideloading for malware delivery.
     4. Defense Evasion: DLL sideloading to inject Trochilus payload into memory.
     5. Credential Access: Use of Mimikatz for credential theft and access to domain controller.
     6. Lateral Movement: Regular logins via Citrix servers using valid accounts.
     7. Collection: Compression of proprietary data using WinRAR and exfiltration to Dropbox using cURL for Windows.
     8. Command and Control: Encrypted C2 communications using RC4 and Salsa20 ciphers.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Collection: Compressing proprietary data using WinRAR.
     2. Exfiltration: Using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employing cURL for Windows to upload the files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the attackers used WinRAR to compress data and cURL for Windows to exfiltrate the data to Dropbox during the Collection phase.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows during the Exfiltration phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline clearly states that the attackers used cURL for Windows to exfiltrate the compressed data to Dropbox, which aligns with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Step 2: The use of cURL for Windows is not specified as custom malware in the CTI outline; however, it is a command-line tool that can be used for various purposes, including exfiltration.
   - Step 3: The question asks if custom malware is used, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the outline does not contradict the use of custom malware for exfiltration.
   - Step 4: Given that the CTI outline does not provide information about the use of custom malware but does confirm the use of cURL for Windows, it is plausible that the attackers could use custom malware for exfiltration, especially considering the sophistication of the attack and the use of other custom tools like Trochilus and UPPERCUT.

Final Answer: A: Yes
