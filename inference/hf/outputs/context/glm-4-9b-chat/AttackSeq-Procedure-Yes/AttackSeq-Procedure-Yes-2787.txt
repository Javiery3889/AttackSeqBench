1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, with the icon hidden on iOS 7 and not hidden on iOS 8.
     - Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Collecting information (text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, etc.).
     - Sending the gathered information via HTTP.
     - Uploading files via FTP protocol as part of Command and Control operations.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the method of exfiltration (i.e., how the collected information is sent to the attacker). However, it does not contradict the possibility of using HTTP for sending information or FTP for uploading files.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the app sends the information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP. This is a speculative question based on the provided information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide specific details on the exfiltration method used by the malware.
   - Step 2: The question is asking about the likelihood of using HTTP for exfiltration followed by FTP for file upload.
   - Step 3: Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about the exfiltration method, we cannot definitively say that the malware uses HTTP for exfiltration or FTP for file upload.
   - Step 4: However, given that the question is asking about the likelihood, and considering that HTTP and FTP are common protocols for exfiltration and file transfer, respectively, it is plausible that the malware could use these protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
