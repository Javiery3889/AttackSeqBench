Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: FIN13 has exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK, to establish a foothold.
- Execution: FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
- Persistence: FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords, and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
- Privilege Escalation: FIN13 utilizes common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks.
- Defense Evasion: FIN13 employs defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion.
- Credential Access: FIN13 uses techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
- Discovery: FIN13 leverages native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
- Lateral Movement: The group uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally, employing utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.
- Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
- Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
- Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data for fraudulent transactions.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance (Discovery phase). This is a clear indication that they are gathering information about the victim network.
- The question specifically mentions the Reconnaissance phase, which is the phase where an attacker gathers information about the target network.
- The outline also states that FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase, which is a subsequent step after Reconnaissance.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mandiant would track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase, as this is a typical behavior for an attacker before moving on to more advanced stages like Execution.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: FIN13 is known to gather information about the victim network during the Discovery phase.
- Step 2: The question asks if Mandiant would track FIN13 for this behavior.
- Step 3: Based on the CTI outline, FIN13's behavior aligns with the Reconnaissance phase.
- Step 4: Therefore, it is likely that Mandiant would track FIN13 for gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
