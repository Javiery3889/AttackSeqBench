1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, replacing the legitimate netd and inheriting root privileges.
     2. Persistence: Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd to persist on the system.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel executes shell scripts as the root user.
     4. Defense Evasion: The malware ensures it is run as intended by checking execution context.
     5. Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes credentials and deploys tcpdump for network traffic monitoring.
     6. Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates directories, collects GPS, lists installed packages, gathers system information, and performs IP scanning.
     7. Command and Control: The malware provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for SSH connections.
     8. Exfiltration: Infamous Chisel's netd component exfiltrates files using Tor and SSH connections.
     9. Impact: The legitimate netd is replaced, potentially impacting the service.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates directories and gathers system information.
     2. Collection: The question asks if the component will automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that during the Discovery phase, Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates directories and gathers system information, which includes collecting GPS information, listing installed packages, and gathering various system information such as the Android ID and other hardware information.
   - The outline does not explicitly mention the collection of files based on a predefined list of file extensions. However, it does state that the netd component is responsible for exfiltrating files at regular intervals using Tor and SSH connections.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Discovery phase involves gathering information about the system, including directories and system information.
   - Step 2: The Exfiltration phase is where files are exfiltrated, which could imply that the malware has identified files of interest during the Discovery phase.
   - Step 3: The question asks if the collection of files is automatic based on a predefined list of file extensions. While the outline does not explicitly state that this is the case, it does suggest that the malware has the capability to identify and exfiltrate files.
   - Step 4: Given that the malware is designed to exfiltrate files and that the Discovery phase involves gathering system information, it is plausible that the malware could automatically collect files based on a predefined list of file extensions.

Final Answer: A: Yes
