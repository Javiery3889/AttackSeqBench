Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The StellarParticle campaign gained access via SSH using stolen local accounts and established RDP sessions using different domain accounts. They also used VPNs and exported saved passwords from Chrome browsers.
- Defense Evasion: They used stolen browser cookies to bypass MFA and renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate binaries, as well as renamed their systems to match the victim's.
- Credential Access: They stole web session cookies, used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP, and compromised service principals for changes in the Office 365 environment.
- Discovery: They used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory and probed external services.
- Lateral Movement: They used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
- Collection: They accessed data from Information Repositories.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Defense Evasion
3. Credential Access
4. Discovery
5. Lateral Movement
6. Collection

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks if the StellarParticle campaign is likely to use credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights for persistence before evading defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights for persistence
2. Evading defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention credential hopping or Delegated Administrator rights. However, it does mention the use of stolen web session cookies to bypass MFA, which aligns with the second part of the question's sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide information on credential hopping or the use of Delegated Administrator rights for persistence.
- The CTI outline does confirm the use of stolen browser cookies to bypass MFA, which is the second TTP mentioned in the question.

Given that the CTI outline does not provide evidence for the first TTP (credential hopping and Delegated Administrator rights for persistence), we cannot conclude that the StellarParticle campaign is likely to use these techniques based on the provided information.

Final Answer: B: No
