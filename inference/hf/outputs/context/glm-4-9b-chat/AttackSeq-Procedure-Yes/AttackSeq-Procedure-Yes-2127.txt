Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Konni APT Group delivers an ISO file with a zip file containing malicious scripts.
- Execution: VBScripts and batch files are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', and 'resolvedns.bat'.
- Persistence: 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.
- Discovery: 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.
- Collection: 'versioninfo.bat' collects information for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with a C2 server.
- Exfiltration: 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrate data.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including XOR, after 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' and before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of XOR obfuscation or any other specific obfuscation technique. However, it does mention that the scripts are malicious and that the Konni APT Group is known for using spear-phishing emails and malicious documents, which often involve obfuscation to evade detection.
- The sequence of events after 'stopedge.bat' scheduling 'install.vbs' is not directly related to the obfuscation of scripts. The focus is on persistence and the execution of 'install.vbs'.
- The 'versioninfo.bat' script is responsible for discovering system details, which is a step that comes after the persistence mechanism is in place.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline does not provide specific details about the use of XOR or other obfuscation techniques in the scripts.
- However, given that the Konni APT Group is known for using sophisticated methods to evade detection, it is plausible that they would use obfuscation techniques such as XOR to make their scripts harder to detect.
- The question is about the likelihood of using obfuscation before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details, which is a step that occurs after the persistence mechanism is established.

Final Answer: A: Yes
