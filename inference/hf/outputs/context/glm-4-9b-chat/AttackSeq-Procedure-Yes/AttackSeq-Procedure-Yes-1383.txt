1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: The use of masscan to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
     2. Reconnaissance: The use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations.
     3. Reconnaissance: The discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication, which could be exploited for further reconnaissance.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Identifying potential entry points into medical infrastructure using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys.
     2. Discovering various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes a reconnaissance phase where cybercriminals use masscan, Shodan, and Censys to identify potential entry points, which includes discovering non-trivial ports and services.
   - The question asks if it is likely that various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, will be discovered as part of network service discovery.
   - Given the information in the CTI outline, the reconnaissance phase explicitly mentions the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, which would include outdated systems and medical devices.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline indicates that the reconnaissance phase includes the use of tools to identify potential entry points.
   - Step 2: The same outline states that non-trivial ports and services, such as outdated systems and medical devices, are discovered during this phase.
   - Step 3: The question asks if it is likely that these services will be discovered as part of network service discovery, which is a direct outcome of the reconnaissance phase described in the outline.
   - Step 4: Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the discovery of various services, including outdated systems and medical devices, is a plausible outcome of the reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
