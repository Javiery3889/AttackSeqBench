Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
- Execution: Scripting (Batch, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, user execution of malicious email attachments.
- Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, malicious macros in documents.
- Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, modifying registry keys, code signing, deobfuscation, remote templates.
- Discovery: Backdoors list interesting files for future exfiltration.
- Lateral Movement: Malicious macros in Word and Excel documents, Outlook VBA macro for spreading within the organization.
- Command and Control: HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
- Exfiltration: Modules upload harvested documents to C&C server.
- Others: Targeting Ukrainian institutions, rapid execution, frequent domain changes, persistence techniques.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is: injecting malicious macros into all accessible Word and Excel documents for lateral movement via compromised systems, followed by the collection phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline indicates that after lateral movement, the Gamaredon group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, for future exfiltration. This suggests that during the collection phase, the malware would indeed search for sensitive documents.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, which aligns with the concept of searching for sensitive documents during the collection phase.
- The TTPs mentioned in the question are consistent with the lateral movement phase of the attack, which is followed by the collection phase.
- Given that the backdoors are designed to list interesting files, it is reasonable to conclude that the malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
