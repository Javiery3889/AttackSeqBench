Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Resource Development
  3. Initial Access
  4. Execution
  5. Persistence
  6. Privilege Escalation
  7. Defense Evasion
  8. Credential Access
  9. Lateral Movement
  10. Collection
  11. Command and Control
  12. Exfiltration
  13. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. T1553 Subvert Trust Controls
  2. T1057 Process Discovery
  3. T1071 Application Layer Protocol

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions T1553 Subvert Trust Controls as a Defense Evasion technique used by the threat actors. This suggests that the actors had already evaded defenses.
- The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors employed T1057 Process Discovery before leveraging T1071 Application Layer Protocol for command and control.
- T1057 Process Discovery is a Lateral Movement technique that can be used to enumerate processes running on a system, which can provide knowledge about the systems and internal networks.
- T1071 Application Layer Protocol is a Command and Control technique used to communicate with compromised systems.

Given the sequence of TTPs in the outline, the actors had already evaded defenses (T1553) and were likely to move laterally within the network (T1057) before establishing command and control (T1071). The outline does not explicitly state that T1057 was used before T1071, but it does imply a progression from evading defenses to lateral movement to command and control.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The actors used T1553 to evade defenses, which is a step that would logically precede lateral movement (T1057).
- Lateral movement (T1057) is a step that would precede command and control (T1071) as it is necessary to understand the internal network before establishing communication with it.
- Therefore, it is plausible that the actors used T1057 Process Discovery before leveraging T1071 Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: A: Yes
