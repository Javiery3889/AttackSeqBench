Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers compromised a website and redirected visitors to the infecting code, exploiting CVE-2018-8174.
- Execution: The malware executes a multi-stage infection process, exploiting CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation, and downloads a backdoor named SLUB.
- Persistence: The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to ProgramData\update\ and creating a Run registry key with a typo.
- Privilege Escalation: The downloader exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
- Defense Evasion: The downloader exits if it detects antivirus software processes.
- Collection: The backdoor supports various commands for data collection.
- Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.
- Exfiltration: The attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and sharing links via Slack.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if the SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the SLUB backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. It also collects information from registry keys.
- The question specifically asks about retrieving the username and computer name, which are types of information that could be collected as part of discovery tactics.
- The outline does not explicitly state that the backdoor retrieves the username and computer name, but it does mention that it collects information from registry keys, which could include such information.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The SLUB backdoor is capable of collecting information from registry keys, which could include the username and computer name.
- The question asks if the backdoor is likely to retrieve this information as part of its discovery tactics before exfiltration.
- Given that the backdoor is designed to collect a variety of information, it is plausible that it would retrieve the username and computer name to better understand the environment it is operating in.

Final Answer: A: Yes
