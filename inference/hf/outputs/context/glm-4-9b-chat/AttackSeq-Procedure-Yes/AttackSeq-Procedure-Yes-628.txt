Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: The attack starts with the delivery of malware via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'.
  2. Execution: The HTA file drops and opens a decoy Microsoft Word DOC file while executing a backdoor in the background.
  3. Persistence: The malware installer utilizes embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection.
  4. Lateral Movement: The malware executes by deleting the original file and rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
  5. Evasion: The self-copied file is polymorphic, with each execution resulting in a different MD5 hash.
  6. Command and Control: The malware uses domains with a history of phishing and malware distribution for command and control.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The malware rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
  2. Employing evasion techniques and using obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that the malware installer utilizes embedded VB Script to extract and execute the payload, employing techniques to minimize visibility and avoid detection. This aligns with the second TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline also states that the self-copied file is polymorphic, which is an evasion technique. This supports the first TTP mentioned in the question.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly indicates that the malware is designed to minimize visibility and avoid detection, which is consistent with the TTPs listed in the question.
- The malware's behavior of rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension is a form of obfuscation, which is an evasion technique.
- Therefore, based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is highly likely that the malware will employ evasion techniques and use obfuscation to minimize visibility and avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
