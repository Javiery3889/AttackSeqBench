Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with social engineering and document-based exploits, using a PDF file with a malicious Flash object to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Execution: The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples, with an update in mid-April 2014.
- Persistence: The malware creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence on the system.
- Credential Access: CosmicDuke targets various software to steal credentials and uses a password to encrypt exported data.
- Discovery: The malware searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
- Collection: CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, and searches removable drives for files.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltration.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload the collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials during the Exfiltration phase.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline states that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data. This suggests that it is capable of using FTP for data exfiltration.
- The outline does not explicitly mention that CosmicDuke uses stored login credentials for FTP, but it does mention that it uses credentials for other purposes, such as encrypting exported data.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke is designed to exfiltrate data, which aligns with the question's focus on the Exfiltration phase.
- While the outline does not explicitly state that CosmicDuke uses stored login credentials for FTP, it is plausible that if it uses credentials for other purposes, it might also use them for exfiltration.
- Given the capabilities of CosmicDuke to communicate with remote servers and use FTP for exfiltration, it is reasonable to infer that it could automatically upload collected information using FTP with stored credentials.

Final Answer: A: Yes
