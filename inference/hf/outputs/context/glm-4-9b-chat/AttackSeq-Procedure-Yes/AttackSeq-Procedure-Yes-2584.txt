1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The attack begins with the alteration of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website to download malicious JavaScript files.
     2. Execution: The malware, gpsvc.exe, is downloaded and executed on visitors' devices.
     3. Defense Evasion: The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for packing and executes system information gathering commands.
     4. Discovery: The malware gathers system information and sends it back to the C&C server, eye-watch[.]in.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. The malware gathers system information (hostname, user details, active TCP connections).
     2. The malware communicates with the identified C&C servers.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the malware sends gathered system information back to the C&C server, eye-watch[.]in. However, it does not specify the method of communication used by the malware with the C&C server.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers at IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218 using application layer protocols.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the communication protocol used by the malware to communicate with the C&C servers.
   - Step 2: Since the communication protocol is not specified, we cannot definitively conclude that the malware uses application layer protocols.
   - Step 3: However, it is common for malware to communicate with C&C servers using application layer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or other custom protocols.
   - Step 4: Given the commonality of using application layer protocols for C&C communication, it is plausible that the malware in question uses such protocols.

Final Answer: A: Yes
