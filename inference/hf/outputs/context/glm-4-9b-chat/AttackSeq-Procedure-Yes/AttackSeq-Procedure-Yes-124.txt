1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection) leads to uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
   - Execution: Deployment of custom malware ('IPsec Helper' .NET backdoor) for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
   - Persistence: Deployment of webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Use of webshells with obfuscation and 'IPsec Helper' with trace deletion capabilities.
   - Lateral Movement: Use of webshells for RDP tunneling and compromised accounts for lateral movement, along with offensive security tools for credential harvesting.
   - Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP for commands and actions.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks if it is likely that Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' (which later became ransomware) to destroy data on targeted systems after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of wipers or ransomware like 'Apostle'. However, it does describe the capabilities of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which includes updating its configuration and self-deletion, suggesting a level of flexibility and adaptability in the malware's functionality.
   - The question implies a potential escalation in the attack, moving from data exfiltration and lateral movement to data destruction. While the outline does not provide direct evidence of such an escalation, it does show that the threat actor is capable of deploying and updating malware, which could include destructive actions.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The CTI outline details the capabilities of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, which includes updating its configuration and self-deletion.
   - Step 2: The question asks about the likelihood of Agrius deploying wipers like 'Apostle' after using the backdoor for other actions.
   - Step 3: While the outline does not explicitly state that wipers or ransomware were deployed, the backdoor's capabilities suggest that such an action is within the realm of possibility.
   - Step 4: Given the flexibility of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and the nature of cyber attacks, it is plausible that Agrius could have used it to deploy wipers or ransomware.

Final Answer: A: Yes
