Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
- Execution: Upon successful execution on the victim machine, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
- Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature.
- Command and Control: RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Defense Evasion
4. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question is specifically asking about the Initial Access phase of the attack, which is the first step in the attack sequence.
- The CTI outline states that RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, which includes redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.

Given this information, the answer to the question is directly supported by the CTI outline.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline clearly states that RIG EK uses malvertising to deliver exploits, which includes redirecting users to advertising pages.
- The question asks if RIG EK is likely to use this method before redirecting users to its landing page, and since the outline specifies that this is how RIG EK delivers exploits, it is reasonable to conclude that this is the method used.
- Therefore, the answer choice that aligns with the attack sequence and the details provided in the CTI outline is "Yes."

Final Answer: A: Yes
