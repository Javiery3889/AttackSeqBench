Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter masqueraded as legitimate job recruitment activity to gather information.
  2. Initial Access: Malicious documents were distributed via Dropbox and an IP address in the United States, containing a macro that injected the Sharpshooter downloader.
  3. Execution: The macro executed shellcode in winword.exe, which downloaded the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
  4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  5. Command and Control: The Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
  6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypted and exfiltrated data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
  2. Performing initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info and IP address information.
  3. Communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the Rising Sun implant performing initial reconnaissance after ensuring persistence. However, it does describe the implant's capabilities, which include executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. This suggests that the implant is capable of reconnaissance activities.
- The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to perform initial reconnaissance before communicating with control servers. Given its capabilities, it is plausible that the implant could perform reconnaissance activities as part of its discovery process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The Rising Sun implant has the capability to gather information, which includes network adapter info and IP address information.
- The implant's persistence mechanism is established before it communicates with control servers.
- It is common for malware to perform reconnaissance activities before establishing communication with its command and control infrastructure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
