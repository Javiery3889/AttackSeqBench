1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Email with a PDF attachment (executable file) sent to Susan.
     2. Execution: Executable file creates a folder, extracts files, runs scripts, and uses encryption tool.
     3. Persistence: Modifies Windows registry, uses legitimate applications to collect credentials, and configures applications to run batch files.
     4. Defense Evasion: Uses legitimate tools and scripts without malicious activity.
     5. Collection: Collects credentials recurrently every hour.
     6. Command and Control: Uses FTP command to upload stolen credentials.
     7. Exfiltration: Stolen credentials exfiltrated to an FTP server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour.
     2. Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.
     3. Uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the attack used legitimate applications to collect credentials, which matches the second TTP in the question.
   - The outline also mentions that the attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials, which aligns with the third TTP in the question.
   - The first TTP in the question, persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour, is also mentioned in the outline under the Persistence section.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence described in the CTI outline includes all three TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - The use of legitimate applications to collect credentials is explicitly stated in the outline.
   - The outline also indicates that the attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials, which is consistent with the third TTP.
   - The persistence mechanism, as described, is in line with the first TTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
