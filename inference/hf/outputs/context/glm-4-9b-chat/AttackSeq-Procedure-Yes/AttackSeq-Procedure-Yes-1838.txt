Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Execution: The BlackEnergy malware is activated.
  2. The malware assesses if the infected computer is the intended target.
  3. If the computer is the intended target, a regular BlackEnergy variant is deployed.
  4. The malware stores XML configuration data within the DLL payload, which includes a list of C&C servers and a unique build_id.
  5. The malware communicates with C&C servers.
  6. The KillDisk component is used to overwrite data and sabotage processes on industrial control systems.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. The BlackEnergy malware is activated and assesses the target.
  2. A regular BlackEnergy variant is deployed with XML configuration data.
  3. The malware communicates with C&C servers.
  4. The KillDisk component is used to overwrite data and sabotage processes.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will communicate with C&C servers before using the KillDisk component.
- Based on the CTI outline, the malware does communicate with C&C servers as part of its deployment process (step 5). This communication is necessary for the malware to receive instructions and configuration data, including the unique build_id and list of C&C servers (step 4).
- The KillDisk component is used after the malware has been deployed and has established communication with the C&C servers (step 6).

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- Step 1: The malware is activated and assesses the target.
- Step 2: A regular BlackEnergy variant is deployed with XML configuration data.
- Step 3: The malware communicates with C&C servers to receive instructions and configuration data.
- Step 4: The KillDisk component is used to overwrite data and sabotage processes.
- Final Answer: A: Yes
