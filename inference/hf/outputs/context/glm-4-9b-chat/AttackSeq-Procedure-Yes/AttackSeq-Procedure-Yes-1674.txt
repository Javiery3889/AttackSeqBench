Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance: The attackers used SocGholish framework on compromised websites.
  2. Initial Access: The SocGholish framework delivered a zipped file with malicious JavaScript.
  3. Execution: Execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer, and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
  4. Privilege Escalation: Use of slui.exe and wmic.exe for privilege escalation.
  5. Defense Evasion: Use of PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
  6. Credential Access: Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and log file emptying.
  7. Lateral Movement: Cobalt Strike Beacon for executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
  8. Command and Control: Communication with a C&C domain using the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
  9. Impact: Deployment of WastedLocker ransomware to encrypt computers and servers.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Use of the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.
  2. Use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline clearly states that the initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites, which matches the first TTP mentioned in the question.
- The outline does not mention the use of the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView. However, it does mention the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, which could imply the use of commands for remote system discovery, but it does not specifically mention PowerView or the Get-NetComputer command.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The first TTP mentioned in the question is confirmed by the CTI outline.
- The second TTP is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement suggests that the attackers may have used commands for remote system discovery, though it does not specifically name PowerView or the Get-NetComputer command.
- Given that the second TTP is not explicitly confirmed by the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely the attackers will use the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView.

Final Answer: B: No
