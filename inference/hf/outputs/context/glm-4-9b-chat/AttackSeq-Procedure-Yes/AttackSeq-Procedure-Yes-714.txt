1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: Operation Sharpshooter gathers information through job recruitment activity.
     2. Initial Access: Malicious documents are distributed, containing a macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
     3. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
     4. Discovery: The Rising Sun implant performs reconnaissance by fetching system information.
     5. Command and Control: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypts and exfiltrates data to the control server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Initial Access: The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word.
     2. Subsequent Activity: The Rising Sun implant downloading a second-stage payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline clearly states that the Sharpshooter downloader is the initial access vector, and it retrieves the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server. This indicates that after initial access is achieved, the Rising Sun implant is indeed downloaded as a second-stage payload.
   - Answer Choice A: Yes, aligns with the information provided in the CTI outline, as it states that the Rising Sun implant is downloaded as a second-stage payload after the Sharpshooter downloader is executed.
   - Answer Choice B: No, does not align with the information provided in the CTI outline, as it contradicts the fact that the Rising Sun implant is downloaded as a second-stage payload.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the initial access vector as the Sharpshooter downloader.
   - Step 2: Note that the Sharpshooter downloader retrieves the Rising Sun implant as a second-stage payload.
   - Step 3: Confirm that the Rising Sun implant is intended to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.
   - Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the outlined sequence of events.

Final Answer: A: Yes
