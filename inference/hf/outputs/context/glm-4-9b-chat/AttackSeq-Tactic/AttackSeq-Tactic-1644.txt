1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Collection
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After developing resources such as phishing portals mimicking the Government of India's webmail
     - Before deploying a variety of RATs and post-infection plugins

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred between developing resources and deploying RATs and plugins.
   - The development of resources such as phishing portals is part of the "Resource Development" phase.
   - Deploying RATs and plugins is part of the "Execution" phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The development of resources like phishing portals is a step in the "Resource Development" phase, which is typically followed by the "Execution" phase.
   - The "Execution" phase involves deploying the developed resources and malware, which includes the deployment of RATs and plugins.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be that the "Execution" tactic occurred after the "Resource Development" tactic.

Final Answer: B: Execution
