Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Phishing email, SharePoint URL, ZIP file with VBS script, JavaScript backdoor.
- Execution: JavaScript backdoor, CARBANAK RAT installation, obfuscated script, DLL file execution, PowerShell RAT installation.
- Privilege Escalation: Active Directory escalation, RunPsExec, PowerShell RAT.
- Discovery: Cobalt Strike deployment, reconnaissance and data discovery.
- Command and Control: CARBANAK RAT beaconing, PowerShell RAT communication.
- Exfiltration: SmartFTP Client, data exfiltration.
- Impact: RYUK ransomware deployment, data exfiltration.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Privilege Escalation
4. Discovery
5. Command and Control
6. Exfiltration
7. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks for the ATT&CK tactic that occurred after the attacker deployed Cobalt Strike on the network and performed reconnaissance using a different infrastructure and before exfiltrating data using the SmartFTP Client.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
- Deployed Cobalt Strike
- Performed reconnaissance
- Exfiltrated data

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs from the question aligns with the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
- Deployed Cobalt Strike: This corresponds to the "Discovery" phase in the CTI outline.
- Performed reconnaissance: This also corresponds to the "Discovery" phase.
- Exfiltrated data: This corresponds to the "Exfiltration" phase in the CTI outline.

Given this alignment, we need to determine which ATT&CK tactic fits between "Discovery" and "Exfiltration."

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The sequence of events after "Discovery" and before "Exfiltration" in the CTI outline is the "Command and Control" phase, where the CARBANAK RAT and PowerShell RAT communicate with their respective Command-and-Control servers. This phase is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it is the most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred after reconnaissance and before exfiltration.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
