Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with the delivery of a malicious Word document that contains a macro. The macro is used to drop the BlackEnergy Trojan if the user enables it.
- Execution: The macro builds a string in memory containing "vba_macro.exe" and executes it using the Shell command, leading to the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper.
- Command and Control: The BlackEnergy Trojan connects to a hardcoded C&C server to receive commands and send victim information.
- Impact: The BlackEnergy APT group is known for destructive actions and espionage activities.
- Others: Additional information about the trojans and countermeasures is provided.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Command and Control
4. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely ensured that the BlackEnergy dropper would be executed on every system startup after the execution of "vba_macro.exe."

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Execution of "vba_macro.exe"
2. Ensuring the BlackEnergy dropper is executed on every system startup

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention a tactic that ensures the dropper is executed on every system startup. However, the information provided in the "Execution" section indicates that the dropper ensures persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.

Based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the tactic that aligns with ensuring persistence on system startup is:
- Persistence: This tactic involves actions that allow a threat actor to maintain access to a system over time.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The initial access is achieved through a malicious document and macro, which is consistent with the Initial Access tactic.
- The execution of "vba_macro.exe" is part of the Execution tactic.
- The persistence mechanism, which involves placing a LNK file in the startup folder, is a characteristic of the Persistence tactic.
- The Command and Control aspect is related to the communication with the C&C server, which is not directly related to ensuring the dropper runs on startup.

Final Answer: D: Persistence
