1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: Tickusb malware is executed as a DLL file and creates a log file to check for USB flash drive connections.
     - Defense Evasion: The malware avoids automatic execution upon system booting and only runs when certain files are executed, and it alters normal programs to load malicious DLLs.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After Tickusb infected systems via USB flash drives
     - Before it evaded detection by altering normal programs and avoiding automatic execution upon system boot

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence from the CTI outline suggests that the malware's initial infection vector is via USB flash drives, which is a method of Initial Access.
   - The malware's execution as a DLL file and its ability to check for USB flash drive connections are part of the Execution tactic.
   - The defense evasion tactics, such as avoiding automatic execution upon system boot and altering normal programs, come after the initial infection and execution.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the CTI outline starts with the malware being executed via USB flash drives, which is an Initial Access tactic.
   - The Execution tactic is the immediate action taken by the malware after it is executed.
   - The Defense Evasion tactics come after the initial infection and execution, as they describe how the malware evades detection.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the initial infection via USB flash drives but before evading detection is the Execution tactic.

Final Answer: C: Execution
