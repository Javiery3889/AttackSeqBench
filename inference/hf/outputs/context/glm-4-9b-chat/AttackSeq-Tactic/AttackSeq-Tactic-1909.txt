1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The attackers gain access to the online stores of large US retailers, likely through spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords.
     - Command and Control: The attackers inject malicious scripts into the store checkout pages to intercept transactions and send the intercepted data to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After intercepting customer keystrokes and sending transaction data to a controlled collection server, the next step is funneling stolen assets through a global exfiltration network using hijacked legitimate sites.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The extracted attack sequence from the CTI outline matches the details in the question, as the last step described is the attackers sending the intercepted data to a controlled collection server.
   - The question asks for the next step in the sequence, which is funneling stolen assets through a global exfiltration network. This aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of "Exfiltration."

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The initial access is achieved through spearphishing, which is not the next step in the sequence we are analyzing.
   - Step 2: The command and control phase involves injecting malicious scripts and intercepting transactions, which is also not the next step.
   - Step 3: The CTI outline states that the intercepted data is sent to a controlled collection server, which is the last action described in the outline.
   - Step 4: The question asks for the next step after sending the data to the collection server, which is funneling stolen assets through a global exfiltration network.
   - Step 5: The MITRE ATT&CK tactic that corresponds to funneling stolen assets through a network is "Exfiltration."

Final Answer: A: Exfiltration
