1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: The malware executes by deleting the original file and rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder with a randomized Hex-filename and '.tmp' extension.
     2. Defense Evasion: The malware employs evasion techniques such as minimizing the script window and avoiding the display of the window taskbar. It also uses obfuscation to hide the writing of binary codes as HEX to form files, and it checks for the existence of files before deletion to ensure persistence.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After the attackers gained access by delivering malware via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta'
     - Before the malware executed a polymorphic self-copied file from the %Temp% folder with a randomized name

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of events in the question starts with the delivery of the malware, which is a part of the Initial Access tactic. The malware is delivered via a file named 'Thu moi.7z' containing 'Thumoi.hta', which suggests that the attackers have already gained access to the system.
   - The question asks for the TTP that occurred after Initial Access and before the malware executes the polymorphic self-copied file. The Execution tactic is the one that involves the malware's actual execution, which includes the self-copied file to the %Temp% folder.
   - The Defense Evasion tactic is part of the malware's behavior after execution but is not the immediate step before the execution of the polymorphic file.
   - The Collection tactic is not mentioned in the outline and is not relevant to the sequence of events described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events starts with Initial Access, as the malware is delivered and executed.
   - The next step in the sequence is Execution, as the malware then performs actions such as deleting the original file and rewriting itself to the %Temp% folder.
   - Defense Evasion is a behavior that occurs after the malware has executed, but it is not the immediate step before the execution of the polymorphic file.
   - Collection is not mentioned in the outline and is not relevant to the sequence of events described in the question.

Final Answer: B: Initial Access
