1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: WinDealer executes by locating an embedded DLL file in its resources, decoding it, and then has various capabilities.
     - Persistence: WinDealer maintains persistence through the registry's RUN key.
     - Discovery: WinDealer targets specific applications and registry keys, indicating a focus on Chinese-speaking targets.
     - Command and Control: WinDealer uses a complex IP generation algorithm and hardcoded URLs for communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely involved delivering the malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications before WinDealer's persistence was achieved through the registry's RUN key.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is related to the delivery of the malware.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The delivery of malware via the automatic update mechanism of legitimate applications is a method of initial delivery, which would fall under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic of Initial Access.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: Collection - This tactic is more about gathering information rather than delivering malware.
     - B: Execution - This tactic is about executing the malware, not delivering it.
     - C: Reconnaissance - This tactic is about gathering intelligence, not delivering malware.
     - D: Initial Access - This tactic involves the initial delivery of malware to a target system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The delivery of malware via an automatic update mechanism is a method of gaining initial access to a system, as it involves the initial introduction of the malware into the environment.
   - The other answer choices (Collection, Execution, Reconnaissance) do not align with the initial delivery of malware.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs that involves delivering the malware before achieving persistence is Initial Access.

Final Answer: D: Initial Access
