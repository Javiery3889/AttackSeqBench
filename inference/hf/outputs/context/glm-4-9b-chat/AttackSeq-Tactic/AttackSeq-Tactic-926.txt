1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: The PowerShell script loads a DLL into memory.
     - Persistence: The VBScript is placed in the Startup folder for persistence.
     - Defense Evasion: The PowerShell script includes an AMSI bypass method.
     - Command and Control: The final PowerShell script leads to njRAT, establishing C2.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the loading of a DLL into memory from an obfuscated and Base64 encoded string, which is part of the Execution tactic.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the execution of the PowerShell script.
   - The sequence in the CTI outline shows that the Execution tactic is the second stage, which means that the tactic before Execution is not explicitly listed in the outline.
   - However, based on the typical attack lifecycle and the sequence of events in the outline, the most plausible tactic that occurred before Execution is Initial Access, as it is the first stage in the outline and typically involves the initial entry into the victim's system.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline starts with the Initial Access tactic, which is the entry point for the attack.
   - The Execution tactic follows, which is the second stage and involves the PowerShell script.
   - Since the question asks for the tactic that occurred before Execution, and there is no other tactic listed before Execution in the outline, we can infer that the Initial Access tactic is the most likely one to have occurred before the PowerShell script execution.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is Initial Access.

Final Answer: C: Initial Access
