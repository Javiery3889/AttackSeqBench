1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The outline describes an attack involving iOS malware that is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows systems.
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Discovery: The app is designed to collect various types of information from the iOS device.
     - Command and Control: The malware communicates with a C&C server using HTTP requests and can also upload files via FTP.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the iOS malware was installed but before it started gathering information.
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the sequence of tactics that would follow Initial Access.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The sequence of TTPs from the CTI outline is Initial Access, Discovery, and Command and Control.
   - The question is asking for the tactic that comes after Initial Access but before Discovery.
   - Based on the sequence, the tactic that fits this description is Command and Control, as it is the next step after the malware is installed and before it starts to gather information.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The malware is installed on already compromised systems (Initial Access).
   - Step 2: The malware establishes communication with a C&C server (Command and Control).
   - Step 3: The malware starts to gather information from the iOS device (Discovery).
   - The sequence of tactics after Initial Access but before Discovery is Command and Control.

Final Answer: C: Command and Control
