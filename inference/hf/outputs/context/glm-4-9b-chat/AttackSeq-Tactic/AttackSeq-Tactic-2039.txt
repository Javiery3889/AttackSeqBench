1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Initial Access
     4. Execution
     5. Persistence
     6. Discovery
     7. Lateral Movement
     8. Impact

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After executing backdoor malware embedded within trusted software on victims' machines
     - Before gathering information and credentials on Windows systems

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence from the CTI outline shows that after the Execution phase (4), the next phase is Discovery (6).
   - The question asks for the tactic that most likely occurred between the Execution of backdoor malware and the Discovery of information and credentials on Windows systems.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: Command and Control - This is typically the phase where attackers establish communication with their command and control servers, which is not directly related to the sequence described in the question.
     B: Defense Evasion - This tactic is used to avoid detection, but it does not specifically address the sequence of actions described.
     C: Discovery - This is the phase where attackers gather information and credentials, which is the next step after executing the backdoor malware as described in the question.
     D: Resource Development - This phase is about creating or gaining user accounts, which is not the immediate sequence after executing the malware.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of events described in the question follows the Execution phase (4) and precedes the Discovery phase (6) in the CTI outline.
   - The most plausible tactic that occurred between these two phases is Discovery (6), as it is the next logical step in the attack sequence where attackers would gather information and credentials.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is C: Discovery.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
