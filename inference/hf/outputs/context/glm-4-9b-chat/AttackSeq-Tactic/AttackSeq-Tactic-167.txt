1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: The Lazarus group installed backdoors on several machines belonging to financial institutions.
     - Defense Evasion: The backdoors employed complex techniques to evade detection, including the use of a loader DLL, an encrypted backdoor, and an encrypted configuration file.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After using encrypted backdoors in memory and configuring the loader DLLs to evade detection, the next step is to connect to specific servers for task management.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the connection to specific servers for task management. However, the question asks about the next step in the sequence after the backdoors are in place and configured.
   - The answer choices provided are:
     A: Initial Access
     B: Reconnaissance
     C: Defense Evasion
     D: Command and Control

   - Given the context of the question, the next logical step after evading detection and having the backdoors in place would be to establish a connection to a command and control (C2) server for further instructions and task management.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The Lazarus group has successfully installed backdoors on the target machines.
   - Step 2: The backdoors are configured to evade detection using sophisticated techniques.
   - Step 3: The next step in the sequence would be to establish a connection to a C2 server for task management, as this is the typical next step after initial access and configuration.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
