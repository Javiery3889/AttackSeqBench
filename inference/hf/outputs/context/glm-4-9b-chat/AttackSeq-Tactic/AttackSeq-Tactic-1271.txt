1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Discovery
     8. Lateral Movement
     9. Command and Control

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - TG1021 actively interfered with logging mechanisms to evade detection
     - TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit for target mapping and reconnaissance

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline indicates that TG1021's actions to interfere with logging mechanisms and evade detection are part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - The question asks for the TTP that occurred after Defense Evasion and before Discovery.
   - Based on the attack sequence, the TTP that follows Defense Evasion is Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the TTPs in the question: Interfering with logging mechanisms (Defense Evasion) and using offensive security tools (Discovery).
   - Step 2: Determine the sequence of these TTPs in the attack outline: Defense Evasion comes before Discovery.
   - Step 3: Identify the TTP that follows Defense Evasion in the attack outline: Discovery.
   - Step 4: Match the TTP from the question to the TTP from the attack outline.

Final Answer: C: Discovery
