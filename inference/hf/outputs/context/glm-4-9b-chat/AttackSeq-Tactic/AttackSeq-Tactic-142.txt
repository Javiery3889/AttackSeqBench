1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation (not detailed)
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - SparrowDoor probed files in specified directories (Discovery phase)
     - Communicating with the C&C server over HTTPS (Command and Control)

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks for the TTP that occurred after Discovery and before Command and Control.
   - Based on the attack sequence from the CTI outline, the TTPs that follow Discovery and precede Command and Control are:
     - Defense Evasion
     - Credential Access

   - Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
     A: Execution - This occurred before Discovery, so it is not the correct answer.
     B: Command and Control - This is the activity that follows Discovery, but the question asks for the TTP that occurred before Command and Control.
     C: Collection - This is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a plausible step that could occur after Discovery and before Command and Control, as it involves gathering information that could be used for further actions.
     D: Resource Development - This occurred before Initial Access and is not relevant to the sequence after Discovery.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence shows that after Discovery, the next steps are Defense Evasion and Credential Access.
   - The question asks for the TTP that occurred after Discovery but before Command and Control.
   - While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention "Collection," it is a plausible step that could occur after Discovery and before Command and Control, as it involves collecting information that could be used for further actions.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the information provided is Discovery, followed by Collection, and then Command and Control.

Final Answer: C: Collection
