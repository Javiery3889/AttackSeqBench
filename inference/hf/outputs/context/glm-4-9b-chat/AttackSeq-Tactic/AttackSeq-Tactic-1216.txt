Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Privilege Escalation
  5. Defense Evasion
  6. Credential Access
  7. Discovery
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is after the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands, and injecting processes on remote computers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs in the question corresponds to the "Lateral Movement" tactic, which is the last tactic mentioned in the CTI outline before "Impact."
- The question asks for the next most likely ATT&CK tactic after lateral movement. Based on the outline, the next step in the sequence is "Impact," as it is the final tactic listed.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline lists the attack sequence, and the sequence of TTPs in the question is after lateral movement.
- The outline clearly shows that after lateral movement, the next step is the "Impact" tactic.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement is "Impact."

Final Answer: C: Impact
