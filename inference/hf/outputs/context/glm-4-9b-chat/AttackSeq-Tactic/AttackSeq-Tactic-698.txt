Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign, distribution of Zebrocy components
- Execution: Taking screenshots, gathering system information, network scanning, executing system commands
- Persistence: COM object hijacking for persistence, custom backdoor installation
- Defense Evasion: Deleting files and killing processes
- Credential Access: Using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases
- Collection: Scanning for specific file extensions on local system, network shared drives, and removable media
- Command and Control: Communication with C&C server using ports 80 or 443, data exfiltration

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Credential Access
6. Collection
7. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the TTP that occurred between the Sednit group using dumpers to retrieve credential-related databases and scanning for specific file extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
- After Credential Access
- Before Collection

Based on the attack sequence from the CTI outline:
- Credential Access is the fifth step.
- Collection is the sixth step.

The TTP that occurred immediately after Credential Access and before Collection is Defense Evasion.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence shows that Credential Access is followed by Defense Evasion.
- The question asks for the TTP that occurred between Credential Access and Collection.
- Defense Evasion is the correct TTP in this sequence.

Final Answer: Defense Evasion
