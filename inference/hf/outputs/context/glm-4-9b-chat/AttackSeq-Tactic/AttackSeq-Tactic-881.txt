1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The use of Cobalt Strike's beacon for initial compromise and establishment of a foothold.
     2. Privilege Escalation: Attackers escalate privileges to obtain administrator credentials for lateral movement.
     3. Defense Evasion: Techniques to bypass detection by security products are used.
     4. Discovery: Use of tools like ADFind and port scanning to collect information about the network and connected PCs.
     5. Lateral Movement: Propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the propagation of beacons to other systems within the company's network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The extracted attack sequence from the CTI outline indicates that after Discovery (gathering network information), the next step is Lateral Movement (propagation of beacons to other systems).
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: Discovery - This is the step that has already occurred, as mentioned in the CTI outline.
     B: Execution - This is not the next step in the sequence as per the outline; Execution would be part of the Initial Access phase.
     C: Defense Evasion - This is a technique used throughout the attack, but it is not the next step in the sequence after Discovery.
     D: Lateral Movement - This is the next step in the sequence as per the outline, where attackers propagate beacons to other systems within the company's network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence provided in the CTI outline clearly outlines the steps taken by the attackers, with Lateral Movement being the next step after Discovery.
   - The question asks for the next tactic after gathering network information, which is Lateral Movement.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: D: Lateral Movement
