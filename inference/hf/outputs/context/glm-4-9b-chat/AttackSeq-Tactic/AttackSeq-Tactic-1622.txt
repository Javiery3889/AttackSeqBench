1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Collection
     10. Command and Control
     11. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Discovery (using HUC Port Banner Scanner and nbtscan)
     - Exploiting remote services
     - Using internal spear phishing to transfer tools and establish network tunnels

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred next after the Discovery phase. The sequence of events described in the question suggests that the threat actor has already gathered information about the network (Discovery) and is now taking action to transfer tools and establish network tunnels (exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing).
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: Reconnaissance - This phase is about gathering information, which has already been completed (as indicated by the use of discovery tools).
     B: Defense Evasion - This phase is about evading detection, which could be part of the process but is not the immediate next step after discovery.
     C: Lateral Movement - This phase involves moving laterally within the network to access other systems. It is a plausible next step after discovery, as the threat actor would need to move around the network to transfer tools and establish tunnels.
     D: Discovery - This phase has already occurred, as indicated by the use of discovery tools.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The immediate next step after Discovery, as described in the question, involves the threat actor taking action to transfer tools and establish network tunnels. This aligns with the Lateral Movement phase, which is about moving within the network to access other systems.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after Discovery is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: C: Lateral Movement
