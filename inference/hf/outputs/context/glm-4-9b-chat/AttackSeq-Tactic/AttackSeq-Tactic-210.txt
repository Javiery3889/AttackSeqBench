Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server upon opening. A subsequent spear-phishing email with an MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or a PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352 is sent. They also use watering hole attacks with a website that downloads a PowerPoint document to view the entire article, which contains a malicious artifact.
- Execution: The backdoor used by Dropping Elephant is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
- Defense Evasion: The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts, which are then executed to download additional malware. This method of using encoded blobs helps evade detection.
- Credential Access: The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials among other data.
- Collection: The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
- Command and Control: The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, which can be spotted by analyzing firewall log files. The group also uses resilient communications, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.
- Others: The Dropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products under various signatures. Kaspersky Lab collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and mitigate the threat. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) include a list of backdoors, exploit documents, domains, IPs, and C2 redirectors.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Defense Evasion
4. Credential Access
5. Collection
6. Command and Control

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before Dropping Elephant gained initial access to high-profile targets through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, with a focus on gathering information.

The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
- Initial Access

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question is asking for the ATT&CK tactic that would precede the Initial Access phase, which is the first step in the attack sequence. The other ATT&CK tactics listed (Execution, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Collection, Command and Control) are all subsequent steps in the attack process.

Given that the question is about the tactic that occurred before Initial Access, we can eliminate the following:
- A: Initial Access (This is the first step in the sequence, not the one that precedes it.)
- B: Impact (This is not a standard MITRE ATT&CK tactic.)
- C: Discovery (This is not a standard MITRE ATT&CK tactic.)
- D: Reconnaissance (This is a standard MITRE ATT&CK tactic that would occur before Initial Access, as it involves gathering information about the target.)

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence provided in the CTI outline starts with Initial Access, which is the step where Dropping Elephant gained access to the targets. Therefore, the tactic that would have occurred before this is Reconnaissance, as it involves gathering information about the target before attempting to gain access.
- Final Answer: D: Reconnaissance
