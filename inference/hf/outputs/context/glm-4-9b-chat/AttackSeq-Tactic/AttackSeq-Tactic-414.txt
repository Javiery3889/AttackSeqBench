1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Defense Evasion
     4. Discovery
     5. Lateral Movement
     6. Command and Control

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Evading detection by using a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader
     - Using the Dumpert tool
     - Lateral movement leveraging credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool as part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before the lateral movement, which is described as leveraging credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques.
   - The sequence of events in the outline suggests that after Defense Evasion, the actors performed Discovery, followed by Lateral Movement.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The actors evaded detection using a custom Mimikatz variant and the Dumpert tool, which is part of the Defense Evasion tactic.
   - Step 2: The next step in the outline is Discovery, where the actors ran commands to do initial discovery on the system and network.
   - Step 3: The final step before Lateral Movement is the Discovery phase, where the actors would have gathered information that could be used for lateral movement.
   - Step 4: The lateral movement is described as leveraging credentials obtained through memory dumping and pass-the-hash techniques, which is a form of Credential Access.

Final Answer: C: Credential Access
