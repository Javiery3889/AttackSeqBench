Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Resource Development
  3. Initial Access
  4. Execution
  5. Persistence
  6. Privilege Escalation
  7. Defense Evasion
  8. Discovery
  9. Lateral Movement
  10. Collection
  11. Command and Control
  12. Exfiltration
  13. Impact

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  - After Defense Evasion techniques like Indicator Removal on Host
  - Before Discovery techniques such as Process Discovery

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks for the TTP that occurred after Defense Evasion and before Discovery.
- Defense Evasion is listed as the 7th tactic in the sequence.
- Discovery is listed as the 8th tactic in the sequence.
- Therefore, the TTP that occurred immediately after Defense Evasion and before Discovery would be the 8th tactic in the sequence.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of tactics in the CTI outline is: Reconnaissance, Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, Impact.
- The question asks for the tactic that comes after Defense Evasion (7th) and before Discovery (8th).
- Based on the sequence, the tactic that fits this description is Lateral Movement, which is the 9th tactic in the sequence.

Final Answer: Lateral Movement
