1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access
     2. Execution
     3. Persistence
     4. Privilege Escalation
     5. Defense Evasion
     6. Credential Access
     7. Discovery
     8. Lateral Movement
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Moved laterally through the network to identify relevant data
     - Established command and control channels to maintain access

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after the threat actor moved laterally through the network to identify relevant data and established command and control channels to maintain access.
   - Based on the attack sequence from the CTI outline, after the lateral movement (step 8), the next phase is Command and Control (step 9).

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: The attack sequence starts with Initial Access, followed by Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, and Discovery.
   - Step 2: After Discovery, the attacker moves laterally through the network to identify relevant data, which is part of the Lateral Movement phase.
   - Step 3: Once the attacker has moved laterally and identified relevant data, the next logical step is to establish command and control channels to maintain access, which is the Command and Control phase.
   - Step 4: The Exfiltration phase comes after Command and Control, but the question asks for the tactic that occurs after lateral movement and establishing command and control channels.

Final Answer: D: Command and Control
