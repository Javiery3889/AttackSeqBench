Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign, distribution of Zebrocy components via shortened URLs, execution of a downloader, and decoy PDF.
- Execution: Operators took control, sent commands, downloaded and executed a new downloader, and installed a Delphi backdoor.
- Persistence: COM object hijacking for persistence, custom backdoor execution.
- Defense Evasion: Deleting files and killing processes to disable security tools.
- Credential Access: Using dumpers to target browsers and email clients, retrieving credentials.
- Discovery: Gathering information about the victim's computer and environment.
- Collection: Scanning for files, staging data, and capturing input and screen data.
- Exfiltration: Preparing data, sending to C&C server with encryption and hex-encoding.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Credential Access
6. Discovery
7. Collection
8. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the communication with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports. This is part of the Exfiltration phase of the attack.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: T1568-Dynamic Resolution - This technique is about modifying the resolution of a process at runtime, which is not directly related to establishing communication with a C&C server.
B: T1113-Screen Capture - This technique is about capturing the screen, which is part of the Collection phase and not related to communication setup.
C: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is about establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which is directly related to the exfiltration phase where data is sent to the C&C server.
D: T1547.012-Print Processors - This technique is about using print spoolers to execute code, which is not related to communication setup.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs that occurred before the downloaders and backdoors established communications with the C&C server using encrypted and hex-encoded data over commonly used ports is T1573-Encrypted Channel, as it directly relates to the communication aspect of the exfiltration phase.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
