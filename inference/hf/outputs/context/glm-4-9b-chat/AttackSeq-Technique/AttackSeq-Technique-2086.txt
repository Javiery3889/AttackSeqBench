1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
     2. Execution: Upon successful execution on the victim machine, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
     3. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.
     4. Command and Control: RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the technique that most likely occurred before RIG EK initiated its Initial Access through drive-by compromise leveraging malvertising and compromised sites.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question is asking for the technique that happened before the Initial Access phase. The Initial Access phase is described as RIG EK delivering exploits to victims through malvertising and compromised sites.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1587.002-Code Signing Certificates - This technique is related to the Defense Evasion phase, not the Initial Access phase.
     B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities - This technique is related to the Initial Access phase, as it involves obtaining the necessary capabilities to perform an attack.
     C: T1091-Replication Through Removable Media - This technique is not mentioned in the CTI outline and is not related to the Initial Access phase.
     D: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is related to the Command and Control phase, not the Initial Access phase.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Initial Access phase of the RIG EK attack involves delivering exploits to victims, which requires the attacker to have the necessary capabilities to perform the attack.
   - The TTP that aligns with this requirement is T1588-Obtain Capabilities, as it involves obtaining the necessary capabilities to perform an attack.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before RIG EK initiated its Initial Access is T1588-Obtain Capabilities.

Final Answer: B: T1588-Obtain Capabilities
