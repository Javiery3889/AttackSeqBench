1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The attackers used Telegram channels to distribute the Raccoon stealer malware.
     - Execution: The Raccoon stealer collects data from the system, accounts, bank card data, and crypto wallet details.
     - Command and Control: The Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram's legitimate features to avoid detection.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - After the Raccoon stealer was executed, it made network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted C&C server addresses.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs from the question are related to the Command and Control phase of the attack, specifically how the Raccoon stealer communicates with its C&C servers.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1566-Phishing - This technique is related to the Initial Access phase, not the Command and Control phase.
     B: T1027-Obfuscated Files or Information - This technique is related to the Execution phase, not the Command and Control phase.
     C: T1222.001-Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification - This technique is related to the Execution phase, not the Command and Control phase.
     D: T1010-Application Window Discovery - This technique is related to the Command and Control phase and involves discovering application windows, which could be a method used to bypass blocking mechanisms or to interact with the application in a way that allows for network requests.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline indicates that the Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers after executing, which is part of the Command and Control phase.
   - The TTP that aligns with the Command and Control phase and involves bypassing blocking mechanisms is T1010-Application Window Discovery.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the Raccoon stealer bypassed blocking by making network requests to a Telegram channel is T1010-Application Window Discovery.

Final Answer: D: T1010-Application Window Discovery
