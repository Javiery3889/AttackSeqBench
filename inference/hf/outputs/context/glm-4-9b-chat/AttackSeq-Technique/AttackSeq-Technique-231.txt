1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Execution: The Lazarus group installed backdoors on several machines.
     - Defense Evasion: The backdoors are sophisticated and difficult to detect, using a loader DLL, an encrypted backdoor, and an encrypted configuration file.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the technique used to establish secure communication with C2 servers after deploying backdoors as services and obfuscating their presence using encrypted configuration files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of encrypted configuration files, which suggests that the communication with C2 servers is likely encrypted.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple stages to deliver a payload, which is not directly related to establishing secure communication channels.
     - B: T1548.006-TCC Manipulation: This technique involves manipulating trusted communication channels, which is not directly related to the use of encrypted configuration files.
     - C: T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using encryption to secure communication channels, which aligns with the use of encrypted configuration files.
     - D: T1055-Process Injection: This technique involves injecting code into a process, which is not directly related to establishing secure communication channels.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline indicates that the backdoors use encrypted configuration files, which suggests that the communication with C2 servers is encrypted.
   - The answer choice that best aligns with the use of encryption for secure communication is T1573-Encrypted Channel.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs to establish secure communication with C2 servers is T1573-Encrypted Channel.

Final Answer: C: T1573-Encrypted Channel
