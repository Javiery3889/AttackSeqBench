1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Resource Development: RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
     2. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising and compromised websites.
     3. Execution: RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
     4. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising and redirecting users to exploit kit landing pages.
     2. RIG EK's infrastructure uses an API server through reverse proxy to Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS) for Command and Control.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence from the CTI outline aligns with the first part of the question. The second part of the question asks about the technique that most likely occurred before the use of an API server through reverse proxy to VDS for Command and Control.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1090-Proxy - This technique involves using a proxy to route network traffic, which could be related to the use of proxy servers in the defense evasion phase.
     B: T1574.008-Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking - This technique is about intercepting traffic by manipulating the search order of paths, which does not seem directly related to the described sequence.
     C: T1205-Traffic Signaling - This technique is about signaling traffic to a command and control server, which could be related to the use of an API server through reverse proxy to VDS for Command and Control.
     D: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique involves establishing an encrypted channel for communication, which could be related to the use of an API server through reverse proxy to VDS for Command and Control.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question suggests that the technique in question is related to the establishment of a command and control channel.
   - T1090-Proxy is related to the use of proxy servers, which is part of the defense evasion technique but not directly related to the command and control setup.
   - T1205-Traffic Signaling is the most directly related to the command and control aspect of the sequence, as it involves signaling traffic to a command and control server.
   - T1573-Encrypted Channel is also related to command and control but is more about the encryption of the channel rather than the signaling of traffic to the server.

Final Answer: C: T1205-Traffic Signaling
