1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
     2. Initial Access: TG1021 exploited Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
     3. Execution: TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
     4. Persistence: TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework for persistence.
     5. Privilege Escalation: TG1021 used PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
     6. Defense Evasion: TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
     7. Credential Access: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
     8. Discovery: TG1021 used offensive security tools to scan and map targets.
     9. Command and Control: TG1021 deployed an inline hook for C2 functionality.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Employing PowerSploit and SharpHound for reconnaissance.
     2. Leveraging compromised domain credentials to access shared folders over SMB.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks about TG1021's lateral movement between IIS servers on the victim's network after reconnaissance and credential access.
   - The answer choices are:
     A: T1087.004-Cloud Account
     B: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information
     C: T1021-Remote Services
     D: T1021.007-Cloud Services

   - T1087.004-Cloud Account is about using cloud accounts for lateral movement, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information is about collecting information about the victim, which is not directly related to lateral movement.
   - T1021-Remote Services is about using remote services for lateral movement, which is not specified in the CTI outline.
   - T1021.007-Cloud Services is about using cloud services for lateral movement, which is also not specified in the CTI outline.

   However, the CTI outline mentions that TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (such as SharpHound and PowerSploit) for reconnaissance and that they accessed shared folders over SMB using compromised domain credentials. This suggests that TG1021 was likely moving laterally within the network to access these shared folders.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of remote services or cloud services for lateral movement, but it does describe the use of offensive security tools and the exploitation of shared folders over SMB, which are indicative of lateral movement within the network.
   - None of the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D) directly match the lateral movement techniques described in the CTI outline.
   - However, if we must choose from the given options, T1021-Remote Services (C) is the closest to the concept of lateral movement, as it implies the use of remote services to move within a network.

Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
