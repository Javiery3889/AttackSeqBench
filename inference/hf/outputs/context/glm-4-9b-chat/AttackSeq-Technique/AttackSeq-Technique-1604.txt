Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Execution: Multi-stage PowerShell-based implant called Powersing, including Stage 0, 1, and 2.
- Persistence: Powersing creates a shortcut in the Windows startup folder for persistence.
- Defense Evasion: Powersing evades security software and looks for virtualization or malware analysis tools.
- Collection: Powersing captures screenshots and executes PowerShell scripts from the C&C server.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Collection

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used during communication with the C&C server involving JSON-encoded objects and leveraging public services as dead drop resolvers.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The CTI outline mentions that Powersing connects to a dead drop resolver to get the real C&C server address. This indicates that the communication with the C&C server is not direct and involves an intermediary service.
- The question specifies that the communication involves JSON-encoded objects, which is a common data format for transmitting structured data over a network.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: T1113-Screen Capture - This technique is related to collecting information from the victim's machine, not communication with the C&C server.
B: T1568.003-DNS Calculation - This technique is used for domain generation algorithms (DGA) and is not directly related to using public services as dead drop resolvers.
C: T1102-Web Service - This technique involves using web services for communication, which could be relevant if Powersing is using a public web service as a dead drop resolver.
D: T1568-Dynamic Resolution - This technique is used for resolving domain names dynamically, which could be relevant if Powersing is using a public service as a dead drop resolver.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that Powersing uses a dead drop resolver, which suggests the use of a public service for communication.
- The use of JSON-encoded objects is a common practice for structured data transmission, but it does not specify the communication method.
- Between T1102-Web Service and T1568-Dynamic Resolution, T1102-Web Service is more directly related to using a public service for communication, as it involves using web services.

Final Answer: C: T1102-Web Service
