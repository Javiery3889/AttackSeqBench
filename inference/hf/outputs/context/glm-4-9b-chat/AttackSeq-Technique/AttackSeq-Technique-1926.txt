1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Phishing email delivery of a malicious URL leading to a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' themed landing page.
     2. Initial Access: Execution of JavaScript files to profile the user's system and deliver the 'FriarFox' malicious Firefox browser extension.
     3. Defense Evasion: FriarFox extension installed, allowing access to Gmail and Firefox data, and contacting a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the action of the FriarFox extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTP of the FriarFox extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload can be matched with the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:
     A: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique involves using encrypted communication channels to hide the data being transmitted. While the extension may use encryption, the primary action is not the establishment of an encrypted channel.
     B: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods. The action described does not involve authentication.
     C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate. The extension is contacting a server, which suggests it is using a protocol to communicate.
     D: T1563-Remote Service Session Hijacking - This technique involves hijacking a session with a remote service. The action described does not involve hijacking a session.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The primary action described in the CTI outline is the FriarFox extension contacting a server to retrieve the Scanbox payload. This action is indicative of using a specific application layer protocol to communicate with the server.
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence is the use of an application layer protocol for communication.
   - Therefore, the answer that aligns best with the attack sequence is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
