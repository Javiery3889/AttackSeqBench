1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection), uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
   - Execution: Deploying custom malware ('IPsec Helper' .NET backdoor), used for exfiltration and deployment of additional malware.
   - Persistence: Deploying webshells, registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service for persistence.
   - Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation, 'IPsec Helper' with functionality to update its engine and delete traces.
   - Command and Control: 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicating with C2 servers over HTTP.
   - Impact: Deploying wipers ('Apostle', DEADWOOD) to destroy data.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely enabled Agrius to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network after using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.
   - The answer choices are:
     A: T1552.008-Chat Messages
     B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
     C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
     D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence in the CTI outline indicates that after gaining initial access and using webshells for lateral movement, Agrius deployed a custom malware backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for persistence and remote command and control.
   - The TTPs mentioned in the question are related to remote exploitation techniques within the targeted network.
   - Answer Choice A (T1552.008-Chat Messages) is not relevant as it involves using chat messages for lateral movement, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.
   - Answer Choice B (T1573-Encrypted Channel) is related to establishing encrypted communication channels, which is part of the Command and Control phase but not specifically about remote exploitation.
   - Answer Choice C (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) is about exploiting remote services, which aligns with the use of RDP for lateral movement and the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for remote control.
   - Answer Choice D (T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares) is about using SMB/Windows Admin Shares, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline describes the use of RDP for lateral movement and the deployment of a custom backdoor for remote control.
   - The TTPs in the question are related to remote exploitation techniques.
   - Answer Choice C (T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services) is the most relevant to the described attack sequence, as it involves exploiting remote services, which is consistent with the use of RDP and the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - Final Answer: C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
