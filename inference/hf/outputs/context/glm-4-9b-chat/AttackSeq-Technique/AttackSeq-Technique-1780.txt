1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Resource Development
     3. Initial Access
     4. Execution
     5. Persistence
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Command and Control
     10. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is after the Sayad malware has gathered information such as system details, running processes, and open ports from the compromised host.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs in the question are related to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:
     A: T1113-Screen Capture - This technique is not directly related to the gathering of system details, running processes, and open ports.
     B: T1560-Archive Collected Data - This technique involves archiving the collected data, which could be a step after gathering information but before encryption and exfiltration.
     C: T1612-Build Image on Host - This technique is not directly related to the gathering of system details, running processes, and open ports.
     D: T1598-Phishing for Information - This technique is part of the reconnaissance phase and is not relevant to the post-gathering phase.

Given the context of the question, the most plausible TTP that occurred after the Sayad malware gathered information such as system details, running processes, and open ports is T1560-Archive Collected Data, as it is a logical step before encryption and exfiltration.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The Sayad malware gathers information from the compromised host, which is a part of the Discovery phase.
   - The next logical step before encrypting and exfiltrating the data would be to organize or prepare this data for transmission.
   - T1113-Screen Capture and T1598-Phishing for Information are not relevant to the post-gathering phase.
   - T1612-Build Image on Host is not directly related to the gathering of system details, running processes, and open ports.
   - T1560-Archive Collected Data is the most plausible TTP as it involves organizing the collected data, which is a necessary step before exfiltration.

Final Answer: B: T1560-Archive Collected Data
