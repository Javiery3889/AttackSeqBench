1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Execution: Deployment of backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
     2. Persistence: Installation of RoyalDNS backdoor for persistent communication.
     3. Privilege Escalation: Use of Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
     4. Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings.
     5. Credential Access: Use of Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and steal a VPN certificate.
     6. Collection: Use of tools to export data from Active Directory, SQL databases, Sharepoint, and Exchange.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the technique that facilitated remote access to the network before the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the technique used for initial remote access before the deployment of RoyalDNS. However, we can infer that the initial remote access was necessary for the deployment of the backdoors and the subsequent actions.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1078.003-Local Accounts - This technique involves using local accounts to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to remote access.
     B: T1133-External Remote Services - This technique involves using external remote services to gain access to a network. This could be a plausible method for initial remote access.
     C: T1078-Valid Accounts - This technique involves using valid credentials to gain access to a system. While it could be used for remote access, it is more about using existing credentials rather than facilitating access.
     D: T1078.004-Cloud Accounts - This technique involves using cloud accounts to gain access to a network. There is no indication in the CTI outline that cloud accounts were used.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the initial remote access technique used by APT15. However, given the context of the outline, it is reasonable to infer that the initial remote access was facilitated by a method that would allow the deployment of the backdoors and the subsequent actions.
   - Among the provided answer choices, T1133-External Remote Services is the most plausible technique for facilitating remote access before the deployment of the RoyalDNS backdoor, as it directly relates to gaining access to a network.
   - Final Answer: B: T1133-External Remote Services
