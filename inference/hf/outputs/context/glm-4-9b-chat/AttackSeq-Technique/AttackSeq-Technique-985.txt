Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack begins with the Komplex Binder, followed by the Komplex Dropper, and then the Komplex Payload.
- Execution: The XAgent component's BootXLoader initializes, checking for a debugger and waiting for internet connectivity before communicating with C&C servers.
- Persistence: The Komplex Dropper ensures persistence, and the Launcher module within XAgent re-executes itself.
- Defense Evasion: XAgent checks for a debugger and uses a decoy PDF file.
- Credential Access: The Password module within XAgent collects passwords from Firefox browser profiles.
- Collection: The FileSystem module manages files, and the CameraShot module is intended for image capture.
- Command and Control: XAgent communicates with C&C servers using HTTPChannel.
- Exfiltration: The msgPacket structure is used for exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred after the InfoOS module gathered system information and the RemoteShell module listed installed applications and iPhone backups for Discovery.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is Discovery, which is part of the T1057-Process Discovery technique. This technique involves gathering information about the processes running on a system, installed applications, and other system details.
- The InfoOS module gathering system information and the RemoteShell module listing installed applications and iPhone backups align with the T1057-Process Discovery technique.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The InfoOS module and RemoteShell module's activities are consistent with the T1057-Process Discovery technique, which is used for discovery purposes.
- None of the other answer choices (T1090-Proxy, T1056.002-GUI Input Capture, T1040-Network Sniffing) directly relate to the discovery of system information and installed applications.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the InfoOS and RemoteShell modules' activities is T1057-Process Discovery.

Final Answer: B: T1057-Process Discovery
