Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attackers modified legitimate files on the Daily NK website to redirect users to attacker-owned domains hosting malicious JavaScript, targeting Internet Explorer users with CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 exploits.
- Command and Control: The BLUELIGHT malware, attributed to InkySquid, uses Microsoft Graph API for command and control operations.
- Others: The malware decrypts a final SVG variable containing a hex-encoded Cobalt Strike stager, which is then executed.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access (SWC, malicious code redirection)
2. Command and Control (BLUELIGHT malware, Microsoft Graph API)

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks for the ATT&CK technique that occurred after leveraging exploits on Internet Explorer users through CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 but before leveraging Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is after the initial exploitation of Internet Explorer users but before the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.
- Let's evaluate each answer choice:
  A: T1127-Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution - This technique is about using trusted developer utilities to execute code, which does not seem to fit the context of the question.
  B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique involves exploiting a public-facing application, which aligns with the initial access phase but does not necessarily indicate an action taken after the initial exploit.
  C: T1564-Hide Artifacts - This technique is about hiding evidence of an attack, which could be a plausible action after initial exploitation but before command and control.
  D: T1003.003-NTDS - This technique is about accessing domain information, which is not directly related to the sequence of events described.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of events described in the CTI outline starts with initial access through a strategic web compromise and the use of CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411 exploits. The next logical step would be to establish persistence or hide evidence of the attack before moving on to command and control operations.
- Among the answer choices, T1564-Hide Artifacts is the most plausible TTP that would occur after the initial exploitation but before the use of Microsoft Graph API for command and control.

Final Answer: C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
