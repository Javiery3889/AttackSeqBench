1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploit a year-old Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) using remote templates in Microsoft Word.
     2. Execution: Deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
     3. Persistence: Set up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.
     4. Defense Evasion: Use anti-forensics techniques and a basic backdoor to evade detection.
     5. Discovery: Collect system information and send it to the C2 server.
     6. Command and Control: Communicate with a C2 server, sending system information and receiving instructions.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the technique that most likely occurred before the initial access by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The initial access is achieved by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 through remote templates in Microsoft Word, which is a method of delivering a payload to the target system.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice in relation to the sequence of events leading up to the initial access:
     A: T1590.003-Network Trust Dependencies - This technique involves leveraging a network service to gain access to a system. It does not directly relate to the initial delivery of the payload.
     B: T1496.001-Compute Hijacking - This technique involves taking control of a system that is already running. It does not relate to the initial access phase.
     C: T1070-Indicator Removal - This technique involves removing evidence of an attack to avoid detection. It is a defense evasion technique that occurs after initial access, not before.
     D: T1598-Phishing for Information - This technique involves tricking a user into providing information that can be used to gain access to a system. It is a method of initial access that could involve delivering a payload through a malicious document, such as an RTF file with an exploit.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial access is achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Word, which is a form of phishing for information (T1598-Phishing for Information) as it tricks the user into opening a malicious document.
   - The other techniques listed (T1590.003, T1496.001, and T1070) are not directly related to the initial access phase.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs before the initial access is T1598-Phishing for Information.

Final Answer: D: T1598-Phishing for Information
