Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Lateral Movement
9. Collection
10. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
1. Established C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike
2. Exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the extracted attack sequence and the details in the question:

A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication
- This technique involves establishing a two-way communication channel. The CTI outline mentions the adversary using Cobalt Strike for C2 communication, which could be considered bidirectional. However, the primary focus of the question is on exfiltration, not just communication.

B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials
- This technique involves using additional cloud credentials to access cloud services. The CTI outline does not mention the use of additional cloud credentials, but it does mention exfiltration to cloud storage services.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This technique involves using a command and scripting interpreter to execute scripts. The CTI outline mentions the adversary using a PowerShell one-liner to install the Cobalt Strike beacon, which is a form of command and scripting interpreter. However, the primary focus of the question is on exfiltration.

D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
- This technique involves using an encrypted channel for exfiltration. The CTI outline mentions that the adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate data to cloud storage services, which implies the use of an encrypted channel for the exfiltration process.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline and the details in the question is the exfiltration of staged data using a custom-built tool to supported cloud storage services. This aligns with the T1573-Encrypted Channel technique, which involves using an encrypted channel for exfiltration.

Final Answer: D: T1573-Encrypted Channel
