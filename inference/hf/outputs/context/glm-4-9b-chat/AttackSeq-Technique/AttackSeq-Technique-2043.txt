1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Leveraging a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager.
     2. Execution: Execution of BlackEnergy 3 malware through a Visual Basic macro in an Excel document.
     3. Persistence: Registration of a binary to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function.
     4. Defense Evasion: Use of anti-debugging techniques.
     5. Discovery: Gathering information for lateral movement using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.
     6. Command and Control: Communication with a C2 server using HTTP protocol.
     7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration as a network sniffer.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is after the malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API, which is the Discovery phase in the attack sequence.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to enable lateral movement to other systems within the network. The TTPs that could enable lateral movement are:
     A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
     B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application
     C: T1021-Remote Services
     D: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token

   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention which TTP is used for lateral movement. However, we can infer that since the malware gathers network information, it is likely to use this information to move laterally within the network.

   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services - This technique involves exploiting a remote service to gain access to another system. The outline does not mention any remote service exploitation.
     B: T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application - This technique involves exploiting a publicly accessible application. The outline does not mention any public-facing application exploitation.
     C: T1021-Remote Services - This technique involves using remote services to move laterally. The outline does not mention remote services being used for lateral movement.
     D: T1134.003-Make and Impersonate Token - This technique involves creating or impersonating a token to gain access to other systems. The outline does not mention token impersonation.

   - None of the answer choices directly match the TTPs described in the CTI outline. However, if we have to choose the most plausible TTP based on the context of lateral movement, T1021-Remote Services seems the most fitting, as it is a general technique for lateral movement within a network.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack phase in question (Discovery).
   - Step 2: Determine the goal of the TTP (enabling lateral movement).
   - Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the context provided in the CTI outline.
   - Step 4: Choose the most plausible TTP for lateral movement.

Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services
