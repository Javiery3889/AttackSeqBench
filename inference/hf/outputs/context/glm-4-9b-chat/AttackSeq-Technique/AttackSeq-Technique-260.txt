1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The outline describes an attack where adversaries are using an open-source platform to maintain network persistence after compromising a network.
   - The attack sequence involves the use of Sliver to maintain access, which is not directly listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework but can be associated with T1055 (Persistence).
   - The context provided mentions that attackers are scanning for vulnerable instances of Apache Log4j, which is a known vulnerability (T1190 - Exploitation for Impact).
   - The outline also mentions that Google Cloud customers used scanners and fuzzers to identify Log4j, which could be associated with T1016 - Input Validation.
   - The outline does not explicitly state the initial access phase, but it does mention the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling, which is a technique to maintain access.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely to have occurred during the initial access phase to compromise external remote services.
   - The answer choices provided are T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging, T1078.001-Default Accounts, T1620-Reflective Code Loading, and T1133-External Remote Services.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling is a method to maintain access, which is more aligned with the Persistence tactic (T1055) rather than Initial Access (T1055.013-Process Doppelgänging).
   - T1078.001-Default Accounts is a technique that involves using default or common usernames and passwords to gain access, which is not mentioned in the outline.
   - T1620-Reflective Code Loading is a technique that involves using a vulnerability to load code from a network resource, which is not directly related to the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - T1133-External Remote Services is a technique that involves using external remote services to maintain access, which is consistent with the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The initial access phase is the stage where the attacker gains initial access to the target system or network.
   - The use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling is a method to maintain access, which is more closely related to the Persistence tactic (T1055) rather than Initial Access.
   - However, among the given answer choices, T1133-External Remote Services is the most plausible TTP for the initial access phase, as it involves using external services to maintain access, which could include the use of Cloud Shell for reverse SSH tunneling.
   - Therefore, the sequence of TTPs that most likely occurred during the initial access phase is T1133-External Remote Services.

Final Answer: T1133-External Remote Services
