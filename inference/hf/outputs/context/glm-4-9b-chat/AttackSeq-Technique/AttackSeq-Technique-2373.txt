Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives.
- Execution: The malware operates as a master program, infects removable media, and collects data from infected drives.
- Discovery: The malware collects detailed system information.
- Collection: The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated.
- Command and Control: Commands are received from an encrypted file on the local system.
- Exfiltration: The means of exfiltration are not determined, but the data collection functionality suggests the need for access to the 'master' system.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Discovery
4. Collection
5. Command and Control
6. Exfiltration

Step 2: Analyze the Question
The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred to clean up traces of the malware system and avoid detection. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is related to cleaning up or removing traces of the malware.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- A: T1562.003-Impair Command History Logging: This technique involves manipulating or deleting logs to prevent the detection of malicious activity. It is not directly related to cleaning up the malware system itself but rather to the logs of the system's activity.
- B: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing indicators of the presence of malware, such as files, registry entries, or other artifacts. This is directly related to the question's context of cleaning up the malware system.
- C: T1082-System Information Discovery: This technique is about gathering information about the system, which is what the malware is already doing, not about cleaning up.
- D: T1134-Access Token Manipulation: This technique involves manipulating access tokens to gain unauthorized access to resources, which is not directly related to cleaning up the malware system.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is focused on the final stages of the attack, which include Command and Control and Exfiltration. The question specifically asks about the technique used to clean up traces of the malware system and avoid detection. Among the answer choices, T1070-Indicator Removal (B) is the most directly related to this goal, as it involves the removal of indicators of the presence of malware, which is what would be necessary to avoid detection after the malware has been used for its intended purposes.

Final Answer: B: T1070-Indicator Removal
