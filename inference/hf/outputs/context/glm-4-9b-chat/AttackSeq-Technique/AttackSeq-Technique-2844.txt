Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: The attack starts with a dropper malware that downloads a second stage payload from the internet.
- Execution: The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is executed and sets a registry key for persistence.
- Persistence: 'upnphost.exe' maintains its presence on the system by setting a registry key.
- Defense Evasion: The dropper uses evasion techniques, and the dropper was patched to reveal its malicious behavior.
- Discovery: The malware sends system information to an IP address using a command line.
- Others: The attack surface is wide, and Yara rules are provided for the dropper and payloads.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Discovery

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the ATT&CK technique most likely used during the communication with the C2 server leveraging HTTPS with a POST method after the malware sent system information.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the communication with the C2 server using HTTPS with a POST method.
- Let's evaluate each answer choice:
  A: T1102.001-Dead Drop Resolver - This technique involves using a dead drop to store data, which is not directly related to the communication with a C2 server.
  B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate with a C2 server, which is relevant to the scenario described.
  C: T1072-Software Deployment Tools - This technique is about deploying software, not about communication with a C2 server.
  D: T1578.004-Revert Cloud Instance - This technique is about reverting cloud instances, which is not related to the communication with a C2 server.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The attack sequence in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTPS with a POST method, but the context provided in the "Others" section suggests that the malware communicates with a server using HTTPS.
- The most relevant technique from the answer choices that aligns with the communication with a C2 server using HTTPS is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
