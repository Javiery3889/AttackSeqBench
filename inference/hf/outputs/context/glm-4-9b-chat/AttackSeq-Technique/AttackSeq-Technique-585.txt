1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: Exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
     2. Execution: Used the AntSword webshell for system and user discovery, and to ping systems of interest.
     3. Defense Evasion: Used a custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert tool to evade detection.
     4. Credential Access: Used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass the hash technique.
     5. Discovery: Ran commands for initial discovery on the system and network.
     6. Command and Control: Used the AntSword webshell and AntSword Shell Manager for communication.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Used the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
     2. Dumped credentials using Mimikatz.
     3. Used Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The extracted attack sequence from the CTI outline matches the details in the question, with the exception of the order of credential dumping and the use of Impacket atexec. The outline does not specify the exact sequence of these actions, but it does mention that the actors used Impacket tools for command execution on other systems.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1087-Account Discovery - This technique involves discovering user accounts. While the actors did perform discovery, this is not the immediate action after using atexec.
     B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares - This technique involves using SMB to access admin shares. There is no mention of SMB or admin shares in the CTI outline.
     C: T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material - This technique involves using alternative authentication methods. The use of Mimikatz for credential dumping could be seen as using alternate authentication material, but it does not directly follow the use of atexec.
     D: T1137-Office Application Startup - This technique involves using an office application to execute code. The use of the AntSword webshell and Mimikatz could be seen as leveraging office applications for malicious purposes, which could be considered a form of T1137.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after using Impacket atexec to run commands on other systems would be the use of an office application to execute code, as the actors used the AntSword webshell and Mimikatz, which could be considered office applications in the context of webshells and credential dumping tools.
   - Final Answer: D: T1137-Office Application Startup
