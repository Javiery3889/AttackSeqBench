1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Defense Evasion: CosmicStrand modifies firmware images of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards with the H81 chipset.
     2. Defense Evasion: The rootkit is introduced into the CSMCORE DXE driver, redirecting the entry point to attacker-supplied code in the .reloc section, executed during system startup.
     3. Defense Evasion: CosmicStrand attempts to disable PatchGuard, a Windows kernel security mechanism, to avoid detection.
     4. Lateral Movement: The rootkit sets up hooks in the boot manager and Windows kernel loader to deploy a kernel-level implant into Windows systems at boot.
     5. Command and Control: CosmicStrand communicates with its C2 server using crafted UDP or TCP packets.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     1. Defense Evasion: Modifying firmware to redirect execution.
     2. Command and Control: Communicating with the C2 server using crafted UDP or TCP packets.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence from the CTI outline matches the sequence in the question, with the final step being communication with the C2 server.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1014-Rootkit - This is a technique used to install a rootkit, which is part of the initial attack, not the communication with the C2 server.
     B: T1008-Fallback Channels - This technique is used to establish communication channels that can be used if the primary channel is blocked. It is not directly related to the method of communication with the C2 server.
     C: T1001-Data Obfuscation - This technique is used to hide data, which is not directly related to the method of communication with the C2 server.
     D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol - This technique is used to communicate with a C2 server using non-standard protocols, which aligns with the description of using crafted UDP or TCP packets.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the attack sequence from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Match the sequence with the TTPs mentioned in the question.
   - Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice based on the attack sequence and the question's context.
   - Step 4: Determine that T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol is the most plausible sequence of TTPs for the communication with the C2 server.

Final Answer: D: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol
