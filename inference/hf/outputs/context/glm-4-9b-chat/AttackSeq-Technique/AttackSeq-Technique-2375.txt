1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Initial Access: The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives.
     2. Execution: The malware operates as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives.
     3. Defense Evasion: The malware includes features to clean up after itself by deleting key indicators of its presence and employs date sensitivity.
     4. Collection: The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated.
     5. Command and Control: The malware receives commands from an encrypted file on the local system.
     6. Exfiltration: The means of exfiltration are not determined.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
     - Defense Evasion: The malware collects detailed information about system properties during its reconnaissance phase.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The question asks about the TTP that most likely occurred during the reconnaissance phase when the malware collected detailed information about system properties.
   - The TTPs from the answer choices are:
     A: T1070-Indicator Removal
     B: T1082-System Information Discovery
     C: T1567.004-Exfiltration Over Webhook
     D: T1217-Browser Information Discovery

   - The CTI outline mentions that the malware collects system information and files from connected systems and shared drives, which aligns with the TTP T1082-System Information Discovery. This TTP involves gathering information about the system, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, which is consistent with the reconnaissance phase described in the question.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the TTPs involved in the reconnaissance phase from the CTI outline.
   - Step 2: Match the TTPs with the provided answer choices.
   - Step 3: Determine that T1082-System Information Discovery is the TTP that involves collecting detailed system information, which is consistent with the malware's behavior as described in the outline.
   - Step 4: Evaluate the other answer choices and conclude that they do not align with the described behavior of the malware during the reconnaissance phase.

Final Answer: B: T1082-System Information Discovery
