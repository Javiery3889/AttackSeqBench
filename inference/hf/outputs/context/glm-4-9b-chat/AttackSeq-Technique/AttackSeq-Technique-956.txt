1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: Exploitation of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits.
     - Privilege Escalation: Utilization of CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to obtain system privileges.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the implementation of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules to facilitate communications with the C&C server.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules. However, the question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the attackers achieved system-level access using the elevation of privilege exploit.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels: This technique involves using multiple stages to deliver payloads, which could be relevant if the Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules are part of a multi-stage delivery process.
     - B: T1222-File and Directory Permissions Modification: This technique is about changing file and directory permissions, which is not directly related to the implementation of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.
     - C: T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using phishing to deliver the initial access payload, which is not relevant to the current stage of the attack.
     - D: T1132.001-Standard Encoding: This technique is about encoding payloads to avoid detection, which is not directly related to the implementation of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The most plausible sequence of TTPs after achieving system-level access would be the delivery of the payload, which is typically done through a multi-stage process involving a Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.
   - Among the given answer choices, T1104-Multi-Stage Channels is the most relevant to the described scenario, as it involves the delivery of payloads in multiple stages, which aligns with the use of Stager, Dropper, and Remote shell modules.
   - Final Answer: A: T1104-Multi-Stage Channels
