1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: Exploitation of a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
     - Collection: Collection of malicious HWP file samples, often impersonating government inquiries or job-related documents.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is related to simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection after initially exploiting a Ghostscript vulnerability via malicious HWP files.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not directly mention the use of any specific ATT&CK technique for simplifying malicious EPS file code. However, we can infer that the attackers are looking to evade detection, which suggests a technique that would help in evading detection mechanisms.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     - A: T1114-Email Collection: This technique is about collecting email content, which is not directly related to simplifying malicious EPS file code.
     - B: T1574.009-Path Interception by Unquoted Path: This technique is about intercepting file paths, which is not directly related to simplifying malicious EPS file code.
     - C: T1574.011-Services Registry Permissions Weakness: This technique is about exploiting weaknesses in service registry permissions, which is not directly related to simplifying malicious EPS file code.
     - D: T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing indicators of malicious activity to avoid detection, which is directly related to the goal of simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The attack sequence described in the CTI outline involves the initial exploitation of a vulnerability and the collection of malicious files. The goal of the attackers is to evade detection, which suggests a technique that focuses on removing indicators of malicious activity.
   - Based on the evaluation of the answer choices, T1070-Indicator Removal is the most plausible sequence of TTPs for simplifying malicious EPS file code for better evasion from detection.
   - Final Answer: D: T1070-Indicator Removal
