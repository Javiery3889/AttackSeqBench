- Persistence: ThreatNeedle installer-type malware, loader-type malware for auto-execution.
- Defense Evasion: Deleting log files, custom web shell script, masquerading techniques.
- Credential Access: Credential harvesting tool Responder, acquiring login credentials.
- Lateral Movement: Windows commands, WMIC, compromised router VM, network connections, copying malware.
- Collection: Archiving collected data, preparing for exfiltration.
- Command and Control: Multiple servers, Apache web server on a compromised router as a proxy.
- Exfiltration: Custom tunneling tool, custom encryption routine, Trojanized VNC Uploader, HTTP POST requests.
