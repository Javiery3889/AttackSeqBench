Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Initial Access
  3. Execution
  4. Persistence
  5. Privilege Escalation
  6. Defense Evasion
  7. Credential Access
  8. Lateral Movement
  9. Collection
  10. Command and Control
  11. Exfiltration
  12. Others

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  - After using WMI to execute commands remotely for lateral movement, the next step is to gather information on network configuration to support operational objectives.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The TTPs in the question are related to the Lateral Movement and Collection phases of the attack.
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique is most likely used to gather information on network configuration after using WMI for lateral movement.
- Let's evaluate each answer choice:
  A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery - This technique is about discovering the internet connection details of a system, which is not directly related to network configuration.
  B: T1505-Server Software Component - This technique is about identifying server software components, which might be useful for reconnaissance but not specifically for gathering network configuration.
  C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery - This technique is about discovering the network configuration of a system, which is directly related to the question's context.
  D: T1078.001-Default Accounts - This technique is about identifying default accounts, which is not related to gathering network configuration.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The TTP that matches the context of gathering information on network configuration after using WMI for lateral movement is T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery.
- This technique is directly related to the task of understanding the network environment, which is crucial for an attacker to support their operational objectives.

Final Answer: C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery
