Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- Initial Access: Spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb'
- Defense Evasion: Obfuscation, hiding from debuggers and sandbox software, entry point named 'gholee'
- Command and Control: Communication with a Kuwait-based IP address, SSL connection over port 443, HTTP communication pattern
- Others: Detection and prevention measures, Yara rule for detection

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
1. Initial Access (Spear phishing attack)
2. Defense Evasion (Obfuscation, hiding from debuggers and sandbox software)
3. Command and Control (Communication with a Kuwait-based IP address)

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the malicious Excel file gains initial access and macros are enabled to construct a PE file.
- The TTPs mentioned in the question are:
  - Constructing a PE file from macros
  - Gholee malware employing ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C for process execution while hiding its activity

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The sequence of TTPs in the question involves the construction of a PE file and the execution of the Gholee malware.
- Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the context provided:

A: T1559.002-Dynamic Data Exchange
- This technique involves using DDE to exchange data between applications. It does not seem to be directly related to the construction of a PE file or the execution of the Gholee malware.

B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
- This technique involves using command-line interpreters to execute scripts. While it could be related to the execution of the Gholee malware, it does not address the construction of the PE file.

C: T1583.003-Virtual Private Server
- This technique is about using a VPS for command and control. It is not related to the construction of a PE file or the execution of the Gholee malware.

D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
- This technique involves using application layer protocols to communicate. It could be related to the communication with the Kuwait-based IP address for command and control, but it does not address the construction of the PE file.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The sequence of TTPs in the question involves the construction of a PE file and the execution of the Gholee malware.
- The most plausible technique that occurs before the execution is the one that is directly related to the construction of the PE file.
- None of the provided answer choices directly address the construction of the PE file. However, if we have to choose the most relevant technique from the given options, T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter (B) seems the most plausible, as it could involve using a scripting interpreter to construct the PE file from the macros.

Final Answer: B: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter
