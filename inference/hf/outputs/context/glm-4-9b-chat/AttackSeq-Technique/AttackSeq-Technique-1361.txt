Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline
- The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
  1. Initial Access: The attack leverages the CVE-2015-5119 exploit code.
  2. Initial Access: The exploit code is hosted at a spoofed website.
  3. Execution: A file is saved at "%Temp%/Rdws.exe" and executed.
  4. Persistence: The executed file writes another file at "%TEMP%/adobe.dat."
  5. Lateral Movement: The first stage downloader retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
  6. Command and Control: The second stage PlugX file connects to several C2 domains.

Step 2: Analyze the Question
- The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
  1. Exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to save and execute "%Temp%/Rdws.exe".
  2. Retrieving a second-stage PlugX file.
  3. Facilitating communication with C2 domains such as inocnation[.]com.

Step 3: Compare and Evaluate
- The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely facilitated communication with C2 domains after the second stage PlugX file was retrieved.
  A: T1001.002-Steganography - This technique involves hiding data within other files or data. There is no indication in the CTI outline that steganography was used for communication.
  B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique involves using common application layer protocols to communicate with C2 servers. The CTI outline mentions that the PlugX file connected to several C2 domains, which suggests the use of application layer protocols.
  C: T1189-Drive-by Compromise - This technique involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins to compromise systems without user interaction. It is not relevant to the communication with C2 domains.
  D: T1005-Data from Local System - This technique involves using data from the local system to communicate with C2 servers. There is no indication in the CTI outline that data from the local system was used for communication.

Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI outline indicates that the second stage PlugX file connected to several C2 domains, which suggests the use of application layer protocols for communication.
- The most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is that the PlugX file used an application layer protocol to communicate with the C2 domains.

Final Answer: B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol
