1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     - Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
     - Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7, with the icon hidden and the ability to restart immediately. On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
     - Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, Wi-Fi status, and more.

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the technique used to facilitate communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the communication technique used by the malware to communicate with a C2 server. However, we can infer that the malware would need to use some form of network communication to send the gathered information to its command and control server.
   - Let's evaluate each answer choice:
     A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning - This technique is used to redirect network traffic to a malicious server, but it does not directly relate to using POST and GET requests for communication.
     B: T1102-Web Service - This technique involves using web services for command and control communication, which could include POST and GET requests.
     C: T1518-Software Discovery - This technique is about identifying software on a system, not about facilitating communication with a C2 server.
     D: T1001.001-Junk Data - This technique is about using junk data to avoid detection, not about communication with a C2 server.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - The CTI outline does not provide direct evidence of the communication technique used by the malware. However, based on the context of the question and the available answer choices, the most plausible technique that would involve using POST and GET requests for communication with a C2 server is T1102-Web Service.
   - Final Answer: B: T1102-Web Service
