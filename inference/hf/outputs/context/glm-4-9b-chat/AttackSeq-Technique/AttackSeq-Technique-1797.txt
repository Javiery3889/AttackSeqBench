1. Analyze the CTI Outline:
   - The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:
     1. Reconnaissance
     2. Initial Access
     3. Execution
     4. Persistence
     5. Privilege Escalation
     6. Defense Evasion
     7. Credential Access
     8. Discovery
     9. Lateral Movement
     10. Command and Control
     11. Exfiltration

2. Analyze the Question:
   - The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is the one that occurred before the initial access through spear-phishing emails using weaponized Word documents with malicious macros and links to malicious sites.

3. Compare and Evaluate:
   - The TTPs listed in the question are:
     A: T1218.013-Mavinject
     B: T1566-Phishing
     C: T1587-Develop Capabilities
     D: T1587.003-Digital Certificates

   - The CTI outline states that the initial access was gained through spear-phishing emails. This aligns with T1566-Phishing, which is a technique used to deliver malicious content to a target through email.

   - T1218.013-Mavinject is a technique that involves using malicious documents to deliver a payload, which could be a part of the initial access phase but is not the primary method described in the outline.

   - T1587-Develop Capabilities is a broad category that could include the development of tools or techniques but does not specifically pertain to the initial access vector described.

   - T1587.003-Digital Certificates is a technique that involves using digital certificates for various purposes, such as signing code or establishing secure connections, but it is not directly related to the initial access vector of spear-phishing.

4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer:
   - Step 1: Identify the initial access vector described in the CTI outline, which is spear-phishing emails.
   - Step 2: Match the initial access vector with the TTPs provided.
   - Step 3: Determine that T1566-Phishing is the most relevant TTP as it directly corresponds to the initial access vector described.

Final Answer: B: T1566-Phishing
