**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attack begins with reconnaissance, where SCILabs identified a new Cosmic Banker attack targeting user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
2. Initial Access: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria (SAT), warning of a pending tax return, which includes a link to download a malicious attachment.
3. Execution: The malicious attachment triggers the attack, which includes a batch programming script that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
4. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
5. Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
6. Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials from Mexican financial institution users by displaying text related to an alleged data update request and accessing Outlook info to collect email accounts from the contacts list.
7. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
8. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with the domains h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net to download the malware and send collected data.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the collected email accounts will be exfiltrated to cyber actors using the domain dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net only before sending them through a POST web request.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline states that the malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request. It also mentions that the PowerShell script communicates with the domains h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net to download the malware and send collected data.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the collected email accounts will be sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request, but it does not specify that they will be exfiltrated to dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net only before sending them through a POST web request.

However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the order in which the domains are used. It only mentions that the PowerShell script communicates with both domains to download the malware and send collected data.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact order in which the domains are used. However, the question asks whether the collected email accounts will be exfiltrated to cyber actors using the domain dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net only before sending them through a POST web request.

Since the CTI outline does not provide information about the order in which the domains are used, and the question asks for a specific sequence of events, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the information provided.

However, considering the structure of the question and the answer choices, it seems that the question is asking for a yes or no answer. In this case, the most plausible answer is "No" because the CTI outline does not provide information about the domain dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net being used exclusively for exfiltrating the collected email accounts before sending them through a POST web request.

**Final Answer: B**
