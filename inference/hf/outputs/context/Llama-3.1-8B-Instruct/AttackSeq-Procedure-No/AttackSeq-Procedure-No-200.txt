**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the GreyEnergy group's initial access methods:

1. Compromising a public-facing web service on a server connected to an internal network.
2. Using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to drop "GreyEnergy mini", a lightweight first-stage backdoor.

After initial access, the attackers:

1. Map the network using Nmap.
2. Collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges using Mimikatz.
3. Use the obtained privileges to control the whole network.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using Nmap and Mimikatz.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention PDQ Deploy, AvosLocker, or any other tools besides Nmap and Mimikatz. However, it does describe the GreyEnergy group's use of standard tools for network mapping and credential collection. The question implies a specific tool (PDQ Deploy) and malware (AvosLocker) that are not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy, as it is not mentioned as part of their standard tools. The CTI outline focuses on the group's use of Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the GreyEnergy group's standard tools for network mapping and credential collection are Nmap and Mimikatz. There is no mention of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. Therefore, it is unlikely that the GreyEnergy group would use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network.

Final Answer: B
