**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack targeting iOS users in Hong Kong, which involves a watering hole attack, exploitation of iOS vulnerabilities, and the installation of a malware variant named lightSpy. The malware has a modular design, allowing for data exfiltration, remote command execution, and file manipulation. The attack sequence can be broken down into the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: Watering hole attack targeting iOS users in Hong Kong.
2. Execution: Exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to install the lightSpy malware.
3. Defense Evasion: Employing a sophisticated spyware with a modular design, using a customized kernel exploit to gain root privileges, and maintaining control over the device.
4. Collection: Collecting and exfiltrating a wide range of data from the infected device, including hardware information, contacts, text messages, call history, saved WiFi information, browser history, and user location.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the lightSpy malware is likely to use DNS Calculation to determine the command and control port for module updates and data exfiltration after collecting data.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention DNS Calculation as a technique used by the lightSpy malware. However, it does mention that the malware uses a modular design with capabilities for module updates, remote command dispatch per module, and complete shell command execution. This suggests that the malware may use some form of communication with a command and control (C2) server to receive updates and instructions.

However, the question specifically asks about DNS Calculation, which is a technique used to determine the command and control port for module updates and data exfiltration. The CTI outline does not provide any information about the malware using DNS Calculation for this purpose.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the lightSpy malware uses DNS Calculation to determine the command and control port for module updates and data exfiltration. However, the fact that the malware uses a modular design and has capabilities for module updates and remote command execution suggests that it may use some form of communication with a C2 server.

Since the CTI outline does not provide any information about DNS Calculation, and the question specifically asks about this technique, the most plausible answer is that the lightSpy malware is not likely to use DNS Calculation for determining the command and control port.

**Final Answer: B**
