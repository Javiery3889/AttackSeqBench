**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Chinese APT group Deep Panda. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Resource Development**: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability allowed them to gain initial access.
3. **Execution**: The attack chain involved the execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
4. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: The 2016 version of the Milestone backdoor creates a new administrator user and executes another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Deep Panda's campaign involved the use of a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, which hides and protects malicious artifacts.
7. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
8. **Exfiltration**: The Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after employing system information discovery and screen capture capabilities, it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence, the Milestone backdoor has already been deployed and is operating on the compromised system. The question asks about the next step after system information discovery and screen capture capabilities have been employed. Given that the Milestone backdoor has already been installed and is capable of exfiltrating data over the C2 channel, it is likely that the next step would involve communication with the C2 server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data.

The question does not specify the port used for communication, but it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will use the same C2 channel for communication as it does for exfiltration. Therefore, the answer choice that suggests communication with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltration is the most plausible sequence of TTPs.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
