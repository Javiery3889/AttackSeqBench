**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Execution (using JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying)
4. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR)
5. Privilege Escalation (utilizing common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks)
6. Defense Evasion (employing defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion)
7. Credential Access (using techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials)
8. Lateral Movement (using WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13 after using WMI for lateral movement across the victim network. The question specifically asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement (step 8). After gaining access to the network, they would likely use various techniques to gather information on user accounts, including:

* Memory dumping LSASS (step 7: Credential Access) to obtain credentials
* Network sniffing (step 7: Credential Access) to obtain credentials
* Utilizing native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts as part of their internal reconnaissance ( Privilege Escalation, step 5)

Therefore, the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Lateral Movement (using WMI)
2. Credential Access (memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing)
3. Privilege Escalation (utilizing native OS binaries and scripts for gathering information on user accounts)

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
