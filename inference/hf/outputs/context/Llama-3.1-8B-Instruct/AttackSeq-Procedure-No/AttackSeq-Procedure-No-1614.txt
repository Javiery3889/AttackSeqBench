**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attack begins with reconnaissance, where SCILabs identified a new Cosmic Banker attack targeting user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
2. Initial Access: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, warning of a pending tax return, and includes a link to download a malicious attachment.
3. Execution: The malicious attachment triggers the attack, which includes a batch programming script that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
4. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
5. Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
6. Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials from Mexican financial institution users.
7. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from the contacts list.
8. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with remote domains to download the malware and send collected data.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the collected email accounts will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers after accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that after accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI, the malware sends the collected email accounts to the cyber actors through a POST web request (Collection phase). There is no mention of FTP being used for exfiltration.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the malware sends the collected email accounts through a POST web request, not FTP. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
