**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents were used to gain initial access.
2. Execution: The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines.
3. Persistence: The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
4. Defense Evasion: The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain.
5. Discovery: The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. Collection: The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
7. Command and Control: The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port.
8. Exfiltration: The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after the backdoor installed by the attackers exfiltrates data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication, it is likely that it will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention CaddyWiper or any wiping of files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions. However, it does mention that the backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including system information. This suggests that the attackers may be interested in gathering information about the victim's system, but there is no indication that they would deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence does not indicate that the attackers would deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions. The attackers' primary goal appears to be gathering information and exfiltrating data, rather than destructive actions.

Final Answer: B
