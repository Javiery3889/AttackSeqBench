**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the GreyEnergy group's initial access methods, which include:

1. Compromising a public-facing web service to gain access to the internal network.
2. Using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to drop the "GreyEnergy mini" backdoor.

After compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, the attackers:

1. Map the network.
2. Collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

The tools used by the GreyEnergy group for these tasks are:

1. Nmap (for mapping the network)
2. Mimikatz (for collecting credentials)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network before using Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools by the GreyEnergy group. However, it does mention the use of Nmap and Mimikatz for mapping the network and collecting credentials, respectively. The question asks about the sequence of events after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is likely that the GreyEnergy group will use Nmap and Mimikatz directly after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, as these tools are specifically mentioned as part of their tactics.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the GreyEnergy group's tactics do not include the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools. The question asks about the sequence of events after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini, and the CTI outline does not provide information about the use of these tools in this context.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the GreyEnergy group will not use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network before using Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.

Final Answer: B
