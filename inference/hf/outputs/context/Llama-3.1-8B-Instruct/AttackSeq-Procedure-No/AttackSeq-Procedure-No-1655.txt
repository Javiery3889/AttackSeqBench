**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the FHAPPI campaign, which involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website. The malware was a VBScript encoded script that, when executed, would download a .doc file and open it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access: APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
2. Execution: VBScript encoded script execution.
3. Execution: Downloading a .doc file.
4. Execution: Opening the .doc file, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
5. Command and Control: Malware communicates with a C2 server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution only before the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline states that the malware was a VBScript encoded script, which implies that the script was encoded, but it does not explicitly state that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code. However, it does mention that the attack utilized multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding. This suggests that base64 encoding was used in the attack, but it is not clear if it was used in the PowerShell command.

The CTI outline also states that the malware would download a .doc file and open it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack. This implies that the PowerShell attack would occur after the .doc file is opened, not before.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, it is likely that the PowerShell command will run after the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, not before. The use of base64 encoding is also possible, but it is not explicitly stated that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
