**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR)
4. Privilege Escalation (utilizing common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks)
5. Defense Evasion (employing defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion)
6. Credential Access (using techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials)
7. Discovery (leveraging native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance)
8. Lateral Movement (using WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries, after employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. This suggests that FIN13 does not necessarily use initial access methods (such as exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware) as a primary means of establishing persistence.

However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events after employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE. According to the CTI outline, FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, but it does not explicitly state that they use initial access methods only after establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

Given the information provided, it is not clear whether FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence. The CTI outline suggests that FIN13 uses a variety of TTPs for different stages of the attack, but it does not provide a clear sequence of events that would indicate a specific order of operations.

However, considering the nature of FIN13's operations, it is likely that they would use initial access methods (such as exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware) to establish a foothold in the victim's network, and then use other methods (such as SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries) to establish persistence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of events is that FIN13 would use initial access methods (such as exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware) to establish a foothold in the victim's network, and then use other methods (such as SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries) to establish persistence.

However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of events after employing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE. Since BLUEAGAVE is used for initial access, it is likely that FIN13 would use other methods to establish persistence after establishing a foothold.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
