**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Darkhotel APT. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices.
2. Resource Development: The Darkhotel APT compromises trusted commercial network resources on a global scale.
3. Initial Access: The Darkhotel APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates.
4. Execution: The Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components, including small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.
5. Defense Evasion: The Darkhotel APT uses digital certificates to sign their backdoors and employs techniques to encrypt and store gathered data.
6. Credential Access: The Darkhotel APT's information stealer module targets stored secrets in various browsers and email services.
7. Collection: The Darkhotel APT's keylogger module encrypts and stores gathered data in log files.
8. Command and Control: The Darkhotel APT maintains a web interface for victim management.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems by replacing the pam_unix.so file with a malicious version after deploying malware components.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Execution phase, where the Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components. The question asks about maintaining persistence, which is typically associated with the Persistence phase. However, the question does not explicitly mention the Persistence phase.

The answer choices are:

A: Yes
B: No

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the Darkhotel APT's tactics and techniques do not explicitly mention replacing the pam_unix.so file with a malicious version. The CTI outline describes various malware components, such as small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, but does not mention the pam_unix.so file.

However, the question asks about maintaining persistence, which is a common technique used by attackers to ensure continued access to compromised systems. While the CTI outline does not explicitly mention replacing the pam_unix.so file, it does describe the Darkhotel APT's use of digital certificates to sign their backdoors, which could be used to maintain persistence.

Given the lack of information about the pam_unix.so file in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that the Darkhotel APT would use this specific technique to maintain persistence. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
