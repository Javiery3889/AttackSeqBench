**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence by 'Energetic Bear' on a Turkish energy company's website. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The website was compromised through a supply chain attack and used in a watering hole attack.
2. Credential Access: SMB credential-harvesting malware was used to facilitate this access.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if 'Energetic Bear' will conduct widespread scanning of target environments to identify vulnerabilities for exploit before compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions a sequence of TTPs: 
- Widespread scanning of target environments to identify vulnerabilities for exploit
- Compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack
- Conducting a watering hole attack

Comparing this sequence with the CTI outline, we can see that the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the first TTP (widespread scanning of target environments). However, it does mention the use of SMB credential-harvesting malware, which implies that the attackers may have identified vulnerabilities in the target environment before compromising the website.

The CTI outline does mention a supply chain attack and a watering hole attack, which aligns with the second and third TTPs in the question.

However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the attackers conducting widespread scanning of target environments before the supply chain attack. The focus is more on the use of SMB credential-harvesting malware and the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, it is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline that 'Energetic Bear' conducted widespread scanning of target environments before the supply chain attack. The CTI outline focuses more on the use of SMB credential-harvesting malware and the compromise of the Turkish energy company's website.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that 'Energetic Bear' will conduct widespread scanning of target environments before compromising a Turkish energy company's website through a supply chain attack to conduct a watering hole attack.

Final Answer: B
