**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, install BlackEnergy 3 on employee workstations, and gain access to the corporate network.
3. Execution: Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
4. Credential Access: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log keystrokes, and access the domain controller.
5. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled CC server.
6. Impact: Adversaries gain unauthorized access to targeted networks, including the ability to deliver additional BlackEnergy plugins to enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
7. Impact: Adversaries develop malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.
8. Impact: Adversaries deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot.
9. Impact: Adversaries schedule unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers.
10. Impact: Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers.
11. Impact: Adversaries deliver malicious computer code update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices, rendering the converters inoperable, and sever connections between the control center and the substations.
12. Impact: Adversaries initiate a DoS attack on the telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors.
13. Impact: Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers.
14. Impact: Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims' corporate and ICS network.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after developing a malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters, adversaries will likely use valid credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins to conduct internal reconnaissance and access the control environment before credential harvesting using delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins for expanding access across the corporate network.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after developing a malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters. The CTI outline indicates that after developing the malicious computer code update, the adversaries deliver the malicious updates to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices, rendering the converters inoperable, and sever connections between the control center and the substations (Step 14). This is followed by a DoS attack on the telephone call center (Step 15), a scheduled UPS outage (Step 12), and the execution of KillDisk malware (Step 17).

However, the question specifically asks about conducting internal reconnaissance and accessing the control environment before credential harvesting. The CTI outline indicates that credential harvesting occurs after the adversaries have already gained access to the control environment (Step 7: Harvest Credentials).

Given the sequence of events, it is unlikely that the adversaries would conduct internal reconnaissance and access the control environment after developing the malicious computer code update, as they have already gained access to the control environment through other means.
