**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of Tropic Trooper, also known as KeyBoy, which includes:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to download and install an installer package (.msi).
2. Execution: The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which in turn drops a normal sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader (in"C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"), and an encrypted configuration file. UserInstall.exe abuses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
3. Persistence: The backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file, decrypts it, and uses SSL protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.
4. Command and Control: TClient uses SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. The question specifically asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe only after using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to download and install an installer package (.msi).
2. Execution: The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which in turn drops a normal sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader (in"C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"), and an encrypted configuration file. UserInstall.exe abuses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

The question specifically asks about the sequence after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe. The CTI outline does not mention the FakeRun loader, but it does describe the malicious loader (wab32res.dll) using DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launching dllhost.exe.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to download and install an installer package (.msi).
2. Execution: The system configuration file (in.sys) drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), which in turn drops a normal sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader (in"C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"), and an encrypted configuration file. UserInstall.exe abuses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.

The question specifically asks about the sequence after injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does describe the malicious loader (wab32res.dll) using DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launching dllhost.exe. This suggests that the correct sequence is not necessarily related to the FakeRun loader.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
