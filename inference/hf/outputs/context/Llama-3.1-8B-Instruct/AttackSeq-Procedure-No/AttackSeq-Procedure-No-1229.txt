**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the execution of a malicious attack by the Lazarus group on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB). The attack sequence involves the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Execution: 
   - Deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) that established persistence via a registry key and attempted to disable specific antivirus processes.
   - Utilized a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, which was decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
   - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), packed with Themida, designed to communicate with command and control servers.

2. Persistence: 
   - Established persistence on the FEIB network by placing a copy of the loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) in the C:\Windows\Temp directory and setting a registry key for automatic execution.
   - Attempted to spread itself to other devices on the network using hardcoded user accounts and passwords related to FEIB.

3. Defense Evasion: 
   - Attempted to kill specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command line tool.
   - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image, which was then decrypted and executed.
   - Packed the backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) with Themida to evade analysis and detection.

4. Lateral Movement: 
   - Attempted lateral movement within the FEIB network by copying the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
   - Established connections to SMB shares using the provided credentials.

5. Command and Control: 
   - The backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote command and control servers.
   - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number, and it polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute, maintaining a communication session and executing remote commands as directed.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Lazarus group established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands after deploying Hermes ransomware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the Lazarus group utilized backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with remote command and control servers, which is a key component of the Command and Control tactic. This malware was designed to poll the remote C&C for tasks to execute and maintain a communication session.

The question specifically asks about the use of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control communication after deploying Hermes ransomware. Given the information in the CTI outline, it is clear that the Lazarus group used this malware for command and control purposes in the FEIB heist.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

1. The CTI outline describes the use of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) for command and control communication in the FEIB heist.
2. The question specifically asks about the use of this malware for command and control communication after deploying Hermes ransomware.
3. Given the information in the CTI outline, it is clear that the Lazarus group used this malware for command and control purposes.
4. Therefore, it is likely that they established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

**Final Answer: A**
