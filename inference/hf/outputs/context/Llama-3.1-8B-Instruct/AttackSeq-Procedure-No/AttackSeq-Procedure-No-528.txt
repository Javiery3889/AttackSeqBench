**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Dropping Elephant threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities with spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
2. Initial Access: The threat actor uses spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server upon opening, or exploits CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352 in MS Word or PowerPoint documents.
3. Execution: The backdoor used by the threat actor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
4. Credential Access: The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials among other data.
5. Collection: The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
6. Command and Control: The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, which can be spotted by analyzing firewall log files.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant threat actor will use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files before evading detection by decoding the encoded blobs.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention steganography as a technique used by the Dropping Elephant threat actor. However, it does mention that the backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts. This suggests that the threat actor does use encoding to evade detection, but it does not specify the use of steganography.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
