**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Regin threat, a sophisticated multi-staged modular threat. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access (unconfirmed infection vector, possibly through a web browser or exploiting an application)
2. Execution (six stages: Stage 0 - dropper, Stage 1 - kernel driver, Stage 2 - kernel driver, Stage 3 - kernel mode DLL, Stage 4 - user-mode orchestrator and kernel payload modules, Stage 5 - main Regin payload functionality)
3. Persistence (long-term presence on infected systems, multi-staged architecture, kernel drivers, and EVFS containers)
4. Defense Evasion (concealment techniques, encrypted data blobs, non-traditional file storage areas)
5. Credential Access (stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, scanning for deleted files)
6. Discovery (gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, retrieving them, monitoring network traffic)
7. Command and Control (bidirectional C&C operations, encrypted communications, various protocols)
8. Exfiltration (encoding and embedding payload information, exfiltrating data through various channels)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The discovery phase is mentioned in the CTI outline as part of the Regin threat's capabilities. According to the CTI report, Regin's discovery capabilities include:

* Gathering information on processes and memory utilization
* Scanning for deleted files
* Retrieving deleted files
* Monitoring network traffic

This matches the question's requirements.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, Regin's discovery phase involves gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and retrieving them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
