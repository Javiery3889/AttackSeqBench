**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the APT-TOCS attack, which involves the following sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The attackers used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems.
2. Defense Evasion: The attackers exhibited features designed to evade detection by security software and firewall interception, including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and the use of multi-beacon communication.
3. Lateral Movement: The attackers depended on network projection and could laterally move within the internal network as required to conduct an attack.
4. Command and Control: The attackers used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses during the attack's core step instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems during Initial Access. However, it does not explicitly state that PowerShell scripts were used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory. In fact, the Defense Evasion tactic mentions that the attackers exhibited features designed to evade detection, but it does not specify the use of PowerShell scripts for credential harvesting.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is more likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory, rather than PowerShell scripts being used for credential harvesting.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
