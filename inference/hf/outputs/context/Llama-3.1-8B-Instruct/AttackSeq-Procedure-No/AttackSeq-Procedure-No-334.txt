**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack using Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with a PDF document attached, containing the spyware, were sent to diplomats.
2. Command and Control: The spyware communicates with C&C servers.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system. However, it does describe the spyware being disguised as a PDF document attached to a spearphishing email, which is a common tactic for initial access. The question asks about the sequence of events after initial access, specifically before establishing communication with the C&C servers.

Given the information in the CTI outline, we can infer that the attack sequence is:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with a PDF document attached, containing the spyware.
2. Command and Control: The spyware communicates with C&C servers.

The question asks about the use of a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the C&C servers. This is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a common tactic used by some malware families to evade detection and establish persistence.

However, the CTI outline does not provide any information about the use of a portable FAT16 partition image in this specific attack. Therefore, we cannot confirm that this tactic was used.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot confirm that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers. The CTI outline only describes the initial access and command and control phases, but does not provide information about the use of this specific tactic.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

Final Answer: B
