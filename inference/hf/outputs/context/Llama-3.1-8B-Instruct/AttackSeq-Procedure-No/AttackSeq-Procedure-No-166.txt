**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT10, a China-based threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
2. Execution: Deploying malware (PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT) to establish a foothold on the target network.
3. Execution: Performing internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
4. Execution: Ensuring access to legitimate credentials, often using MSP credentials, and deploying credential theft tools (mimikatz or PwDump).
5. Execution: Installing updates and new malware on compromised systems, using methods like reverse shell or RDP connections to propagate across the network.
6. Persistence: Achieving persistence on victim networks through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
7. Privilege Escalation: Using credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions on compromised systems.
8. Defense Evasion: Using bespoke in-house malware (ChChes and RedLeaves) and open-source malware (Quasar) with DLL search order hijacking and sideloading.
9. Credential Access: Deploying tools (mimikatz or PwDump) to steal credentials, often using DLL load order hijacking.
10. Discovery: Conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
11. Collection: Identifying systems of interest and staging data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
12. Command and Control: Using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure.
13. Exfiltration: Pushing data from victim networks to other networks and pulling data to locations from which they can directly obtain it.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on two specific TTPs:

1. Abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.
2. Leveraging shared MSP infrastructure.
3. Staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement. However, it does mention using legitimate credentials, including MSP credentials, to gain access to the network. The outline also describes using shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, APT10 has been observed using legitimate credentials, including MSP credentials, to gain access to the network and leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration. The outline does not mention abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is not abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
