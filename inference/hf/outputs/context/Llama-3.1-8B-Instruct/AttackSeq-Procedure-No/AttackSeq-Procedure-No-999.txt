**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Longhorn group, a threat actor. The outline is organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets.
2. Defense Evasion: Longhorn employs practices such as wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols to avoid detection.
3. Collection: Longhorn's malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules for espionage-type operations.
4. Command and Control: Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers and uses a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.
5. Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times with upload limits on exfiltrated data and randomization of communication intervals.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Longhorn after engaging in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration during the collection phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions system information discovery as part of the discovery operations. Based on the CTI outline, we can see that Longhorn's malware is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration. This suggests that system information discovery is likely part of the collection phase, not the discovery phase.

The question also mentions employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion. According to the CTI outline, Longhorn's tools follow the guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents, and they employ practices such as wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols to avoid detection. This suggests that Longhorn would likely employ these tactics for defense evasion.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Collection: Longhorn engages in detailed system fingerprinting and exfiltration.
2. Defense Evasion: Longhorn employs tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation to avoid detection.

The question asks if Longhorn is likely to use its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations only after employing tactics like wipe-on-use and in-memory string de-obfuscation for defense evasion. Based on the CTI outline, the correct answer is that Longhorn would not perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations after employing these tactics, as system information discovery is part of the collection phase.

However, the question asks if Longhorn is likely to use its malware built for espionage to perform system information discovery after employing these tactics, which is not the case. The correct answer is that Longhorn would not perform system information discovery as part of its discovery operations after employing these tactics, but the question asks if it would do so after employing these tactics, which is not the case.

The correct answer is B: No, because the question asks if Longhorn would perform system information discovery after employing these tactics, which is not the case.

Final Answer: B
