**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying attack against remote services.
2. Execution: Installing Cobalt Strike beacon in memory using PowerShell one-liner.
3. Persistence: Loading Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms.
4. Privilege Escalation: Password spraying attack against domain admin accounts or moving laterally to another system with a domain admin logged in.
5. Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces from intrusions, including Windows event logs clearing, file deletion, and timestomping.
6. Credential Access: Achieving credentials access by brute force, credential stuffing, or password spraying.
7. Discovery: Applying a wide range of discovery tactics, including using PsLogList to export Security Event log contents.
8. Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities, such as SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
9. Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike as a framework to manage compromised systems.
10. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating small amounts of data using the command and control channel, and large amounts of data using a custom-built tool.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services before copying results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data, such as mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property, after compressing, encrypting, and staging the data. This tool exfiltrates specified files to cloud storage web services, including Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.

Given this information, it is likely that the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services after identifying target systems and data of interest, rather than before copying results of the discovery phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities to identify target systems and data of interest.
2. The adversary then uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data, which is a separate step from the discovery phase.
3. The custom-built tool exfiltrates data to cloud storage web services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the adversary will exfiltrate data using cloud storage web services after identifying target systems and data of interest.

**Final Answer: B**
