**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the cyberespionage group FamousSparrow. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Resource Development**: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
2. **Initial Access**: Gaining access by exploiting the same vulnerabilities used for Resource Development.
3. **Execution**: Utilizing cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor, and exploiting the same vulnerabilities for Execution.
4. **Persistence**: Creating a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installing it as a service, and using DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Injecting the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusting token privileges to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, and obfuscating files or information.
6. **Credential Access**: Using a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials from compromised systems.
7. **Discovery**: Collecting system information, probing files, and obtaining their names, attributes, sizes, and last modified times.
8. **Collection**: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
9. **Command and Control**: Communicating with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications with different multi-byte XOR keys.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the likelihood of FamousSparrow exfiltrating data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server using the HTTPS protocol and performing encrypted communications employing multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the likelihood of exfiltrating data to the C2 server using a scheduled transfer method. The CTI outline mentions that FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access and that they employed Defense Evasion tactics, including obfuscating files or information. However, it does not provide specific details on the timing or method of data exfiltration.

The CTI outline does mention that FamousSparrow used the HTTPS protocol for Command and Control and employed multi-byte XOR keys for encrypted communications. However, it does not provide information on the frequency or method of data exfiltration.

Given the information provided, we can infer that FamousSparrow likely used the HTTPS protocol and multi-byte XOR keys for Command and Control, but we cannot determine the likelihood of exfiltrating data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, we cannot determine the likelihood of exfiltrating data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method. The CTI outline does not provide specific details on the timing or method of data exfiltration. Therefore, we cannot conclude that FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

However, since the question asks for a binary answer (Yes or No), and we cannot confirm the likelihood of the specific action, we must choose the answer that is most conservative based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: B**
