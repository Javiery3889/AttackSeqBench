**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros are sent to victims.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro executes, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk, and uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention anything about exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The attack sequence described in the CTI outline involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros, which execute a PowerShell script to download and execute payloads. There is no mention of exploiting a specific vulnerability like CVE-2018-13379.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not involve exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices. The question asks about the likelihood of exploiting this vulnerability, but the CTI outline does not provide any information about it. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is unlikely that the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices.

Final Answer: B
