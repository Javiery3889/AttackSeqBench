**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities.
2. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing an elevation of privilege exploit fine-tuned against the latest builds of Windows 10, exploiting two distinct vulnerabilities in the Windows OS kernel (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956).

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after downloading and executing a malware Dropper module to further the attack. The question specifically asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access and privilege escalation phases. The CTI outline does not provide information about the Stager module or its behavior after the initial access and privilege escalation phases. However, it does mention that the attackers used a malware Dropper module to further the attack.

Given the information provided, we can infer that the Stager module is likely part of the malware Dropper module, and its purpose is to further the attack after initial access and privilege escalation. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the Stager module's behavior or whether it notifies of successful exploitation.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, we cannot determine the exact behavior of the Stager module or whether it notifies of successful exploitation. However, we can infer that the Stager module is likely part of the malware Dropper module and is used to further the attack after initial access and privilege escalation.

Since the CTI outline does not provide information about the Stager module's behavior, we cannot definitively answer the question. However, based on the information provided, we can eliminate answer choice B, which states "No", as it implies that the Stager module does not notify of successful exploitation after initial access and privilege escalation.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is A: Yes, as it implies that the Stager module does notify of successful exploitation after initial access and privilege escalation.

**Final Answer: A**
