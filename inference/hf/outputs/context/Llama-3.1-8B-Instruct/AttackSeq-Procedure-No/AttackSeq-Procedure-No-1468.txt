**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, install BlackEnergy 3 on employee workstations, and gain access to the corporate network.
3. Execution: Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
4. Credential Access: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log keystrokes, and access the domain controller.
5. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled CC server.
6. Impact: Adversaries develop malicious computer code updates for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.
7. Impact: Adversaries deliver data destruction malware (KillDisk) to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve and execute the malware upon system reboot.
8. Impact: Adversaries schedule an unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers.
9. Impact: Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers.
10. Impact: Adversaries deliver malicious computer code updates to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices, rendering the converters inoperable and severing connections between the control center and the substations.
11. Impact: Adversaries initiate a DoS attack on the telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors.
12. Impact: Adversaries disable critical systems via UPS outage, cutting power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers.
13. Impact: Adversaries destroy critical system data by executing KillDisk malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after credential harvesting using delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins for expanding access across the corporate network, adversaries will extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and then perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before developing a malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the extraction of Wi-Fi network names or a brute-force attack to spread to new networks. However, it does mention that after credential harvesting, adversaries use the stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new privileged accounts (Step 7: Credential Access). This suggests that the adversaries are expanding their access across the corporate network, but there is no indication of a brute-force attack on Wi-Fi networks.

The CTI outline also mentions that adversaries develop malicious computer code updates for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters (Step 6: Impact), which is the step that comes after credential harvesting.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of events is:

1. Credential harvesting using delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins for expanding access across the corporate network.
2. Developing a malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.

The question asks if the adversaries will extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and then perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before developing a malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters. Since the CTI outline does not mention the extraction of Wi-Fi network names or a brute-force attack, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
