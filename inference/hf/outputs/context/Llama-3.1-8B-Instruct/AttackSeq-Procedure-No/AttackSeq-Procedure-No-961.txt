**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack by the Lazarus Group on a pharmaceutical company. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attackers delivered malicious documents containing job offers to company employees, which activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
2. Initial Access: Employees opened the malicious documents, which contained job offers, and activated malicious macros on their home computers.
3. Execution: The attackers executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
4. Persistence: The attackers created services using the sc.exe utility and local administrator accounts for persistence.
5. Privilege Escalation: The attackers escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
6. Defense Evasion: The attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files with the VEST algorithm and hiding malware in hidden folders.
7. Discovery: The attackers collected information about users, network settings, and processes using system utilities like net user, adfind, tasklist.exe, and systeminfo.exe.
8. Lateral Movement: The attackers used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains using the HTTP protocol only before moving laterally.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with the C2 servers, but it does not specifically mention the use of the HTTP protocol. However, it does mention that the attackers used the SMBMap utility to discover shared folders within the network, which suggests that they may have used SMB (Server Message Block) protocol for communication.

Given the context of the attack, it is likely that the attackers used a combination of protocols for communication, including their own data encryption algorithm and potentially SMB protocol. However, the question specifically asks about the use of the HTTP protocol only.

Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that the attackers would use only the HTTP protocol for communication with C2 servers, especially since they used their own data encryption algorithm and potentially SMB protocol for communication.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, which includes reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, discovery, and lateral movement.
2. The question asks about the use of the HTTP protocol for communication with C2 servers before moving laterally.
3. The CTI outline mentions the use of the SMBMap utility, which suggests the use of SMB protocol for communication.
4. The attackers used their own data encryption algorithm for communication, which is not specified as HTTP.
5. Based on the context, it is unlikely that the attackers would use only the HTTP protocol for communication with C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B**
