**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Turla group, a sophisticated threat actor. The attack sequence can be broken down into the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. **Execution**: Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory, bypassing detection mechanisms.
2. **Persistence**: Turla employs two methods for persistence: using WMI event subscriptions and modifying the PowerShell profile.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Turla's PowerShell scripts evade detection by encrypting payloads, obfuscating scripts, and patching the AmsiScanBuffer function.
4. **Discovery**: Turla uses RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor for lateral movement and control of machines within a local network.
5. **Collection**: Turla's RPC backdoor plugins collect files from the local file system and USB drives, while PowerStallion uses OneDrive as a command and control server.
6. **Command and Control**: The RPC backdoor uses the RPC protocol, while PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive via SMB.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS after utilizing the RPC protocol and Microsoft OneDrive as command and control channels.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the **Command and Control** tactic, specifically the use of Microsoft OneDrive as a command and control server by PowerStallion. The CTI outline states that PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control. There is no mention of HTTPS being used for exfiltration.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, PowerStallion uses OneDrive via SMB for command and control, but there is no indication that it uses HTTPS for exfiltration. Therefore, it is unlikely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS.

Final Answer: B
