To answer this question, let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, social media data collection, and analysis for future targeting.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, and employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros, allowing the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) malware.
3. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled Command-and-Control (C2) server.
4. Credential Access: Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
5. Discovery: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand access.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that the attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information and conduct active discovery methods.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign, and employees open weaponized email attachments and enable macros, allowing the installation of BE3 malware.
3. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server **after** being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

Therefore, the correct answer is that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers **after** being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
2. The attack sequence is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Command and Control, Credential Access, and Discovery.
3. The question asks whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.
4. Based on the CTI outline, the correct answer is that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers **after** being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Final Answer: B**
