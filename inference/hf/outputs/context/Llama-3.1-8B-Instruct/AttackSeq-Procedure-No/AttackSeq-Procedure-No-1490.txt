**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically targeting Ukrainian power facilities using BlackEnergy 3 malware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager (CVE-2014-4114) to infect Excel documents.
2. Execution: Executing a Visual Basic macro embedded in the Excel document, which reassembles and executes a portable executable (PE32) named vba_macro.exe.
3. Execution: vba_macro.exe drops two additional executables, FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, and then deletes itself.
4. Persistence: Registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function for persistence.
5. Defense Evasion: Using anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt() function calls, SetUnhandledExceptionFilter API, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent API.
6. Lateral Movement: Sending data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe.
7. Command and Control: Communicating with the command and control (C2) server using HTTP protocol.
8. Exfiltration: Sending gathered information to the C2 server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3 will use the open-source port scanner WinEggDrop to perform detailed scans of hosts of interest in victim networks before sending this information to command and control servers located in European ISPs.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention the use of WinEggDrop in the attack sequence. However, it does mention that BlackEnergy 3 malware is designed for lateral movement, sending data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe. This suggests that the malware may perform some form of network scanning or reconnaissance to gather information about the victim network.

However, the CTI outline does not specifically mention the use of WinEggDrop. The question asks about the use of WinEggDrop, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, we can infer that BlackEnergy 3 malware is designed for lateral movement and sends data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe. However, the specific tool used for this purpose is not mentioned. Since WinEggDrop is not mentioned in the CTI outline, we cannot confirm its use in the attack sequence.

However, considering the context of the question, it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 malware would perform some form of network scanning or reconnaissance to gather information about the victim network before sending this information to command and control servers. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that BlackEnergy 3 will use some form of network scanning, but we cannot confirm the use of WinEggDrop specifically.

**Final Answer: B**
