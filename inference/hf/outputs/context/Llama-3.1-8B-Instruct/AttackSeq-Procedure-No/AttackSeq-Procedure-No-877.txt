**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Naikon APT group. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The group used various methods to gain initial access, including a weaponized RTF file, archive files, and direct delivery via an executable file.
2. Execution: The Aria-body loader was used to establish persistence, inject itself into processes, decrypt configuration data, contact C&C servers, and load the Aria-body backdoor.
3. Persistence: The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
4. Defense Evasion: The group used various techniques to evade detection, including limited daily windows for C&C servers, fileless loading, and changing server infrastructure and loader variants.
5. Discovery: The Aria-body backdoor gathered information from the victim's machine, including system and network information.
6. Collection: The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, and gather additional information.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the group's behavior is as follows:

* During the Discovery tactic, the Aria-body backdoor gathers system and network information.
* After gathering this information, the group uses the collected data for further actions, including sending it to C&C servers and listening for additional commands.

The question asks about the use of HTTP and TCP protocols before the Discovery tactic. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the group's use of these protocols before the Discovery tactic. Instead, it mentions that the group uses these protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands after the Discovery tactic.

Given this information, the correct answer is that the group is not likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
