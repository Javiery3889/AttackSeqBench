**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the OceanLotus group (APT32) in their attacks. The key points are:

1. Initial Access: The group uses two methods to deliver KerrDown:
   - Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros
   - RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading
2. Defense Evasion: The actors reuse a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs.
3. Command and Control: The final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

From the CTI outline, we know that the actors reuse a VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs. This is a defense evasion technique used by the group. However, the question specifically asks about the Office document using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the Office document using base64 blobs for this purpose.

However, it does mention that the KerrDown DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using the DES algorithm, and executes it in memory. This suggests that the payload is executed in memory, but it does not directly address the question.

The question also mentions the Office document containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. This is a social engineering technique used to trick the victim into enabling macros, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is likely that the Office document will use social engineering to trick the victim into enabling macros, rather than using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Deliver KerrDown to targets via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading.
2. The Office document uses social engineering to trick the victim into enabling macros.
3. The macros execute the malicious payload.

The answer choice that aligns best with this sequence is:

**Final Answer: B**
