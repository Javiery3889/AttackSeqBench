**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by GreyEnergy, a threat actor linked to the BlackEnergy and TeleBots subgroups. The outline covers various MITRE ATT&CK tactics, including:

1. Resource Development: GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted victim systems.
2. Initial Access: GreyEnergy has used spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers as infection vectors.
3. Persistence: GreyEnergy's operators securely wipe the malware components from the victims' hard drives to cover their tracks.
4. Defense Evasion: GreyEnergy employs stealth techniques, including partial encryption of modules using AES-256 and running some modules fileless in memory.
5. Credential Access: GreyEnergy operators use common external tools such as Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner for credential access.
6. Lateral Movement: GreyEnergy attackers deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server on the internet.
7. Command and Control: GreyEnergy's internal C&C proxies redirect requests from infected nodes inside the network to an external C&C server on the internet.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework during resource development with functionality defined by uploaded modules to targeted systems after securing access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly references the Resource Development tactic, which is described in the CTI outline as a key aspect of GreyEnergy's malware framework. The outline states that GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted victim systems.

Given this information, the correct answer is likely to be affirmative, as GreyEnergy's malware framework is designed to be modular and dependent on uploaded modules.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question specifically asks about GreyEnergy's use of a modular malware framework during resource development.
2. The CTI outline describes GreyEnergy's malware framework as modular, with functionality dependent on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted victim systems.
3. This information directly supports the idea that GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework during resource development.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be affirmative.

**Final Answer: A**
