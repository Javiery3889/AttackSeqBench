**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of Mustang Panda's campaign using the Korplug variant. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks using filenames related to current events.
2. Execution: A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable to execute the Korplug variant.
3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a directory under %allusersprofile% and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry to run at boot.
4. Defense Evasion: Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques at every stage of the deployment process.
5. Discovery: Korplug collects extensive information about the system, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.
6. Collection: Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
7. Command and Control: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Mustang Panda's Korplug variant is likely to perform data discovery on the system after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions data exfiltration over TCP, which is related to the Command and Control (C2) phase of the attack. The CTI outline mentions that Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives during the Collection phase, which is after the Discovery phase. The Discovery phase is where Korplug collects information about the system, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.

Given the sequence of events, it is likely that after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, Korplug will perform data discovery on the system, including collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about data discovery after data exfiltration over TCP, which is related to the C2 phase.
2. The CTI outline mentions that Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives during the Collection phase, which is after the Discovery phase.
3. The Discovery phase is where Korplug collects information about the system, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.
4. Therefore, it is likely that after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP, Korplug will perform data discovery on the system, including collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

**Final Answer: A**
