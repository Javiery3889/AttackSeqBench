**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the phases of a cyber attack in the order they occur:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after attackers install additional persistence points on new systems. The question specifically asks if attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

From the CTI outline, we can see that the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

The question specifically asks about the sequence after installing additional persistence points on new systems, which corresponds to the Persistence phase. The next phase after Persistence is Privilege Escalation, not Discovery.

However, the question asks about lateral movement, which is more closely related to the Execution and Privilege Escalation phases. The question also mentions exploiting remote services, which is a tactic used in the Execution phase.

Given the context of the question, it seems to be asking about the sequence of TTPs after Persistence, but the question is not directly asking about the next phase after Persistence. Instead, it's asking about lateral movement, which is a broader concept that can occur in multiple phases.

Considering the answer choices, A: Yes seems to be the most plausible answer. After installing additional persistence points on new systems, attackers would likely want to gain knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the Discovery phase before exploiting remote services to achieve lateral movement.

However, the question is not directly asking about the next phase after Persistence, but rather about the sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement. The correct answer should be based on the sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement, which is more closely related to the Execution and Privilege Escalation phases.

Given the context of the question, it seems that the question is asking about the sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement, which is not directly answered by the CTI outline. However, based on the information provided, the most plausible answer is A: Yes, as it is the most likely sequence of TTPs related to lateral movement.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
