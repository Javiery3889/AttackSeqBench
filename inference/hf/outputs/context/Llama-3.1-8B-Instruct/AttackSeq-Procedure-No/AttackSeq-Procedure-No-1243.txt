**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT28, a threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Scanning for new targets, particularly in Ukraine and Spain.
2. Initial Access: Employing spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents, phishing websites on typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits to infect targets.
3. Execution: The first stage of the attack involves a dropper named runrun.exe, which drops and executes a file to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
4. Execution: The second stage component, installed by a dropper named winloat.exe, writes key components to the disk along with a configuration file and takes control of the machine.
5. Persistence: Changing the timestamps of all files downloaded by the second stage dropper to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
6. Privilege Escalation: Using a tool exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2014-4076) to gain system privileges.
7. Defense Evasion: Changing file timestamps and using a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers.
8. Credential Access: Deploying a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on the mimikatz source.
9. Collection: Deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
10. Command and Control: Communicating with the C&C server via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption using 3DES and RSA.
11. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data such as emails and files to the central server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process only before executing a dropper to enable system compromise.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the scanning process involved a python script generating random IPs, a database centralizing data, scan bots probing potential victims, and a Django application for administration and reporting. The bots are geographically distributed across the United States, United Kingdom, and Bulgaria. This indicates that APT28 does use geographically distributed bots during the reconnaissance phase to scan for potential targets.

However, the question specifically asks about the discovery process before executing a dropper to enable system compromise. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of geographically distributed bots after the initial access phase. Instead, it describes the use of bots during the reconnaissance phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, APT28 uses geographically distributed bots during the reconnaissance phase to scan for potential targets. However, the question asks about the discovery process before executing a dropper to enable system compromise, which is part of the initial access phase. The CTI outline does not provide information about the use of geographically distributed bots during this specific phase.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
