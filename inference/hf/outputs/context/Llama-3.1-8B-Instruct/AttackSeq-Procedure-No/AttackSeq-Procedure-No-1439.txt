**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the StellarParticle campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the following order:

1. Initial Access:
   - Logging into a public-facing system via SSH using a local account acquired during previous credential theft activities.
   - Establishing a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session to internal servers using different domain accounts.
   - Using VPNs to gain access to systems and persist in the environment.
   - Exporting saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations.

2. Persistence:
   - Credential hopping using different credentials for each step while moving laterally through the victim's network.
   - Using accounts with Delegated Administrator rights to access other O365 tenants and create persistence within the environment.
   - Configuring TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
   - Configuring GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
   - Adding credentials to O365 Service Principals and creating new O365 Service Principals to maintain access to victim's environments.

3. Defense Evasion:
   - Stealing browser cookies to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA).
   - Renaming utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
   - Renaming systems prior to connecting to victim's VPNs to match the victim's system naming convention.

4. Discovery:
   - Using AdFind, standard PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify various pieces of information from Active Directory.
   - Regularly interrogating other systems using tasklist.exe and probing external services in an attempt to regain access to the environment.

5. Lateral Movement:
   - Using both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment, depending on the target system.

6. Collection:
   - Accessing data from Information Repositories.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of stealing web session cookies and utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence. The CTI outline shows that the campaign used credential hopping (Persistence) and configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence (Persistence) before stealing browser cookies (Defense Evasion) to bypass MFA.

Based on the order of events in the CTI outline, it is likely that the campaign will steal web session cookies after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The campaign used credential hopping (Persistence) to move laterally through the network.
2. They configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence (Persistence) to maintain access to the environment.
3. After establishing persistence, the campaign used stolen browser cookies (Defense Evasion) to bypass MFA.

The question asks if the campaign will steal web session cookies after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence. The correct sequence of events matches the order in which the campaign used credential hopping and configured malware for WMI persistence before stealing browser cookies.

**Final Answer: A**
