**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Execution (using JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying)
4. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR)
5. Privilege Escalation (utilizing common privilege escalation techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks)
6. Defense Evasion (employing defense evasion tactics such as using passive backdoors for stealth, chaining web shells for complex pivots, and leveraging legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion)
7. Credential Access (using techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials)
8. Lateral Movement (using WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, FIN13 uses various techniques for credential access, including process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials. After obtaining credentials, they use WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally. This suggests that credential access is a precursor to lateral movement.

The question asks if FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials. Given the attack sequence, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery as part of their lateral movement phase, after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
