**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CosmicDuke malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware deceives victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute its code.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence on the system by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials.
5. Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
6. Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.
7. Exfiltration: The information collected by the malware is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the configuration, which includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1. However, it does not mention the use of the LZW algorithm. The question specifically asks about the LZW algorithm, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke uses the LZW algorithm for compressing output data. The CTI outline mentions a different algorithm (LZNT-1) for compressing the configuration, but not for compressing output data.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline does not mention the LZW algorithm in relation to CosmicDuke's TTPs.
2. The CTI outline mentions a different algorithm (LZNT-1) for compressing the configuration, but not for compressing output data.
3. Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke uses the LZW algorithm for compressing output data.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
