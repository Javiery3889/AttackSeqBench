**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sequence of attack tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by an APT group, likely behind 'Operation Transparent Tribe'. The sequence is as follows:

1. Execution: The malicious document contained macro code which executed to drop the first payload, a Crimson RAT downloader.
2. Execution: The first payload then downloaded a fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246.
3. Persistence: The first payload downloaded the fully functional Crimson RAT and dropped it to the path 'C:\ProgramData\Hurmz\bahgrtmrs.exe'.
4. Defense Evasion: The payload had the capability to kill any process running in the system using specific code.
5. Credential Access: The Crimson RAT had functionalities for keylogging and browser credential theft.
6. Command and Control: The payload received commands from the C&C server and supported various commands.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files. However, it does mention a spear phishing campaign targeting officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. This suggests that the attackers may use a targeted phishing campaign to deliver the malicious document containing the macro code.

The question asks about delivering malicious files via social media channels, but the CTI outline does not provide information about this specific tactic. However, the fact that the attackers used a spear phishing campaign to target officials suggests that they may use other tactics to deliver the malicious files, such as email or social engineering.

The question also mentions downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address, which is consistent with the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, it is likely that the attackers used a spear phishing campaign to deliver the malicious document containing the macro code. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively answer the question with a "Yes" or "No" based on the CTI outline alone. However, considering the context of the question and the fact that the attackers used a spear phishing campaign, it is possible that they may use other tactics to deliver the malicious files, including social media channels.

However, since the question is asking about the likelihood of using social media channels to deliver malicious files, and the CTI outline does not provide information about this specific tactic, the most conservative answer would be to say that it is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.
