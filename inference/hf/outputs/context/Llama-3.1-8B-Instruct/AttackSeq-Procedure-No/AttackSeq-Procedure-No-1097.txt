**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CosmicDuke malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware deceives victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute its payload.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence on the system by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials, including Windows credentials, software credentials, and certificates.
5. Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
6. Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.
7. Exfiltration: The malware exfiltrates the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by CosmicDuke after exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP. The question specifically asks if the malware is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs described in the question does not match the actual sequence used by CosmicDuke. The CTI outline does not mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer as part of the malware's TTPs. Additionally, the question's condition about searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

However, the question's focus on the sequence of TTPs after exfiltration is relevant to the CTI outline, which mentions that the malware uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data. This suggests that the question is asking about the malware's behavior after exfiltration, which is not explicitly described in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct sequence of TTPs used by CosmicDuke after exfiltration based on the CTI outline. However, since the question asks about the likelihood of using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, which are not mentioned in the CTI outline, the correct answer is likely to be "No", as these TTPs are not described in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the TTPs used by CosmicDuke, but it does not mention the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, or clipboard stealer.
2. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by CosmicDuke after exfiltration, which is not explicitly described in the CTI outline.
3. Since the question's condition about searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection is not mentioned in the CTI outline, it is not relevant to the malware's behavior.
4. Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct sequence of TTPs used by CosmicDuke after exfiltration.
5. However, since the question asks about the likelihood of using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer, which are not mentioned in the CTI outline, the correct answer is likely to be "No".

**Final Answer: B**
