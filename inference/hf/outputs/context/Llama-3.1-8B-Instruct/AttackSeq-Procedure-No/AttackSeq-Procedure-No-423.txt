**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The campaign's goal is to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware upon successful execution. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to the target systems.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Defense Evasion**: A PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of events following the initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document. The CTI outline indicates that the PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk, and would communicate with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads. The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

Based on this information, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were used to gain initial access to the target systems.
2. The macro executed a PowerShell script that operated in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
3. The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads.
4. The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

Given this sequence of events, it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script will execute only before being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Final Answer: A**
