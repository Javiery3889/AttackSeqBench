**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Waterbear campaign, associated with the BlackTech cyberespionage group. The attack sequence involves:

1. Execution:
   - A malicious DLL loader is used to decrypt and execute a first-stage backdoor.
   - The backdoor can receive and load additional executables from external attackers.
   - The infection begins with a malicious DLL loader, which can be triggered by modifying a legitimate server application to import the malicious DLL or through phantom DLL hijacking and DLL side-loading.
   - The loader searches for a hardcoded path to decrypt the payload, which is then injected into an existing Windows Service, such as LanmanServer, run by svchost.exe.

2. Defense Evasion:
   - Waterbear uses API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific security product.
   - The malware injects code into the security product to hide its network behaviors.
   - The payload uses API hooking to modify the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory, thus avoiding detection while the original system DLL files remain unchanged.

3. Others:
   - The Waterbear campaign targets technology companies and government agencies in East Asia, specifically Taiwan, and sometimes Japan and Hong Kong.
   - The attackers demonstrate knowledge of the victims' environments and security products, indicating a high level of familiarity with their targets.
   - The API hooking shellcode is generic and could potentially be used to target other security products in the future, making Waterbear harder to detect.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that API hooking techniques will be used to evade detection by modifying functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory after Waterbear's backdoor configuration includes an encryption/decryption key and XOR-encrypted C&C server address for its communication with external entities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly asks about the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection, which is mentioned in the Defense Evasion section of the CTI outline. The specific functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' are also mentioned in the CTI outline as being modified by the API hooking technique.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, it is clear that Waterbear uses API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific security product. The question specifically asks about the use of API hooking techniques to evade detection by modifying the functions 'ZwOpenProcess' and 'GetExtendedTcpTable' in memory. This is a direct match with the information provided in the CTI outline.

Therefore, the answer to the question is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
