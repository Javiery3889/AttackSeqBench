**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
2. Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices but not on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after collecting information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase, the malware will initiate a download via FTP as part of the Command and Control (C2) phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of actions after the Discovery phase. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the Command and Control phase, but we can infer the sequence of actions based on the provided information.

The Discovery phase involves collecting sensitive information from the device. After collecting this information, the next logical step would be to send this data back to the attacker for further analysis or to receive additional instructions. However, the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for this purpose.

Given the lack of information about the Command and Control phase in the CTI outline, we cannot directly confirm whether the malware initiates a download via FTP. However, we can infer that the malware likely needs to communicate with the attacker to send the collected data or receive further instructions.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the provided information, we cannot confirm the use of FTP for the Command and Control phase. The CTI outline does not provide enough context to determine whether the malware initiates a download via FTP after collecting information during the Discovery phase.

However, considering the typical behavior of malware, it is likely that the malware will need to communicate with the attacker to send the collected data or receive further instructions. Since the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the Command and Control phase, we cannot definitively choose answer choice A.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical behavior of malware, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
