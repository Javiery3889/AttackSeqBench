**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics attributed to the Chinese APT group Deep Panda. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Resource Development: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
2. Initial Access: Exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability allowed them to gain initial access.
3. Execution: The attack chain involved the execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
4. Persistence: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
5. Privilege Escalation: The 2016 version of the Milestone backdoor creates a new administrator user and executes another instance of itself.
6. Discovery: The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
7. Command and Control: The Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server.
8. Exfiltration: The Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities after ensuring persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the installation of a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. However, it does mention that Deep Panda used a stolen digital certificate, also utilized by another Chinese APT group, Winnti, to sign their tools. This suggests that Deep Panda may have used a certificate for signing their tools, but it does not necessarily imply that they would install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store.

Given the context of the attack sequence, it is more likely that Deep Panda would proceed with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities after ensuring persistence, rather than installing a self-generated certificate.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Deep Panda would proceed with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities after ensuring persistence, rather than installing a self-generated certificate.

Final Answer: B
