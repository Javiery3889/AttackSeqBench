**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Longhorn group, a threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets.
2. Discovery: Longhorn's malware performs system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
3. Command and Control: Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
4. Exfiltration: Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after Longhorn performs detailed system fingerprinting for discovery, their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before gaining initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after system fingerprinting, but the provided CTI outline does not mention the Vault 7 documents or any guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. However, it does mention that Longhorn's malware uses operational security measures to remain undetected, and they operate with a high degree of operational security.

The question also mentions exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware, which is mentioned in the CTI outline as a method used by Longhorn for initial access.

However, the question is asking about the sequence of TTPs after system fingerprinting, and the CTI outline does not provide information on what happens after system fingerprinting. The CTI outline does not mention the Vault 7 documents or any guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to determine the correct sequence of TTPs after system fingerprinting. However, we can infer that Longhorn's malware is designed to remain undetected and that they operate with a high degree of operational security.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, we cannot determine the correct sequence of TTPs after system fingerprinting. However, we can infer that Longhorn's malware is designed to remain undetected and that they operate with a high degree of operational security.

Since the question asks if their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents, and the CTI outline does not mention the Vault 7 documents or any guidelines on tactics to avoid detection, we cannot confirm that Longhorn's tools will follow these guidelines.

However, considering the context of the question and the information provided, the most plausible answer is that Longhorn's tools will not follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents, as the CTI outline does not mention these guidelines.

**Final Answer: B**
