**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the behavior of the FoggyWeb backdoor used by NOBELIUM. The key points are:

- FoggyWeb is a persistent backdoor that can exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised AD FS servers.
- It receives and executes additional malicious components from a C2 server.
- It drops two files on the system with administrative privileges: %WinDir%\ADFS\version.dll and %WinDir%\SystemResources\Windows.Data.TimeZones\pris\Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri.
- The version.dll acts as a loader for the encrypted FoggyWeb backdoor, which is stored in the Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri file.
- FoggyWeb operates by leveraging CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load the backdoor within the same Application Domain as the legitimate AD FS managed code.
- It configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic the structure of legitimate URIs used by the target's AD FS deployment.
- It passively monitors incoming HTTP GET and POST requests and intercepts those matching the actor's custom URI patterns.
- It can retrieve the token signing certificate, token decryption certificate, and AD FS configuration data of the compromised server, obfuscate the data, and return it to the issuer of the request.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if FoggyWeb is likely to passively monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns only after exfiltrating the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, FoggyWeb configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs and passively monitors incoming HTTP GET and POST requests and intercepts those matching the actor's custom URI patterns. However, it does not explicitly state that it exfiltrates the configuration database, decrypted token-signing certificates, and token-decryption certificates before monitoring HTTP requests.

However, it does mention that it can retrieve the token signing certificate, token decryption certificate, and AD FS configuration data of the compromised server, obfuscate the data, and return it to the issuer of the request. This implies that it can access and retrieve sensitive information, including certificates and configuration data, before or while monitoring HTTP requests.

Given the information, it is likely that FoggyWeb can monitor HTTP GET and POST requests for actor-defined custom URI patterns after accessing and retrieving sensitive information, including configuration data and certificates.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
