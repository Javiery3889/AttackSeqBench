**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Duke group, a threat actor. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: The Duke group uses Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to compromise high-profile government networks.
2. Defense Evasion: Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, is used to hide behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
3. Credential Access: The Duke group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell) and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials.
4. Collection: Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and securely delete the malware from the system using a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.
5. Exfiltration: The Duke group uses Seaduke to archive sensitive information and exfiltrate data via legitimate cloud services.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Seaduke will calculate the command-and-control port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value after utilizing Seaduke to retrieve detailed bot/system information and securely delete itself using a 'seppuku' function.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Collection phase of the attack, specifically the actions taken by Seaduke after it has compromised the system. The question mentions two specific actions: retrieving detailed bot/system information and securely deleting itself using a 'seppuku' function. However, there is no mention of calculating the command-and-control port in the provided CTI outline.

The CTI outline does mention that Seaduke's communication protocol employs many layers of encryption and obfuscation, using over 200 compromised web servers for command and control. However, it does not provide information on how Seaduke calculates the command-and-control port.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to suggest that Seaduke calculates the command-and-control port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value. The CTI outline does not mention this specific technique, and the question does not provide enough context to support this claim.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
