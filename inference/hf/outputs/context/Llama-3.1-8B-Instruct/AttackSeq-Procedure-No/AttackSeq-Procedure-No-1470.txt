To answer this question, let's analyze the CTI outline and the question step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, social media data collection, and analysis for future targeting.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, and employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros, allowing the installation of BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) malware.
3. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled CC server.
4. Credential Access: Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
5. Discovery: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand access.
6. Impact: Adversaries develop malicious computer code updates for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.
7. Impact: Adversaries deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve and execute the malware upon system reboot.
8. Impact: Adversaries schedule unauthorized outages of UPS devices for telephone communication servers and data center servers.
9. Impact: Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers.
10. Impact: Adversaries deliver malicious computer code updates to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices, rendering them inoperable and severing connections between the control center and substations.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) malware is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution (Step 3: Initial Access). However, there is no mention of Ruby scripts being used to execute payloads. Instead, the CTI outline mentions that the malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests (Step 5: Establish CC Connection).

Therefore, it is unlikely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
2. The attack sequence involves reconnaissance, initial access, command and control, credential access, discovery, and impact.
3. BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) malware is installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution (Step 3: Initial Access).
4. There is no mention of Ruby scripts being used to execute payloads in the CTI outline.
5. The CTI outline mentions that the malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests (Step 5: Establish CC Connection).
6. Therefore, it is unlikely that BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network.

**Final Answer: B**
