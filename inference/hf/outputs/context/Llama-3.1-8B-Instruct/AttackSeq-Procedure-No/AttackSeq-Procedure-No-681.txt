**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. **Initial Access**: Attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
2. **Resource Development**: Attackers used the compromised Docker API to disseminate and communicate with Kinsing malware, and also used compromised websites to store malicious files downloaded during container runtime.
3. **Execution**: Attackers abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
4. **Persistence**: Adversaries used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow and gain persistency.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Adversaries removed security software to avoid detection.
7. **Credential Access**: Adversaries used open-source tools to collect credentials.
8. **Command and Control**: Attackers used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
9. **Exfiltration**: Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials over the C2 server was observed.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the detection of compromised Docker APIs after deploying malicious containers. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of DOCKERGEDDON or the detection of compromised Docker APIs. However, it does mention that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access, and later used the compromised Docker API to disseminate and communicate with Kinsing malware.

Given the context, it is likely that the attackers would not detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers. Instead, the attackers would likely use the compromised Docker API to deploy malicious containers, which would then be detected by tools like DOCKERGEDDON.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question is asking about the detection of compromised Docker APIs after deploying malicious containers.
2. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of DOCKERGEDDON or the detection of compromised Docker APIs.
3. However, it is likely that the attackers would use the compromised Docker API to deploy malicious containers, which would then be detected by tools like DOCKERGEDDON.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

**Final Answer: B**
