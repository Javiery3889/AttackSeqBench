**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, social media data collection and analysis for future targeting.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, and install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
3. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled C2 server.
4. Credential Access: Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
5. Discovery: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand accessed.
6. Impact: Adversaries develop malicious computer code update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.
7. Impact: Adversaries deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot.
8. Impact: Adversaries schedule unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers.
9. Impact: Adversaries use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers within three distribution areas.
10. Impact: Adversaries deliver malicious computer code update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices, rendering the converters inoperable, and sever connections between the control center and the substations.
11. Impact: Adversaries initiate a DoS attack on the telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors.
12. Impact: Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers.
13. Impact: Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims' corporate and ICS network.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after establishing a Command and Control (C2) connection through malicious VBA script execution, it is likely that the adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly state that a phishing campaign is performed after establishing a C2 connection. However, it does mention that the Initial Access step involves a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems. The Command and Control step is mentioned after the Initial Access step, which suggests that the C2 connection is established after the RAT is delivered to the target systems.

Given this sequence, it is unlikely that a phishing campaign would be performed after establishing a C2 connection, as the RAT has already been delivered to the target systems.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
2. The attack sequence is as follows: Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Command and Control, Credential Access, Discovery, Impact, Impact, Impact, Impact, Impact, Impact, Impact, Impact, and Impact.
3. The question asks if, after establishing a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution, it is likely that the adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems.
4. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that a phishing campaign is performed after establishing a C2 connection.
5. The Initial Access step involves a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems, and the Command and Control step is mentioned after the Initial Access step.
6. Therefore, it is unlikely that a phishing campaign would be performed after establishing a C2 connection.

**Final Answer: B**
