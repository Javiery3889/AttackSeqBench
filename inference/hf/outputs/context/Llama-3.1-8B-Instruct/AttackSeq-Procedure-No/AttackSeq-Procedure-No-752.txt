**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Operation Sharpshooter campaign, which involves a series of tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by the threat actor. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The threat actor gathers information for potential exploitation by masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity.
2. Initial Access: The threat actor distributes malicious documents via an IP address in the United States and through Dropbox, which contain a malicious macro that injects the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
3. Execution: The shellcode executed by the macro in winword.exe acts as a downloader for the Rising Sun implant, resolving Libraries and APIs, downloading the second-stage payload, and executing both payloads.
4. Persistence: The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence on the system by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process.
5. Command and Control: The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, sending data in various formats encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
6. Exfiltration: The Rising Sun implant encrypts data using the RC4 stream encryption algorithm and obfuscates it with Base64 encoding before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the Rising Sun implant's capabilities include executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes. However, there is no explicit mention of collecting MAC addresses as part of its discovery activities.

Given the capabilities listed, it is unlikely that the Rising Sun implant would collect MAC addresses as part of its discovery activities. The implant's primary focus seems to be on executing commands, gathering system information, and communicating with control servers.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the Rising Sun implant's capabilities and the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that the implant would collect MAC addresses as part of its discovery activities.

Final Answer: B
