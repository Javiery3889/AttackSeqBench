**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the CostaRicto Campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the following order:

1. Initial Access: Stolen credentials were used to gain access to victims' environments. SSH tools were used for remote tunneling, and payload stagers were executed using scheduled tasks.
2. Execution: Malicious code was executed through various methods, including scripts, encrypted files, and a PowerShell loader.
3. Defense Evasion: Process injection and deobfuscation were used to evade detection.
4. Discovery: The SombRAT backdoor was used for process discovery, system information discovery, system time discovery, and network service scanning.
5. Collection: The SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
6. Command and Control: The SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA encryption for AES key exchange.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol after establishing communication with C2 servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, with SSL-encrypted traffic. However, it does not mention the use of HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration. In fact, the C2 protocol is specifically mentioned as being SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.

Given this information, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor would use a non-C2 protocol like HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration, as it has a dedicated C2 protocol in place.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the CostaRicto Campaign's TTPs, including initial access, execution, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and command and control.
2. The question asks about the likelihood of the SombRAT backdoor exfiltrating data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol.
3. The CTI outline does not mention the use of HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration, and instead describes a dedicated C2 protocol.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that the SombRAT backdoor would use a non-C2 protocol for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B**
