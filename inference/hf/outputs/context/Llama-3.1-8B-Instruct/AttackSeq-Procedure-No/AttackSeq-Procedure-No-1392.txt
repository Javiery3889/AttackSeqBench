**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor, a cybercriminal group targeting Mexico. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Discovery
8. Lateral Movement
9. Collection
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, FIN13's attack sequence involves:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information on the victim network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware.
2. Initial Access: Deploying web shells and custom malware to establish a foothold.
3. Execution: Using JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
4. Persistence: Using various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords.

The question asks about the sequence of retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module and gathering information on network and host configurations. This sequence is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but we can infer that FIN13's reconnaissance activities involve gathering information on network and host configurations.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, FIN13's reconnaissance activities involve gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware. The enum_secrets module is not mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is a tool that can be used for reconnaissance. However, the question asks about the sequence of events, and the CTI outline does not provide information on the specific order of events involving the enum_secrets module.

Given the information provided, it is not clear whether FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the enum_secrets module before gathering information on network and host configurations. However, based on the CTI outline, it is more likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware before retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
