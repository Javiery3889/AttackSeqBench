**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the CostaRicto Campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the following order:

1. Initial Access: Stolen credentials were used to gain access, followed by SSH tools for remote tunneling and payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) executed using scheduled tasks.
2. Execution: Malicious code was executed through various methods, including scripts, encrypted files, and a PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module) for the 64-bit backdoor, and a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks) for the 32-bit backdoor.
3. Defense Evasion: Process injection (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module) and deobfuscation were used to evade detection.
4. Discovery: The SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery, as well as network service scanning using tools like pscan and nmap.
5. Collection: The SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
6. Exfiltration: The SombRAT backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the SombRAT backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure to establish a Command and Control channel after performing process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Discovery phase, which is step 4 in the CTI outline. The question asks about the use of blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure, but the CTI outline does not mention this specific detail. However, it does mention the use of a C2 channel for exfiltration in step 6.

The CTI outline does not provide information about the specific C2 infrastructure used by the SombRAT backdoor. However, it does mention that the backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel, which implies that a C2 channel was established. The question does not provide enough information to determine the specific C2 infrastructure used.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we cannot determine the specific C2 infrastructure used by the SombRAT backdoor. The question asks about the use of blogs and WordPress, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the backdoor would use blogs and WordPress for C2 infrastructure.

However, since the question asks for a yes or no answer, and we cannot confirm the use of blogs and WordPress, we must choose the answer that is most likely based on the information provided.
