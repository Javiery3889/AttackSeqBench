**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Bandook campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The sequence of TTPs can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: A malicious Microsoft Word document is delivered inside a ZIP file.
2. Initial Access: The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
3. Initial Access: The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services like TinyURL or Bitly, which then redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker.
4. Initial Access: The VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data from the original document and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).
5. Defense Evasion: The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time.
6. Defense Evasion: The malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components.
7. Command and Control: The Bandook loader, written in Delphi, uses the Process Hollowing technique to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process.
8. Command and Control: The payload then contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and awaits further commands.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of a COM object to execute queries to gather system information. However, it does describe the VBA code within the external template decrypting the embedded data from the original document and dropping it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code). This suggests that the PowerShell script is involved in the initial stages of the attack.

The question specifically asks about the use of a COM object before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload. The CTI outline does not provide information about a COM object being used in this specific context.

However, the CTI outline does mention that the VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data from the original document, which implies that some form of script or code is executed before the PowerShell script is run. This could potentially involve a COM object, but the CTI outline does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine if a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload.

However, considering the sequence of TTPs described in the CTI outline, it is likely that some form of script or code is executed before the PowerShell script is run. Therefore, the most plausible answer choice would be:

**Final Answer: A**
