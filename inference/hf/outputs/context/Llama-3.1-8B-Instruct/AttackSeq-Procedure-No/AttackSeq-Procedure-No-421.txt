**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros are sent to victims.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro executes, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk, and uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically mentions the execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document, which is mentioned in the CTI outline as part of the **Execution** phase. The question also mentions gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file, which is consistent with the **Reconnaissance** phase described in the CTI outline.

Based on the attack sequence, it is clear that the VBS macros are executed after the phishing email is opened, which is part of the **Execution** phase. Therefore, the correct answer is that the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. The attack sequence starts with **Reconnaissance**, where phishing emails are sent to victims.
3. The question specifically asks about the execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document, which is part of the **Execution** phase.
4. The **Execution** phase occurs after the phishing email is opened, which is part of the **Reconnaissance** phase.
5. Therefore, the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

**Final Answer: B**
