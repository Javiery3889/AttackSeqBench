**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT15 in a cyber attack. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
2. Persistence: The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
3. Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
5. Collection: APT15 used various tools to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory, Microsoft SQL databases, Microsoft Sharepoint, and Microsoft Exchange.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks, such as VPN credentials, instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of TTPs related to credential access and remote network access. The CTI outline indicates that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access. This suggests that APT15 did use valid account information to access the network remotely.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline mentions that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials, which is a form of valid account information.
2. The CTI outline also mentions that APT15 stole a VPN certificate for remote network access, which is another form of valid account information.
3. The question asks whether APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks, which is consistent with the CTI outline.
4. The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.
5. Based on the CTI outline, it is clear that APT15 used valid account information to remotely access victim networks, making answer choice A the most plausible.

**Final Answer: A**
