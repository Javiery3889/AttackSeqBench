**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Stuxnet worm, which includes:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access to systems.
2. Execution: Running malicious code on both local and remote systems, including loading kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, and replacing legitimate system files with malicious versions.
3. Persistence: Achieving persistence by installing kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, and modifying system files and registry keys.
4. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges on infected systems.
5. Defense Evasion: Employing techniques to evade detection and analysis, including rootkit functionality, stolen digital certificates, and patching system libraries.
6. Lateral Movement: Propagating laterally through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities and shared resources.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Stuxnet will use FTP protocol for C2 communication after exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement within the network.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of FTP protocol for C2 communication. However, it does mention that Stuxnet communicated with command and control (C&C) servers during its execution phase. The question specifically asks about C2 communication after lateral movement, which is a part of the Execution phase.

The Execution phase is where Stuxnet's main module, a DLL packed with UPX, contained multiple resources, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, which were responsible for various tasks, including communicating with C&C servers.

Given this information, it is likely that Stuxnet would use a protocol for C2 communication, but the CTI outline does not specify FTP. However, the Execution phase does imply that Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers, which suggests that some form of communication protocol was used.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the question is asking whether Stuxnet will use FTP protocol for C2 communication after exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention FTP, but it does imply that Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers during its Execution phase.

Since the question is asking about a specific protocol (FTP) and the CTI outline does not provide information about the protocol used for C2 communication, we must evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided.

Given the lack of information about the protocol used for C2 communication, we cannot definitively say that Stuxnet will use FTP. However, the question is asking for a yes or no answer, and the correct answer is likely to be "No" because the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about FTP being used for C2 communication.

**Final Answer: B**
