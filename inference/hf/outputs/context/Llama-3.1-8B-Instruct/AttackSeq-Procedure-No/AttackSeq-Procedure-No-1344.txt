**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack attributed to the AURORA PANDA adversary, which leveraged a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) to infect victims with ZxShell malware through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on the website of the U.S. organization, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). However, it also mentions another adversary that used the same vulnerability to carry out targeted attacks nearly a month before the VFW attack, focusing on French aerospace. This other activity shares similarities with a 2012 SWC campaign affecting the website of U.S.-based turbine manufacturer, Capstone Turbine.

The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 is used to infect victims with ZxShell malware through a SWC on a website.
2. Victim Exploitation: The malware is used to gain access to the victim's system.
3. Command and Control (C2): The malware connects to a C2 server for further instructions.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after AURORA PANDA infects victims with ZxShell malware, it is likely that victim exploitation will use BUSHWALK to modify the DSUserAgentCap.pm Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for command and control.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions BUSHWALK, which is a tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and asks about its use in victim exploitation. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about BUSHWALK or its use in the attack. The outline focuses on the use of Sakula malware, GIFAS-based domains, and zero-day exploits.

Since the question specifically asks about BUSHWALK, we need to evaluate the answer choices based on the information provided.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the information in the CTI outline, there is no direct connection between the AURORA PANDA attack and the use of BUSHWALK. The outline focuses on the use of Sakula malware, GIFAS-based domains, and zero-day exploits, but does not mention BUSHWALK. Therefore, we cannot determine with certainty whether BUSHWALK will be used in the victim exploitation phase.

However, since the question asks for a likelihood, we can infer that the answer is likely "No" because there is no information in the CTI outline that suggests BUSHWALK will be used in the attack.

**Final Answer: B**
