**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics as follows:

1. Initial Access: A malicious Microsoft Word document titled 'Job-Details.doc' is delivered via LinkedIn messages, containing embedded malicious macros that initiate the infection process.
2. Persistence: A scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter' is created to execute the second stage payload, SideTwist, every 5 minutes.
3. Defense Evasion: DNS tunneling is used to avoid detection, with the initial macros stage using DNS requests to beacon back to the attacker and deliver victim identifiable information.
4. Command and Control: The SideTwist backdoor communicates with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using HTTP on port 443, with port 80 as a fallback.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the sequence of actions after persistence is established via a scheduled task named "SystemFailureReporter." The CTI outline indicates that the initial access was achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered via LinkedIn messages, which is the first step in the attack sequence.

However, the question is asking if the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document. The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the macros will only execute after initial access, but it does describe the initial access as the first step in the attack sequence.

Given the information provided, it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions after initial access is gained, as the persistence mechanism is established after the initial access. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A**
