**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack targeting Instagram users, particularly influencers. The attackers use various methods to deliver phishing messages, including:

1. Impersonating technical support or friends
2. Using phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages
3. Claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges to lure victims
4. Directing victims to phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface
5. Demanding ransom payments in bitcoin, prepaid credit cards, or vouchers for the return of the compromised accounts

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the attackers changing account passwords as a step in the attack sequence. However, it does mention that the attackers use phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface to collect credentials. This implies that the attackers may be attempting to obtain the original owners' credentials, which would likely involve changing the passwords to lock out the original owners.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the context of the attack, it is likely that the attackers will change the account passwords to lock out the original owners before using phishing sites to collect their credentials. This would allow the attackers to maintain control of the compromised accounts and use them for further malicious activities.

Final Answer: A
