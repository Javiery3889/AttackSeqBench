**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the execution of a malicious attack by the Lazarus group on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB). The attack sequence can be broken down into the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Execution: 
   - Deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) that established persistence via a registry key and attempted to disable specific antivirus processes.
   - Utilized a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, which was decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
   - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6), packed with Themida, designed to communicate with command and control servers.

2. Persistence:
   - Established persistence on the FEIB network by placing a copy of the loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) in the C:\Windows\Temp directory and setting a registry key for automatic execution.
   - Attempted to spread itself to other devices on the network using hardcoded user accounts and passwords related to FEIB.

3. Defense Evasion:
   - Attempted to kill specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command line tool.
   - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image, which was then decrypted and executed.
   - Packed the backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) with Themida to evade analysis and detection.

4. Lateral Movement:
   - Attempted lateral movement within the FEIB network by copying the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
   - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses, targeting active and responding devices, and established connections to SMB shares using the provided credentials.

5. Command and Control:
   - Utilized backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with remote command and control servers.
   - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number, and it polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute, maintaining a communication session and executing remote commands as directed.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware after establishing command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the Lazarus group engaging in double-extortion ransomware. However, it does describe the use of backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with remote command and control servers, which is a common tactic used in ransomware attacks. The question asks if the group engaged in double-extortion ransomware after establishing command and control communication, which implies that the group may have exfiltrated files and then encrypted them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the Lazarus group's use of backdoor malware to communicate with remote command and control servers suggests that they may have engaged in double-extortion ransomware. However, the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the encryption of files or the prompt for a ransom. Given the context of the question, it is likely that the group engaged in double-extortion ransomware, as this is a common tactic used in similar attacks.

Final Answer: A
