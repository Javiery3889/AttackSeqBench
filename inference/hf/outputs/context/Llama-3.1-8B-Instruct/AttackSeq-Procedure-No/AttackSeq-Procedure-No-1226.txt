**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the T9000 malware's behavior, including its initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, command and control, and exfiltration tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

**Attack Sequence:**

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 to deliver the T9000 malware via an RTF file.
2. Execution: Using a legitimate Microsoft executable (igfxtray.exe) to sideload a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll).
3. Persistence: Modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.
4. Defense Evasion: Customizing installation to avoid 24 identified security products, using a multi-stage installation process, and creating mutexes and named events.
5. Command and Control: Communicating with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
6. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether T9000 is likely to access the victim's webcam and record video as part of its data collection efforts after establishing persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention webcam access or video recording as part of T9000's data collection efforts. However, it does mention exfiltration of various types of data, including screenshots. This suggests that T9000 may be capable of accessing and exfiltrating visual data, but it does not provide direct evidence of webcam access or video recording.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, we can infer that T9000's exfiltration capabilities include collecting screenshots, which implies that it may have access to visual data. However, there is no explicit mention of webcam access or video recording. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine that T9000 will access the victim's webcam and record video.

However, considering the broad user targeting and extensive evasion techniques employed by T9000, it is possible that the malware may have the capability to access and exfiltrate visual data beyond just screenshots. Given the lack of explicit information, we must rely on the information provided.

Since the question asks for a likelihood, we must consider the context of the malware's capabilities and behavior. The fact that T9000 can exfiltrate screenshots suggests that it may have the capability to access visual data, but the question does not provide enough information to confirm webcam access or video recording.

**Final Answer: B**
