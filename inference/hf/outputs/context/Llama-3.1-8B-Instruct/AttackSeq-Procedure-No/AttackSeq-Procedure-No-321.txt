**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on an iOS malware. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned is:

1. Initial Access (not explicitly stated but implied as the malware is already installed)
2. Execution (the XAgent app is installed and runs in the background)
3. Discovery (the app collects various types of information on the iOS device)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations. The question is focused on the sequence of actions after the Execution phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the sequence of actions after the Execution phase, specifically after the app has already uploaded files via FTP protocol. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the sequence of actions after the Execution phase, but it does mention the Discovery phase, which involves the app collecting various types of information on the iOS device.

Given the context, it is likely that the app will send the gathered information via HTTP after performing the routines on the iOS device, as the Discovery phase is mentioned after the Execution phase. This suggests that the app will collect information and then send it via HTTP.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, focusing on an iOS malware.
2. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned is Initial Access, Execution, and Discovery.
3. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations.
4. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the sequence of actions after the Execution phase, but it does mention the Discovery phase, which involves collecting information on the iOS device.
5. Given the context, it is likely that the app will send the gathered information via HTTP after performing the routines on the iOS device.

**Final Answer: A**
