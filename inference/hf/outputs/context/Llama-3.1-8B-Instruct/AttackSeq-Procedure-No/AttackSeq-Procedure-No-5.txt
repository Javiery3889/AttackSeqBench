**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack attributed to Patchwork (Dropping Elephant), an Indian APT group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Patchwork launches spear phishing campaigns targeting US-based think tanks, using unique tracking links to identify recipients who opened their email messages.
2. **Initial Access**: The threat actors leverage domains and themes mimicking well-known think tank organizations, lifting articles and themes from organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS). They send spear phishing emails with links to .doc files (actually RTF documents) that exploit CVE-2017-8750 to deliver QuasarRAT.
3. **Persistence**: After QuasarRAT is delivered, it creates a scheduled task to remain persistent on the system.
4. **Command and Control**: The malware beacons to the threat actor's command and control domain, tautiaos.com.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence, the question is asking about the order of events. The CTI outline indicates that the spear phishing emails with links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 are sent to deliver QuasarRAT, which is the initial access step. This implies that the recipients receive the spear phishing emails before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the attack sequence, the correct answer is that recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery before getting infected with QuasarRAT.

Final Answer: B
