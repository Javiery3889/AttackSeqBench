**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Execution (using JSPRAT for local command execution and passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE)
4. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR)
5. Privilege Escalation (utilizing common techniques, including ProcDump and Mimikatz)
6. Defense Evasion (employing tactics like using passive backdoors and chaining web shells)
7. Credential Access (using techniques like process memory dumping and network sniffing)
8. Discovery (leveraging native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement after leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Discovery phase, which is step 8 in the attack sequence. After FIN13 has conducted internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and custom malware, the next step in the attack sequence is Collection (step 9). The question asks about the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data.

Based on the attack sequence, it is unlikely that FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data. Instead, the next step in the attack sequence is Collection, which involves collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question focuses on the Discovery phase, which is step 8 in the attack sequence.
2. The next step in the attack sequence after Discovery is Collection (step 9).
3. The question asks about the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data.
4. Based on the attack sequence, it is unlikely that FIN13 would use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement before collecting data.
5. Therefore, the correct answer is B: No.

**Final Answer: B**
