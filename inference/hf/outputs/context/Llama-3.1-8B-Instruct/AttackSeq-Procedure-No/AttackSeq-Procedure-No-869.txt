**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Sednit group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign with shortened URLs leading to an IP-address-based URL containing an executable file and a decoy PDF document.
2. Execution: The executable is run, prompting for a password and opening the decoy PDF, while a Delphi downloader continues to run in the background. The operators take control of the backdoor and send commands to gather data from the victim's computer.
3. Execution (continued): The operators download and execute a new downloader, written in C++, which then downloads a Delphi backdoor. The backdoor's configuration is stored in the resource section, split into four different hex-encoded, encrypted blobs.
4. Persistence: The operators use COM object hijacking for persistence, adding registry keys for a custom backdoor that is executed using the CMD_EXECUTE command.
5. Defense Evasion: The malware deletes files and kills processes to disable security tools.
6. Credential Access: The operators upload and use dumpers to target browsers and versions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016, retrieving databases related to credentials.
7. Discovery: The operators gather information about the victim's computer and environment.
8. Collection: The malware scans for files matching specific extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media, staging data for exfiltration.
9. Exfiltration: Data are automatically prepared with all file paths to retrieve and sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted with a known algorithm or a custom one.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the likelihood of data being sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports after a fallback C&C server embedded in the configuration becomes operational for communications during the Collection phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Collection phase, where the malware scans for files and stages data for exfiltration. The CTI outline does not provide information about a fallback C&C server or the use of commonly used ports for communication. However, it does mention that the data are sent to the C&C server after being prepared and hex-encoded.

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that the data will be sent to the primary C&C server over commonly used ports after a fallback C&C server becomes operational. The CTI outline does not mention the use of fallback C&C servers or the specific communication protocols used by the malware.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
