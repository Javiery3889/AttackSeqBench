**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence initiated by Shuckworm against a Ukrainian organization. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The attack chain began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email, containing a custom backdoor known as Pterodo.
2. Execution: Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
3. Persistence: Shuckworm established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes.
4. Defense Evasion: Shuckworm utilized mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
5. Collection: Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Shuckworm is likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does mention the use of VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain control over compromised systems. The question asks about the deployment of software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

However, the CTI outline does mention the use of VNC client as the ultimate payload for the attack on July 28, which implies that Shuckworm may have used a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised systems. The use of a C2 channel is a common technique used by attackers to maintain control over compromised systems.

Given the information provided, it is likely that Shuckworm would use a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised systems. However, the specific use of the GOGETTER tunneler and "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, it is likely that Shuckworm would use a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised systems, but the specific use of the GOGETTER tunneler and "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel is not mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the question asks if Shuckworm is likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

However, the question asks if Shuckworm is likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems.

Since the CTI outline does not provide information about the specific use of the GOGETTER tunneler and "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel, but it does imply the use of a C2 channel, the most plausible answer is that Shuckworm is likely to use a C2 channel to maintain control over the compromised systems.
