**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a multi-stage attack attributed to the Russian APT28 group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The attack starts with a Delphi-written dropper malware that downloads a second-stage payload from the internet and executes it.
2. Execution: The second-stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server, downloads the file 'upnphost.exe' to the path '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp', and implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key.
3. Persistence: The 'upnphost.exe' file maintains its foothold on the system by setting a registry key.
4. Defense Evasion: The dropper is submitted to Virus Total, and the 'upnphost.exe' file is analyzed, revealing its malicious behavior.
5. Command and Control: The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS and a POST method, and another file, 'sdbn.dll', contacts the domain 'marina-info.net', which resolves to an IP in Holland.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if APT28 will evade defenses through the analyzed dropper only after gathering system information and sending it to a server located in Hong Kong for Discovery purposes.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions gathering system information and sending it to a server located in Hong Kong, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does mention that the threat map indicates the attack surface covered by the hacker group is wide, with C2Cs in Europe and China. This suggests that APT28 may have a global presence, including servers in Hong Kong.

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the dropper evading defenses after gathering system information and sending it to a server in Hong Kong. However, the fact that the dropper is submitted to Virus Total and the 'upnphost.exe' file is analyzed suggests that APT28 may use various evasion techniques to avoid detection.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, it is possible that APT28 may use various evasion techniques, including submitting the dropper to Virus Total, to avoid detection. However, the question specifically asks about evading defenses through the analyzed dropper after gathering system information and sending it to a server located in Hong Kong. Since this specific scenario is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, we must rely on the general information provided.

Given the information, it is not explicitly stated that APT28 will evade defenses through the analyzed dropper after gathering system information and sending it to a server located in Hong Kong. Therefore, the most conservative answer would be that it is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B**
