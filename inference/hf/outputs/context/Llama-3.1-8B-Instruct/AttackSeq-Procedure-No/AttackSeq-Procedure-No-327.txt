**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
2. Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices but not on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the device, including text messages, contact lists, pictures, geo-location data, voice recordings, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after the Command and Control phase, the app will collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data on the victim's device during the Discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline describes the Discovery phase as the phase where the app collects various types of information from the device. The question specifically asks about collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, which are all mentioned in the Discovery phase of the CTI outline.

Given this information, it is likely that the app will collect this information during the Discovery phase, as it is explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the Discovery phase as the phase where the app collects various types of information from the device.
2. The question specifically asks about collecting text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, which are all mentioned in the Discovery phase.
3. Therefore, it is likely that the app will collect this information during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A**
