**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with embedded Word documents containing VBS macros. The campaign's initial access was achieved through these phishing emails, which delivered Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware upon successful execution. The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware after initial access is gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk. This suggests that the script would execute queries to gather system information and download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
2. Initial Access: Phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. Defense Evasion: PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, using the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads.

The question specifically asks about the sequence of events following initial access, which involves the execution of a COM object to gather system information and download payloads. Based on the CTI outline, this is a likely sequence of events.

**Final Answer: A**
