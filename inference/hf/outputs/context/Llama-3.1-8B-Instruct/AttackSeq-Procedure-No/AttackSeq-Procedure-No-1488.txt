**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically targeting Ukrainian power facilities using BlackEnergy 3 malware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager (CVE-2014-4114) to infect systems.
2. Execution: Executing a Visual Basic macro embedded in an Excel document, which reassembles and executes a portable executable (PE32) named vba_macro.exe.
3. Execution: The PE32 executable drops two additional executables, FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, and then deletes itself.
4. Persistence: Registering FONTCACHE.DAT to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function for persistence.
5. Defense Evasion: Using anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt() function calls, SetUnhandledExceptionFilter API, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent API.
6. Discovery: Gathering information for lateral movement using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API to retrieve network information for the local computer.
7. Lateral Movement: Sending data to servers deployed in major ISPs across Europe.
8. Command and Control: Communicating with its C2 server using HTTP protocol, sending localization data and keyboard layout information.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether BlackEnergy 3 malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox as part of its exfiltration process after using HTTP protocol to communicate with its C2 server and send localization data and keyboard layout information.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention Dropbox as a part of the exfiltration process. In fact, it only mentions that the malware communicates with its C2 server using HTTP protocol, sending localization data and keyboard layout information. There is no indication that the malware is designed to exfiltrate files to Dropbox.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence does not include exfiltrating files to Dropbox. The malware's exfiltration process is not specified, and there is no mention of Dropbox as a target for exfiltration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
