**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a series of attacks by an unknown threat actor. The key details are:

- Initial Access: 
  - July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
  - February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day.

- Persistence: 
  - February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

- Credential Access: 
  - July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.

- Command and Control: 
  - May 2015: Attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks.

- Others: 
  - The attack group's early operations were relatively unsophisticated and readily picked up by the security industry.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase after leveraging an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains during the Credential Access phase (July to August 2011). This indicates that the group used phishing domains to gather user credentials.

However, the question specifically asks about the reconnaissance phase after the initial access using the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability. The CTI outline does not provide information about the specific tactics used during the reconnaissance phase after the initial access.

Given the information provided, we cannot directly determine whether the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. However, we can infer that the group used phishing domains to gather user credentials in the past.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase. However, we can infer that the group used phishing domains to gather user credentials in the past.

Since the question does not provide enough information to determine the exact tactics used during the reconnaissance phase, we must rely on the information provided in the CTI outline. The CTI outline mentions that the group used phishing domains to gather user credentials, but it does not provide information about the specific tactics used during the reconnaissance phase.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine whether the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase.

However, since the question asks for a choice between "Yes" and "No", and given that the CTI outline does not provide information about the specific tactics used during the reconnaissance phase, we can only choose the answer that is most consistent with the information provided.

Since the CTI outline does not provide information about the specific tactics used during the reconnaissance phase, we cannot conclusively determine whether the attack group harvested user's login credentials instead of using phishing domains. However, the CTI outline does mention that the group used phishing domains to gather user credentials in the past.

Given the lack of information about the specific tactics used during the reconnaissance phase, we can only choose the answer that is most consistent with the information provided.

Final Answer: B
