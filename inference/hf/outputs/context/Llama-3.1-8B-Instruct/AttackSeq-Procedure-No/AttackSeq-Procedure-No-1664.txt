**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically targeting Microsoft Exchange mail servers. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: T1078, Valid Accounts (stolen credentials)
2. Execution: T1086, PowerShell (PowerShell script to install LightNeuron)
3. Privilege Escalation: T1078, Valid Accounts (stolen credentials for administrative rights)
4. Discovery: T1016, System Network Configuration Discovery (LightNeuron discovers system network configurations)
5. Collection: T1114, Email Collection (collects emails matching specified rules), T1005, Data from Local System (exfiltrates local files), and T1119, Automated Collection (automated collection of files from a specific path)
6. Exfiltration: T1041, Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel (data exfiltration through email C&C channel) and T1029, Scheduled Transfer (scheduled data transfer), and T1022, Data Encrypted (data encryption using AES)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether LightNeuron is likely to use FTP protocol for Command and Control (C&C) communication instead of emails by aligning its activity with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline states that LightNeuron exfiltrates data through the email C&C channel (T1041, Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel). This indicates that the current method of C&C communication is through email, not FTP. There is no mention of FTP protocol being used for C&C communication in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
