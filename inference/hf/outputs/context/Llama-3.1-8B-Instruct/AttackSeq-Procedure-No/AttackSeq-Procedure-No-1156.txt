**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

- The CTI outline describes a cyber attack targeting Instagram users, particularly influencers, through phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram.
- The attackers impersonate technical support or friends of the victims to lure them into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimic Instagram's interface.
- The attackers collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials through these phishing sites.
- After obtaining the credentials, the attackers change the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners.
- They also download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence in the Order Presented by the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**

1. Initial Access: Phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram are used to deliver messages to victims.
2. Credential Access: Phishing sites are used to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.
3. Credential Access (continued): The attackers change the account passwords, locking out the original owners.
4. Data Exfiltration: The attackers download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

**Step 3: Analyze the Question and Answer Choices**

The question asks if the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before locking out the original owners by changing the passwords.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence identified in the CTI outline, the attackers download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature, after changing the account passwords. This implies that the attackers do not stop the backup services before changing the passwords; instead, they use the backup feature to download the data.

**Step 5: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The attackers use phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram credentials.
2. The question asks if the attackers will stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords.
3. According to the CTI outline, the attackers download all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature, after changing the passwords.
4. This implies that the attackers do not stop the backup services before changing the passwords.

**Final Answer: B**
