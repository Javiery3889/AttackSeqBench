**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a multi-stage malware attack attributed to the Russian APT28 group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware uses a Delphi-written dropper to download a second-stage payload from the internet and execute it.
2. Execution: The second-stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server, downloads the file 'upnphost.exe' to the path '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp', and implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key.
3. Persistence: The 'upnphost.exe' file maintains its foothold on the system by setting a registry key.
4. Defense Evasion: The dropper is submitted to Virus Total, and the 'upnphost.exe' file is likely submitted due to an evasion technique implemented by the dropper.
5. Discovery: The malware sends information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command after using HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the malware uses the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to send information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127'. This suggests that the malware does indeed use this command to discover system information and process lists.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the malware's attack sequence includes the use of the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command as part of its discovery phase. This command is used to gather system information and process lists, which are then sent to the C2 server.

Therefore, it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command.

Final Answer: A
