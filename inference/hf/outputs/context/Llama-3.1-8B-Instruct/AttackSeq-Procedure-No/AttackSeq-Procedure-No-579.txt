**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN8 group, a threat actor targeting retail, hospitality, and entertainment sectors. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The FIN8 group uses a backdoor called BADHATCH to gain initial access to networks.
2. Execution: BADHATCH operates in two modes: CMD or POWERSHELL. In POWERSHELL mode, it launches powershell.exe with a command line that executes commands from a pipe using IEX. In CMD mode, it uses cmd.exe to execute a different set of commands.
3. Persistence: FIN8 ensures persistence by using the WMI event subscription mechanism.
4. Privilege Escalation: The deployment of BADHATCH involves privilege escalation, as indicated by the execution of a script named sh-tmp.ps1, which likely escalates privileges since subsequent commands are executed on behalf of the SYSTEM user.
5. Defense Evasion: BADHATCH employs various defense evasion techniques, including the use of TLS encryption to conceal PowerShell commands and masquerading its communication with the C&C server as legitimate HTTP requests.
6. Credential Access: Credential dumping is suggested by the execution of a script named mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
7. Lateral Movement: Lateral movement to the Domain Controller was achieved using wmic.exe to create a process on the DC and execute the BADHATCH deployment script.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery using tools such as nltest.exe and ping.exe before performing system owner/user discovery by issuing commands like whoami.exe.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the FIN8 group's tactics suggest that they are likely to conduct lateral movement to the Domain Controller using wmic.exe to create a process on the DC and execute the BADHATCH deployment script. This implies that they have already gained initial access and executed commands in POWERSHELL mode, which allows them to execute commands from a pipe using IEX.

After gaining access to the Domain Controller, it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery using tools such as nltest.exe and ping.exe to gather information about the domain structure and identify potential targets for further exploitation. This is a common step in lateral movement, as it allows the attackers to understand the network topology and identify potential entry points for further attacks.

Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will conduct domain trust discovery before performing system owner/user discovery by issuing commands like whoami.exe.
