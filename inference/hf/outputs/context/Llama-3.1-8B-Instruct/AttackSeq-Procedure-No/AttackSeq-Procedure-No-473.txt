**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Infamous Chisel malware. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Execution: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
2. Persistence: The malware persists on the system by replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
3. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and checks that it is executed by init and at the path for the legitimate netd.
5. Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information.
6. Discovery: The netd component enumerates multiple data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
7. Collection: The netd component collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
8. Exfiltration: Infamous Chisel exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to perform discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component after leveraging its Command and Control capabilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the netd component, which is associated with discovery activities in the CTI outline. The CTI outline also mentions that the netd component is used for enumeration and IP scanning. The question asks if this is likely to happen after leveraging Command and Control capabilities, which is mentioned in the CTI outline as part of the Execution tactic.

The Command and Control capabilities of Infamous Chisel include providing SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client. These capabilities are used for Execution, which is the first step in the attack sequence.

Given that the netd component is used for discovery activities and is associated with the Execution tactic, it is likely that Infamous Chisel will perform discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the netd component after leveraging its Command and Control capabilities.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
