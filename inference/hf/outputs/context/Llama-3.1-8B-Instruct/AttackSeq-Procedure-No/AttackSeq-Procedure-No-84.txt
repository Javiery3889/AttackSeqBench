**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Vyveva backdoor, which is attributed to the Lazarus threat actor. The outline covers the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Execution: ESET researchers discovered a new Lazarus backdoor named Vyveva, which executes via a service (T1569.002) and uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106).
2. Persistence: The Vyveva installer creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003).
3. Defense Evasion: Vyveva decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140), can timestomp files (T1070.006), masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004), modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112), and has encrypted strings and components (T1027).
4. Discovery: Vyveva's backdoor can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), list running processes (T1057), obtain system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version and architecture (T1082), obtain the local IP address (T1016), and system time and time zone (T1124).
5. Collection: Vyveva's backdoor can compress files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002), collect files from the computer (T1005), and notify C&C about newly inserted removable media and collect files from them (T1025).
6. Command and Control: Vyveva's backdoor encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001), communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002), and exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041).

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic after compressing files with zlib for collection during the Collection tactic.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that Vyveva's backdoor can compress files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002) as part of the Collection tactic. However, it does not provide information about dividing files based on size. The Exfiltration tactic is mentioned in the Command and Control tactic, where Vyveva's backdoor exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041).

Given the information provided, there is no direct indication that Vyveva divides files based on size during the Exfiltration tactic. The question seems to be asking about a specific behavior that is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
