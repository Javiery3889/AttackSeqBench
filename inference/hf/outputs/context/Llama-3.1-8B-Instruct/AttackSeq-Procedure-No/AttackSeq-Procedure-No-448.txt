**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Agrius. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications using publicly available exploits (CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection).
2. Execution: Deploying custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. Persistence: Registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service for persistence and deploying webshells.
4. Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation and a custom base64 encoding function, and updating the backdoor to evade defenses.
5. Lateral Movement: Tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement.
6. Command and Control: Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP, awaiting commands for data exfiltration, file download, and self-deletion.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Command and Control phase, where the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers. The question asks about the deployment of CaddyWiper, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does describe data exfiltration and file download activities, which are related to the Command and Control phase.

Given the context, it is unlikely that Agrius would deploy CaddyWiper as part of its data destruction activities after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers. The CTI outline does not mention CaddyWiper or any data destruction activities related to OT capabilities, mapped drives, or physical drive partitions.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
