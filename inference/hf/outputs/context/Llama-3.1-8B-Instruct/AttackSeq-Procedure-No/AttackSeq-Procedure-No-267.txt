**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Mustang Panda campaign using the Korplug variant. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
2. Execution: A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable to execute the Korplug variant.
3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a directory, setting up a scheduled task or registry entry, and copying necessary files.
4. Defense Evasion: The campaign uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques throughout the deployment process.
5. Discovery: Korplug collects system information, including metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
6. Command and Control: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence, Korplug collects metadata and content from local systems and removable media during the Discovery phase. After that, it communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control. Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

Given this sequence, it is likely that Korplug will proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media, not before gathering data from network shared drives.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. Korplug collects metadata and content from local systems and removable media during the Discovery phase.
2. After collecting this information, Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol for command and control.
3. Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for command and control.
4. Therefore, it is likely that Korplug will proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after collecting metadata and content from local systems and removable media.

**Final Answer: B**
