**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Smooth Operator malware's behavior, including its initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and command and control (C2) tactics. Key points from the outline include:

- Initial Access: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
- Execution: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software and creates a new thread to run its functionality.
- Persistence: Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
- Defense Evasion: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including daemonizing and detaching from the 3CX process, deleting itself from disk, and writing configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
- Discovery: Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including OS version, domain, and account name values.
- Collection: The malware stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration.
- Command and Control: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after automatically exfiltrating collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request, it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we know that the Smooth Operator malware:

- Communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS (Command and Control).
- Uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation (Command and Control).

The question specifically asks about the malware's behavior after automatically exfiltrating collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request. Given that the malware's C2 communication is already established over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm, it is reasonable to assume that this behavior will continue after exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The malware's C2 communication is established over HTTPS.
2. The malware uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
3. The question asks about the malware's behavior after exfiltration, which is a part of its C2 communication.
4. Given the malware's established behavior, it is likely that it will continue to communicate with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

**Final Answer: A**
