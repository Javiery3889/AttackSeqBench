**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the VERMIN malware's behavior, including its Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, and Command and Control tactics. The key details are:

- Initial Access: The malware is a Remote Access Tool (RAT) written in .NET, uses HTTP encapsulated SOAP for C2, and was initially identified through a tweet about a sample with a Ukrainian Ministry of Defense theme.
- Execution: The malware checks the system language, decrypts an embedded resource, sets up a scheduled task, and collects system information.
- Persistence: The malware establishes persistence by setting itself to run as a scheduled task every 30 minutes indefinitely.
- Defense Evasion: The malware uses ConfuserEx to pack and obfuscate its code and checks for anti-virus software.
- Discovery: The malware collects system information, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and checks for installed anti-virus software.
- Command and Control: The malware communicates with its C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and the WSHttpBinding() API.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after collecting system information, the VERMIN malware will utilize tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under %appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the VERMIN malware collects system information, including machine name, username, and local IP address using WMI queries. However, there is no mention of the malware utilizing tools to capture mouse movements. Instead, the malware stores keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under %appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings if anti-virus software is not detected.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the malware's behavior after collecting system information.
2. The CTI outline states that the malware collects system information, including machine name, username, and local IP address using WMI queries.
3. There is no mention of the malware utilizing tools to capture mouse movements.
4. The malware stores keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under %appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings if anti-virus software is not detected.
5. Therefore, the correct answer is that the malware will not utilize tools to capture mouse movements.

**Final Answer: B**
