**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government, exploiting an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team data breach. The attack sequence involves:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
2. Execution: The Flash exploit, 'show.swf', contains ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload.
3. Execution: The ActionScript classes involved in the exploit are MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, and ShellWin32.as.
4. Execution: The 'TryExpl' function within MyClass.as creates a use-after-free condition to exploit CVE-2015-5119.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. However, it does mention that the ActionScript classes involved in the exploit are similar to those used in a previous UPS attack exploiting CVE-2015-3113, which involved data type manipulation, logging, and decrypting shellcode. This suggests that the attack may involve some form of data manipulation or logging.

The question asks about downgrading NTLM to capture NTLM hashes, which is a specific technique that is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, given the context of the attack and the involvement of UPS, which is known for its sophisticated tactics, it is possible that the attack may involve some form of credential harvesting or NTLM hash capture.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, it is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline that the Flash file 'show.swf' will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes. However, considering the context of the attack and the involvement of UPS, which is known for its sophisticated tactics, it is possible that the attack may involve some form of credential harvesting or NTLM hash capture.

Given the answer choices, the most plausible answer is that the Flash file 'show.swf' will not explicitly downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes, but it is possible that the attack may involve some form of credential harvesting or NTLM hash capture, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Final Answer: B**
