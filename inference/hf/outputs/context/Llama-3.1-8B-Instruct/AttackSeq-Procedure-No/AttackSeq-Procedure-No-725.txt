**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Stuxnet worm, which includes:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access to systems.
2. Execution: Running malicious code on both local and remote systems, including loading kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, and replacing legitimate system files with malicious versions.
3. Persistence: Achieving persistence by installing kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, and modifying system files and registry keys.
4. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities (MS10-073 and MS10-092) to escalate privileges on infected systems.
5. Defense Evasion: Employing techniques to evade detection and analysis, including rootkit functionality, stolen digital certificates, and patching system libraries.
6. Lateral Movement: Propagating laterally through networks by exploiting vulnerabilities and shared resources, including the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Stuxnet will exploit the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement within the network after communicating with its C&C servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that Stuxnet's lateral movement capabilities involve exploiting vulnerabilities and shared resources, including the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities. However, it does not specify that these vulnerabilities are used after communicating with C&C servers. In fact, the lateral movement section is described as a separate phase that occurs after the execution phase, which includes communication with C&C servers.

Given this information, it is likely that Stuxnet will exploit the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement within the network, but not necessarily after communicating with its C&C servers. The question's phrasing suggests a specific sequence of events, but the CTI outline does not provide a clear indication that these vulnerabilities are used in this specific order.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
