**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the LuoYu Attack Group's WinDealer malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. **Execution**: The malware executes by reading its configuration from a file and loading a DLL module into memory.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The malware employs defense evasion techniques such as encoding its configuration files and encrypting communication with C2 servers using RSA and AES.
3. **Discovery**: The malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration, as well as data from SNS applications.
4. **Collection**: The malware collects data from the victim's PC, including files stored on USB memory, documents, desktop items, and recycle bin contents.
5. **Exfiltration**: The malware exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) before stealing information from SNS applications and encrypting this data using AES.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that the malware employs defense evasion techniques, including encrypting communication with C2 servers using RSA and AES. However, there is no mention of using non-standard ports (UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556) for communication. The malware's communication with C2 servers is not explicitly described in the CTI outline, but it is mentioned that the malware uses encrypted channels for communication.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is unlikely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556. The malware's communication with C2 servers is encrypted, but the specific ports used are not mentioned.

Final Answer: B
