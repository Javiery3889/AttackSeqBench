**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Turla APT group using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The Turla APT group uses a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor.
2. Execution: The MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper (Scr.js).
3. Execution: The JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
4. Defense Evasion: The JavaScript dropper (Scr.js) fingerprints the infected system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion.
5. Discovery: Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file.
6. Command and Control: The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
7. Exfiltration: The updated KopiLuwak backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C&C and download files to the infected machine.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Scr.js will install itself as a cron job before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the installation of Scr.js as a cron job. However, it does mention that Scr.js sets up persistence without raising suspicion. This implies that Scr.js may establish a mechanism to ensure its execution, but it does not provide specific details about the method used.

The question specifically asks about the installation of Scr.js as a cron job, which is a Linux-specific concept. The CTI outline does not provide information about the operating system used by the target system. However, it does mention that the dropper is a .NET/MSIL dropper, which suggests that the target system is likely a Windows system.

Given the lack of information about the target system's operating system and the specific method used by Scr.js to establish persistence, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Scr.js will install itself as a cron job.

However, considering the context of the question and the CTI outline, the most plausible answer is that Scr.js will not install itself as a cron job, as the CTI outline does not provide any information about Scr.js using this method to establish persistence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:
