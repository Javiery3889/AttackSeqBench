**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the SUNSPOT malware's behavior, which is used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Execution**: SUNSPOT malware is used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds.
2. **Persistence**: SUNSPOT malware maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute at host boot.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: SUNSPOT malware grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token to add SeDebugPrivilege.
4. **Defense Evasion**: SUNSPOT employs several defense evasion techniques, including encryption, masquerading, and code obfuscation.
5. **Discovery**: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files then encrypting them, as part of the Impact tactic, after monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, SUNSPOT's primary goal is to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds. The malware's behavior is focused on maintaining persistence, escalating privileges, evading detection, and monitoring for specific processes. There is no indication that SUNSPOT is designed to engage in double-extortion ransomware tactics.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. SUNSPOT's primary goal is to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds.
2. The malware's behavior is focused on maintaining persistence, escalating privileges, evading detection, and monitoring for specific processes.
3. There is no indication that SUNSPOT is designed to engage in double-extortion ransomware tactics.
4. Therefore, it is unlikely that SUNSPOT will engage in double-extortion ransomware, exfiltrating files then encrypting them, as part of the Impact tactic.

**Final Answer: B**
