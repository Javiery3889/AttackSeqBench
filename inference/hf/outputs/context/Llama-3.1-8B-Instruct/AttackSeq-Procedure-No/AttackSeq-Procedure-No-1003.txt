**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Longhorn group, a threat actor. The outline is organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: Longhorn uses back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets.
2. Defense Evasion: Longhorn employs practices to avoid detection, including wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, and secure erase protocols.
3. Discovery: Longhorn's malware performs system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
4. Collection: Longhorn's malware has remote control capabilities and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
5. Command and Control: Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by Longhorn's malware after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration. The question is focused on the Command and Control (C2) tactic.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question asks if Longhorn's malware will configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol after communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration. This is directly related to the Command and Control tactic described in the CTI outline.

According to the CTI outline, Longhorn's malware does configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity. This is a key aspect of their Command and Control tactic.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, Longhorn's malware does configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This is a critical aspect of their Command and Control tactic.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
