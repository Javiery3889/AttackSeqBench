**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government, exploiting an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) from the Hacking Team data breach. The attack sequence involves:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
2. Execution: The Flash exploit, 'show.swf', contains ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload.
3. Execution: The shellcode installs a payload, which is embedded in a GIF image (b.gif).

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Flash file 'show.swf' will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion only after the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence is:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing attack exploiting CVE-2015-5119.
2. Execution: The Flash exploit, 'show.swf', contains ActionScript designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload.
3. Execution: The shellcode installs a payload, which is embedded in a GIF image (b.gif).

The question asks about the order of events after the initial access. The CTI outline indicates that the shellcode executes to install the payload, which is then embedded in a GIF image. Therefore, the shellcode does not execute for Defense Evasion after installing the payload.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
