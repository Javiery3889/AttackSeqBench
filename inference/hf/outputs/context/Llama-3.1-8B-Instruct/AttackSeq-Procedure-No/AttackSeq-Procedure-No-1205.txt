**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a series of events related to a sophisticated supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, an IT managed services provider. The attackers deployed a custom backdoor, Sunburst, on the networks of over 18,000 customers, allowing for further exploitation. The outline also mentions another APT actor, HAFNIUM, exploiting zero-days in Exchange Server for initial access.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence**

The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: Compromise of SolarWinds through a supply-chain attack.
2. Initial Access: Exploitation of zero-days in Exchange Server by HAFNIUM.
3. Persistence: Deployment of the Sunburst backdoor on the networks of over 18,000 customers.
4. Command and Control (C2): The Sunburst backdoor communicates with its C2 server.

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence identified in Step 2, the Sunburst backdoor is deployed after the initial access is achieved through the supply-chain attack on SolarWinds. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server before the initial access is achieved.

**Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices**

Considering the attack sequence, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
