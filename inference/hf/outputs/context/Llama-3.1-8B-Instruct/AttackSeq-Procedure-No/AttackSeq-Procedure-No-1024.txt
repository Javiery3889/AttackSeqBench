**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically targeting Armenian websites with a watering hole operation attributed to the Turla group. The attack sequence involves:

1. Initial Access: Turla uses a fake Adobe Flash update lure to deliver malware (NetFlash and PyFlash) to compromised websites.
2. Execution: The fake installer installs both a Turla malware variant and a legitimate Adobe Flash program, leading users to believe the update was legitimate.
3. Persistence: NetFlash and PyFlash establish persistence using Windows scheduled tasks.
4. Discovery: The PyFlash backdoor executes various OS-related commands to gather information about the machine and sends it to the C&C server.
5. Exfiltration: The output of PyFlash surveillance and C&C commands are exfiltrated using the C&C protocol.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether NetFlash and PyFlash will use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography after the PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information on the infected machine and sends it to the C&C server.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can infer that the C&C protocol used by PyFlash for exfiltrating data is not explicitly mentioned as using HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography. However, the fact that the C&C protocol is used for exfiltration suggests that it is likely to be a secure communication channel. Given that the Turla group has been active for over ten years and has shifted payloads to evade detection, it is plausible that they would use secure communication protocols to maintain their operations.

However, the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the use of HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography for communication between NetFlash and PyFlash and their respective C&C servers. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the answer based on the provided information.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the lack of explicit information about the use of HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography, we must rely on general knowledge about the Turla group's tactics and the typical use of secure communication protocols in C2 (Command and Control) operations.

While it is possible that the Turla group might use HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography for secure communication, the CTI outline does not provide sufficient information to confirm this. However, considering the group's history of using secure communication protocols to evade detection, it is plausible that they might use HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography.

However, the question specifically asks about the use of HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography after the PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information and sends it to the C&C server. The CTI outline does not provide information about the specific communication protocol used by NetFlash after it downloads its second-stage malware.

Given the lack of explicit information and the fact that the question specifically asks about the use of HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography after the PyFlash backdoor gathers OS-related information, we cannot conclusively determine the answer.

However, considering the general knowledge about C2 operations and the Turla group's tactics, it is more likely that they would use a secure communication protocol like HTTPS and Asymmetric Cryptography for communication between their malware and C&C servers.

**Final Answer: A**
