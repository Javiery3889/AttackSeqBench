**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the cyberespionage group FamousSparrow. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Resource Development: Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquire infrastructure.
2. Initial Access: Exploiting the same vulnerabilities to gain access to the systems.
3. Execution: Utilizing cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor, and exploiting the same vulnerabilities to execute SparrowDoor on the compromised systems.
4. Persistence: Creating a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installing it as a service, and using DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
5. Defense Evasion: Injecting the encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusting token privileges to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, and obfuscating files or information.
6. Discovery: Collecting system information and probing files in specified directories.
7. Collection: Reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.
8. Command and Control: Communicating with the C&C server using HTTPS protocol and encrypted/decrypted communications.
9. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access. However, it does mention that the group used the same vulnerabilities for Initial Access and Execution, which suggests that they may have obtained credentials or access to the systems through these vulnerabilities. The Discovery phase is mentioned after the Execution phase, which implies that the group would have already gained access to the systems and would be collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase after gaining access to the systems through the Initial Access and Execution phases. However, there is no mention of using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
