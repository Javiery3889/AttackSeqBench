**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence by Mustang Panda, a threat actor, using the Korplug variant. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Initial Access**: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to gain initial access.
2. **Execution**: A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable to execute the Korplug variant.
3. **Persistence**: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a directory, copying files, and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The campaign uses control-flow obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and encryption at every stage of the deployment process.
5. **Discovery**: Korplug collects system information, including uptime, Windows version, and IP addresses.
6. **Collection**: Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
7. **Exfiltration**: Data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Korplug variant will communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, only before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the exfiltration phase, which is step 7 in the attack sequence. According to the CTI outline, data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol, which matches the question. However, the question also mentions the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. Nevertheless, the CTI outline does mention that the Korplug variant uses a custom protocol for sending and receiving commands, which implies that the initial handshake could be over TCP.

The question also specifies that the custom TCP-based protocol is used only before collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This is consistent with the CTI outline, which describes data collection as a separate step (step 6) after exfiltration (step 7).

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
