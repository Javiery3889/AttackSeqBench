**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Dexphot attack, which involves a complex execution stage where it writes five key files to disk. These files include an installer, an MSI package file, a password-protected ZIP archive, a loader DLL, and an encrypted data file containing three additional executables. The executables are then loaded into system processes via process hollowing, targeting legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe, and later svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe.

The persistence mechanism involves dual monitoring services that check the status of all three malicious processes and re-infected the device if any were terminated. It also uses schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection, employing techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage after utilizing fileless techniques for defense evasion.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline explicitly states that Dexphot uses process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage. This is mentioned in the following sentence: "These executables were loaded into system processes via process hollowing, targeting legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe, and later svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe."

Given this information, we can conclude that Dexphot does use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the Dexphot attack, which involves a complex execution stage where it writes five key files to disk.
