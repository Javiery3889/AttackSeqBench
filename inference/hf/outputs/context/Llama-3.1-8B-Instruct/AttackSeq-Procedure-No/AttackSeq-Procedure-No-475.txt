**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Infamous Chisel malware. The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Execution: The malware replaces the legitimate netd service and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
2. Persistence: The malware persists on the system by replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
3. Privilege Escalation: The malware executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware checks that it is executed by init and at the path for the legitimate netd, impairing defenses.
5. Credential Access: The malware scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information.
6. Discovery: The malware enumerates multiple data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
7. Collection: The malware collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
8. Command and Control: The malware provides SCP functionality, a Tor hidden service, and SSH connections.
9. Exfiltration: The malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Infamous Chisel malware will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections after it impacts the system by replacing the legitimate netd service.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly asks about the Exfiltration tactic, which is the 9th step in the attack sequence. The CTI outline clearly states that the malware's netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the malware's netd component is responsible for exfiltration, and it does so using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. Therefore, after the malware impacts the system by replacing the legitimate netd service, it is likely that it will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

Final Answer: A
