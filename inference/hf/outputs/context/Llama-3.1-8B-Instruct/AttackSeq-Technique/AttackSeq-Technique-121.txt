**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor Agrius. The key points are:

1. Initial Access: Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, and used 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection to gain initial access.
2. Execution: Agrius deployed custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', which was used for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. Persistence: Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service on compromised systems.
4. Defense Evasion: Agrius used webshells with obfuscation and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor contained functionality to update its engine and delete traces of itself.
5. Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
6. Impact: Agrius deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, to destroy data on targeted systems.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Command and Control
6. Impact

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique that enabled Agrius to exploit systems remotely within the targeted network after using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions webshells being used to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement. This is related to the "Execution" phase, where Agrius deployed custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', which was used for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.

The answer choices are:

A: T1552.008-Chat Messages
B: T1573-Encrypted Channel
C: T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services
D: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares

The correct answer is related to exploiting remote services, as Agrius used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement, which is a form of exploiting remote services.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

The question mentions webshells being used to tunnel RDP traffic for lateral movement, which is related to exploiting remote services. The correct answer is T1210-Exploitation of Remote Services, as it aligns with the attack sequence and the use of webshells to tunnel RDP traffic.

Final Answer: C
