**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attack begins with reconnaissance, where SCILabs identified a new Cosmic Banker attack targeting user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
2. Initial Access: The attack starts with an email impersonating Mexico's tax department, which includes a link to download a malicious attachment.
3. Execution: The malicious attachment triggers the attack, which includes a batch programming script that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
4. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features.
5. Defense Evasion: The main malicious file is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
6. Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials from Mexican financial institution users.
7. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from the contacts list.
8. Exfiltration: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains to download the malware and send collected data.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is focused on the communication between the PowerShell script and the domains. Based on the CTI outline, the PowerShell script is executed from the Internet to run at memory level, and it downloads files from the Internet. This suggests that the communication is happening at the application layer.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The PowerShell script is executed from the Internet, which implies that it is communicating with a domain or a server.
2. The script downloads files from the Internet, which also suggests that it is communicating with a domain or a server.
3. The communication is happening at the application layer, as the script is using PowerShell to interact with the Internet.
4. Based on the above points, the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the communication of the PowerShell script with the domains is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Final Answer: D**
