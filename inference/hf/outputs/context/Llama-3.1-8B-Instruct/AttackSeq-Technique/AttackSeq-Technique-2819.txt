**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The adversary obtained SSH access to the target system.
2. Execution: The custom loader loads the Derusbi malware into memory, which then drops the Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to disk, loads it into the kernel, and deletes it from disk.
3. Persistence: The Turbo LKM provides persistence by hiding processes.
4. Defense Evasion: The Derusbi malware and Turbo kernel module employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques.
5. Discovery: The Derusbi malware gathers information about the victim host, including the local host name, GCC version, and system information, which is transferred back to the command and control infrastructure via network beacons.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after Derusbi gathered system information about the victim's host for discovery, to establish communication with the command and control server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the following sequence of TTPs:

1. Derusbi gathered system information about the victim's host for discovery.
2. Establish communication with the command and control server via HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp.

The CTI outline mentions that the Derusbi malware gathers information about the victim host and transfers it back to the command and control infrastructure via network beacons. This is followed by the Defense Evasion and Persistence tactics, but the specific communication method is not mentioned.

However, the question specifically mentions HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp, which is a clue to the communication method used.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline and the question, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred after Derusbi gathered system information about the victim's host is the communication with the command and control server via HTTP POST requests.

The correct answer choice is D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol, as it involves communication with the command and control server via HTTP POST requests.

Final Answer: D
