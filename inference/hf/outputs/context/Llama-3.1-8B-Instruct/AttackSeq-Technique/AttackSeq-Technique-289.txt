**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Dropping Elephant. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server upon opening.
2. Initial Access: Subsequent spear-phishing email with an MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or a PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352.
3. Initial Access: Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a PowerPoint document to view the entire article, which contains a malicious artifact.
4. Execution: The backdoor used by Dropping Elephant is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
5. Execution: The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
6. Defense Evasion: The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts, which are then executed to download additional malware.
7. Credential Access: The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials among other data.
8. Collection: The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
9. Command and Control: The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used by Dropping Elephant to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities before gaining Initial Access through spear-phishing emails with malicious documents exploiting CVE vulnerabilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the technique used before the Initial Access phase, which is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline mentions that Dropping Elephant uses watering hole attacks to gather information. Watering hole attacks are a type of reconnaissance technique used to gather information about potential targets.

The answer choices are:

A: T1008-Fallback Channels
B: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks
C: T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information
D: T1074-Data Staged

Based on the CTI outline, the most likely technique used by Dropping Elephant to gather information about high-profile diplomatic and economic entities is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information, as it is related to reconnaissance and gathering information about potential targets.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

The CTI outline does not explicitly state the technique used before the Initial Access phase, but it mentions watering hole attacks, which are a type of reconnaissance technique. The question asks about the technique used before the Initial Access phase, and the answer choices are related to reconnaissance and gathering information. Based on this information, the most likely technique used by Dropping Elephant is T1589-Gather Victim Identity Information.

Final Answer: C
