**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence by a China-based attack group targeting military and aerospace interests in Russia and Belarus. The sequence involves:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.chm) file named 20160621.chm, which drops the ZeroT downloader.
2. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with Microsoft Word attachments exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
3. Initial Access: RAR archives and RAR SFX of ZeroT are used.
4. Command and Control (C2): ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography.
5. Command and Control (C2): ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when ZeroT transmitted system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons after retrieving stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the C2 phase of the attack, specifically the transmission of system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons. The relevant ATT&CK techniques are:

- T1071.003-Mail Protocols: This technique involves using email protocols to communicate with the C2 server, which is not directly related to the RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.
- T1556.007-Hybrid Identity: This technique involves using a combination of legitimate and malicious tools to create a false identity, which is not directly related to the RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.
- T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique involves using encryption to conceal C2 communication, which matches the description of RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.
- T1566-Phishing: This technique involves using social engineering to trick users into performing a specific action, which is not directly related to the RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. ZeroT retrieves stage-2 payloads via Bitmap URLs employing steganography (C2).
2. ZeroT transmits system information using RC4-encrypted HTTP POST beacons (T1573-Encrypted Channel).

The final answer is: **C: T1573-Encrypted Channel**
