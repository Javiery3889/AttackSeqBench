**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence related to Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on the XAgent app, a malware for iOS devices. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned in the outline is:

1. Initial Access (not explicitly mentioned as a tactic, but it's the starting point)
2. Execution (the XAgent app is installed and runs in the background)
3. Command and Control (the app sends and receives data via HTTP and FTP)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique used to collect geo-location data from the device after the XAgent app hides its icon and runs in the background on iOS 7.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is focused on the Command and Control phase, specifically on the collection of geo-location data. The relevant information from the CTI outline is that the app sends the information out via HTTP and uses POST requests to send messages. However, there is no explicit mention of geo-location data collection.

However, we can infer that the app is collecting data from the device, and it's likely that this data includes geo-location information. The question asks about the technique used to collect geo-location data, and the answer choices are related to data collection and manipulation.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning**

Based on the information provided, we can eliminate answer choices B and D, as they are not related to data collection. Answer choice A, T1132-Data Encoding, is also not relevant, as it's about encoding data, not collecting it.

The most plausible answer is C, T1614-System Location Discovery, as it's the only option that directly relates to collecting geo-location data from the device.

**Final Answer: C**
