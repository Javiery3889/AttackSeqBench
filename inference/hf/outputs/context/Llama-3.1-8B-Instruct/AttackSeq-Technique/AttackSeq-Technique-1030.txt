**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Gamaredon group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
2. Execution: Malicious DLLs, scripting (Batch files and VBScript), and user execution of email attachments
3. Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents
4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry key modifications, code signing, and deobfuscation
5. Discovery: Backdoors listing interesting files for future exfiltration
6. Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into documents and sending email with malicious attachments
7. Collection: Searching for sensitive documents and scanning drives for sensitive data
8. Command and Control: Using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique that occurred when Gamaredon's modules automatically uploaded harvested documents to the C&C server. The question focuses on the Collection phase, which involves searching for sensitive documents and scanning drives for sensitive data.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is related to the Collection phase, which involves searching for sensitive documents and scanning drives for sensitive data. The correct answer should be related to the technique used to upload the harvested documents to the C&C server.

* A: T1030-Data Transfer Size Limits is not directly related to uploading documents to the C&C server.
* B: T1137.006-Add-ins is related to injecting malicious macros into documents, which is a technique used in the Lateral Movement phase.
* C: T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel is the correct answer, as it involves uploading harvested documents to the C&C server using the command and control channel.
* D: T1106-Native API is not directly related to uploading documents to the C&C server.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the technique that involves uploading harvested documents to the C&C server using the command and control channel.

Final Answer: C
