**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Infamous Chisel malware. The relevant sections for this question are:

- Collection: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions. It also collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
- Command and Control: Infamous Chisel's db component provides SCP functionality, and td is deployed alongside the malware providing a Tor hidden service relaying connections to SSH program. The malware also provides a local Socks connection for db, and db provides a SSH server and client.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Collection
2. Command and Control

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the following sequence of TTPs:

1. Collection
2. Exfiltration using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections

The relevant ATT&CK technique for the exfiltration step is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the Infamous Chisel malware collects files from the local system and application directories (Collection) and then exfiltrates these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections (Command and Control). The correct answer choice is:

Final Answer: B
