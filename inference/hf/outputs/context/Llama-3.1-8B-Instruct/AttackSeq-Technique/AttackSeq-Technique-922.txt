**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Volatile Cedar attack sequence using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server
2. Execution: Exploiting the vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server
3. Execution: Using the Explosive Trojan with dynamically loaded DLL components
4. Persistence: Installing the Explosive Trojan with various service names and paths
5. Defense Evasion: Hiding from common detection tools and merging into surroundings
6. Credential Access: Gaining access to administrator passwords through keylogging
7. Lateral Movement: Spreading to the entire network using initially infected servers as a pivot
8. Command and Control: Using a multi-tiered server backend framework for control

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after conducting vulnerability scans and using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions vulnerability scans and the use of the Explosive Trojan with dynamically loaded DLL components. The relevant ATT&CK techniques in the CTI outline are:

* Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server (T1018)
* Execution: Exploiting the vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server (T1210)
* Execution: Using the Explosive Trojan with dynamically loaded DLL components (T1210)

The question specifically asks about spreading further into the target network after these steps. The relevant ATT&CK technique in the CTI outline is:

* Lateral Movement: Spreading to the entire network using initially infected servers as a pivot (T1021)

However, the question does not explicitly mention T1021. Instead, it asks about the technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network. Based on the CTI outline, the most likely technique is related to the initial exploitation of the vulnerability, which is:

* T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application

This technique is related to exploiting a vulnerability in a public-facing application, which is consistent with the initial vulnerability scan and exploitation described in the CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network after conducting vulnerability scans and using the Explosive Trojan for remote execution.
2. The relevant ATT&CK techniques in the CTI outline are Reconnaissance, Execution, and Lateral Movement.
3. The question specifically asks about spreading further into the target network, which is related to Lateral Movement.
4. However, the question does not explicitly mention T1021, but rather asks about the technique that allowed Volatile Cedar to spread further into the target network.
5. Based on the CTI outline, the most likely technique is related to the initial exploitation of the vulnerability, which is T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application.

**Final Answer: B**
