**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, an iOS malware, and its behavior on iOS 7 and iOS 8 devices. The key points are:

- Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background on iOS 7, hiding its icon and automatically restarting when terminated. On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.
- Command and Control: The malware sends information via HTTP (POST and GET requests), collects information from the iOS device, and uses a token to identify which module is communicating.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after executing the XAgent malware on iOS 7, where it hides the app icon and automatically restarts. The question focuses on the collection of information (contact lists, text messages, and Wi-Fi status) and its transmission via POST to the command and control server.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

To determine the correct sequence of TTPs, we need to match the attack sequence from the CTI outline with the details in the question. The key points are:

- The malware is installed on already compromised systems (Initial Access).
- The XAgent app runs in the background on iOS 7, hiding its icon and automatically restarting (Execution).
- The malware collects information from the iOS device and sends it via HTTP (Command and Control).

Given these points, the sequence of TTPs is likely:

1. Initial Access (malware installation)
2. Execution (XAgent app running in the background)
3. Command and Control (collection and transmission of information)

**Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices**

Based on the sequence of TTPs, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: T1057-Process Discovery - This technique involves discovering information about running processes, which is not directly related to the collection of information from the iOS device.

B: T1204-User Execution - This technique involves executing a binary or script on a target system, which is related to the Execution phase of the attack.

C: T1012-Query Registry - This technique involves querying the Windows registry, which is not relevant to the iOS device.

D: T1556.003-Pluggable Authentication Modules - This technique involves using a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) to authenticate, which is not related to the collection of information from the iOS device.

Considering the sequence of TTPs, the most likely technique that occurred before collected information was sent via POST to the command and control server is User Execution, as it is related to the Execution phase of the attack.

**Final Answer: B**
