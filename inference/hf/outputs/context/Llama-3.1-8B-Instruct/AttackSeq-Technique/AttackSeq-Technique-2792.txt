**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, which includes:

1. Initial Access: The malware is installed on already compromised systems, specifically iOS devices.
2. Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices but not on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The app collects various information from the compromised iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, Wi-Fi status, and more.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique used to facilitate communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests after gathering information from the compromised iOS device.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the communication aspect, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, we can infer that the malware needs to communicate with a C2 server to send the gathered information. The CTI outline mentions that the malware is similar to the SEDNIT malware, which suggests a potential connection to a C2 server.

The answer choices are:

A: T1557.002-ARP Cache Poisoning (not relevant to communication with a C2 server)
B: T1102-Web Service (involves communication with a web service, which could be a C2 server)
C: T1518-Software Discovery (involves discovering software, not communication with a C2 server)
D: T1001.001-Junk Data (involves sending junk data, not relevant to communication with a C2 server)

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs involves communication with a C2 server using POST and GET requests. The correct answer choice is the one that involves web service communication, which is likely used to send the gathered information to the C2 server.

Final Answer: B
