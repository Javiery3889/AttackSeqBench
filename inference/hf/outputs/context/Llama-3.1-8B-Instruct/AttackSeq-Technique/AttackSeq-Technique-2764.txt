**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack using Cobalt Strike, a paid penetration-testing tool used by malicious actors. The key points are:

- Initial Access: Cobalt Strike is used to deploy "Listeners" on victim machines, which determine how an infected host will reach out to the C2 server.
- Command and Control: The C2 server responds with a binary blob (beacon.dll) that is loaded via Reflective DLL injection.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence**

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access (T1204.001 - User Execution)
2. Command and Control (T1204.002 - User Execution is not explicitly mentioned, but the sequence is: T1204.001 - Initial Access -> T1204.002 - Command and Control)
   - T1204.002 is not explicitly mentioned, but the sequence is: T1204.001 - Initial Access -> T1204.002 - Command and Control)
   - The correct sequence is: T1204.001 - Initial Access -> T1204.002 - Command and Control)
   - T1204.002 is not explicitly mentioned, but the sequence is: T1204.001 - Initial Access -> T1204.002 - Command and Control)
