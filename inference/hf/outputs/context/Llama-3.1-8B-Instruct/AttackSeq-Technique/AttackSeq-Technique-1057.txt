**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Darkhotel APT. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The Darkhotel APT uses advanced reconnaissance capabilities to identify victims' locations and stay details.
2. Initial Access: The Darkhotel APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates.
3. Execution: The Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components that execute on victims' systems.
4. Persistence: The Darkhotel APT maintains persistence on compromised systems through the use of malware that adds autorun registry settings for automatic start during system boot.
5. Defense Evasion: The Darkhotel APT uses digital certificates to sign their backdoors and employs techniques to encrypt and store gathered data in log files.
6. Credential Access: The Darkhotel APT's information stealer module targets stored secrets in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and various email services.
7. Collection: The Darkhotel APT's keylogger module encrypts and stores gathered data in log files.
8. Command and Control: The Darkhotel APT maintains a web interface for victim management.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable the Darkhotel APT to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure that includes compromised commercial resources.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the technique used to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure. Based on the CTI outline, the relevant techniques are:

* T1584-Compromise Infrastructure (used to maintain persistence on compromised systems)
* T1573-Encrypted Channel (used to encrypt and store gathered data in log files)
* T1608.001-Upload Malware (used to upload malware to victims' systems)
* T1584.002-DNS Server (not directly related to maintaining a global and dynamic network infrastructure)

However, the most relevant technique that enables the Darkhotel APT to maintain a global and dynamic network infrastructure is T1584-Compromise Infrastructure, as it allows them to maintain persistence on compromised systems, which can be used to establish a network infrastructure.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
