**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CosmicDuke malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware deceives victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image file.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute its payload.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence on the system by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials.
5. Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
6. Collection: The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
7. Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that facilitates the transfer of collected information to remote servers after CosmicDuke collects sensitive information using tools like keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Command and Control phase of the attack, specifically the exfiltration of collected data to remote servers. Based on the CTI outline, the malware uses HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav servers for exfiltration.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question is about the exfiltration of collected data to remote servers.
2. The CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke uses HTTP GET requests and FTP/WebDav servers for exfiltration.
3. The answer choices are:
   A: T1025-Data from Removable Media (not relevant to exfiltration)
   B: T1590-Gather Victim Network Information (not relevant to exfiltration)
   C: T1020-Automated Exfiltration (not specific to the methods used by CosmicDuke)
   D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service (matches the methods used by CosmicDuke)
4. Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is D: T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service.

**Final Answer: D**
