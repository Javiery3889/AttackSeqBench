**Analysis of the CTI Outline:**

1. The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, specifically targeting Ukrainian power facilities using BlackEnergy 3 malware.
2. The attack sequence is as follows:
   - Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013's OLE packager (CVE-2014-4114).
   - Execution: Executing a Visual Basic macro embedded in an Excel document, which reassembles and executes a portable executable (PE32) named vba_macro.exe.
   - Persistence: Registering a binary to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function.
   - Defense Evasion: Using anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt() function calls, SetUnhandledExceptionFilter API, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent API.
   - Discovery: Gathering information for lateral movement using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.
   - Command and Control: Communicating with a command and control (C2) server using HTTP protocol.
   - Exfiltration: Sending gathered information to the C2 server.

**Analysis of the Question:**

1. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to enable lateral movement to other systems within the network after BlackEnergy 3 malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.

**Comparison and Evaluation:**

1. The question focuses on the Discovery phase of the attack, where the malware gathers information for lateral movement.
2. The correct ATT&CK technique for gathering network information is T1046-System Network Scanning.
3. However, the question asks about enabling lateral movement, which is a subsequent step.
4. The correct answer choice that enables lateral movement after gathering network information is T1021-Remote Services.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API (Discovery phase).
2. This information is used to enable lateral movement to other systems within the network.
3. The correct ATT&CK technique for enabling lateral movement is T1021-Remote Services.

**Final Answer: C: T1021-Remote Services**
