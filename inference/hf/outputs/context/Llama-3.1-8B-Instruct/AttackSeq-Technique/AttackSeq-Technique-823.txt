**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat group FIN4. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: FIN4 targets individuals with access to confidential information.
2. Resource Development: FIN4 organizes their targets using unique 'campaign codes' and transmits them to C2 servers along with stolen credentials.
3. Initial Access: FIN4 employs spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access to their targets' information.
4. Defense Evasion: FIN4 creates rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to delete emails containing suspicious keywords.
5. Command and Control: FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when FIN4 captured user credentials through spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Initial Access phase, where FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to capture user credentials. The relevant ATT&CK technique is related to capturing user credentials.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning**

A. T1528-Steal Application Access Token: This technique involves stealing an application access token, which is not directly related to capturing user credentials through spearphishing emails.

B. T1056-Input Capture: This technique involves capturing user input, such as credentials, which is the correct answer. FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to capture user credentials.

C. T1114.003-Email Forwarding Rule: This technique involves creating email forwarding rules, which is related to Defense Evasion, not Initial Access.

D. T1070-Indicator Removal: This technique involves removing security-related data, which is also related to Defense Evasion, not Initial Access.

**Final Answer: B**
