**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Emissary Panda (APT27) in a cyber attack. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Identifying vulnerable systems using tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
2. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
3. Execution: Uploading tools, including Mimikatz, and custom backdoors like HyperBro.
4. Persistence: Installing webshells, including the Antak webshell and China Chopper webshell, for persistence.
5. Credential Access: Dumping credentials using Mimikatz.
6. Discovery: Performing network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.
7. Lateral Movement: Moving laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
8. Command and Control: Using the HyperBro backdoor for command and control.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after uploading tools like Mimikatz for credential access. The answer choices are:

A: T1574.013-KernelCallbackTable
B: T1112-Modify Registry
C: T1564-Hide Artifacts
D: T1072-Software Deployment Tools

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the sequence of TTPs after credential access using Mimikatz. Based on the CTI outline, after credential access, the threat actors installed webshells, including the China Chopper webshell, for persistence. This suggests that the next step would be related to persistence.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after credential access using Mimikatz.
2. According to the CTI outline, after credential access, the threat actors installed webshells for persistence.
3. The China Chopper webshell is mentioned as one of the webshells installed for persistence.
4. Therefore, the next step in the sequence would be related to persistence.
5. Among the answer choices, T1564-Hide Artifacts is related to hiding artifacts, which is a technique that can be used to evade detection and maintain persistence.
6. However, the question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after credential access, and the correct answer should be related to persistence.
7. T1564-Hide Artifacts is not directly related to persistence, but it can be used to maintain persistence by hiding artifacts.
8. However, the correct answer is not T1564-Hide Artifacts, but rather a technique that is directly related to persistence.
9. The correct answer is T1072-Software Deployment Tools, which is related to installing software, including webshells, for persistence.

**Final Answer: D**
