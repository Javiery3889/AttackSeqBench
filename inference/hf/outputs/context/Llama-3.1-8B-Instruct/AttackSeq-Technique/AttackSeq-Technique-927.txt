**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Volatile Cedar attack sequence using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server
2. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server
3. Execution: Deploying the Explosive Trojan
4. Persistence: Installing the Explosive Trojan with various service names and paths
5. Defense Evasion: Hiding from common detection tools and merging into surroundings
6. Credential Access: Gaining access to administrator passwords through keylogging
7. Lateral Movement: Spreading to the entire network using initially infected servers and USB infection

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after Volatile Cedar leverages keylogging capabilities for credential access. The question is focused on the next step in the attack sequence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the next step after credential access. Based on the CTI outline, the next step after credential access is lateral movement. The question mentions connecting with multi-tiered server backend frameworks to control targeted systems, which aligns with the lateral movement phase.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

The question is asking about the next step after credential access, which is lateral movement. The correct answer should be related to the lateral movement phase. 

- Option A (T1190-Exploit Public-Facing Application) is incorrect because it is related to the initial access phase.
- Option B (T1497.001-System Checks) is incorrect because it is related to defense evasion, not lateral movement.
- Option C (T1001-Data Obfuscation) is incorrect because it is related to defense evasion, not lateral movement.
- Option D (T1071-Application Layer Protocol) is the most plausible answer because it is related to lateral movement and connecting with multi-tiered server backend frameworks.

Final Answer: D
