**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sophisticated malware system designed for data collection from individual computer systems. The malware system consists of three components: netsat.exe, netui3.dll, and winmgt.dll. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. **Initial Access**: The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives when reconnected to the system.
2. **Execution**: The malware operates as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The malware cleans up after itself by deleting key indicators of its presence and employs date sensitivity, deleting itself after a hardcoded date to avoid detection.
4. **Collection**: The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated via a custom XOR operation.
5. **Command and Control**: Command and control (C2) is accomplished via commands in an encrypted file stored on the local 'master' system.
6. **Exfiltration**: The means of exfiltration are not determined, but the data collection functionality of netsat.exe suggests that data for exfiltration might be collected by the 'master' system.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when the malware collected detailed information about system properties, such as IP addresses, platform details, and OS versions, during its reconnaissance phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the reconnaissance phase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline describes the malware collecting system information and files from connected systems and shared drives, which is likely part of the reconnaissance phase. The correct ATT&CK technique for collecting system information is **T1082-System Information Discovery**.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
