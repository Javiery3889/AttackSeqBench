**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install a webshell (AntSword).
2. Execution: Using the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz variant, Impacket's wmiexec and atexec tools).
3. Defense Evasion: Using a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
4. Credential Access: Dumping credentials from memory using Mimikatz and using Impacket tools to run commands on other systems using the pass the hash technique.
5. Discovery: Running commands for initial discovery on the system and network.
6. Command and Control: Using the AntSword webshell to communicate with the compromised server and run commands.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs when threat actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools for execution and dumped credentials using Mimikatz, and then used the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems in the network.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials and the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems. Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence is:

1. Credential Access: Dumping credentials from memory using Mimikatz.
2. Credential Access: Using Impacket tools to run commands on other systems using the pass the hash technique (which is related to using alternate authentication material).

The question asks what technique occurred after using the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems. The correct answer should be related to the use of alternate authentication material.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

C: T1137-Office Application Startup is not relevant to the scenario, as it involves using an Office application to gain access to a system, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

B: T1021.002-SMB/Windows Admin Shares is related to using SMB/Windows Admin Shares to access a system, but it is not directly related to using the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems.

A: T1087-Account Discovery is related to discovering user accounts, which is part of the Discovery phase, but it is not directly related to using the Impacket tool atexec to run commands on other systems.

C is not the correct answer because the question is asking about using alternate authentication material, which is related to using the pass the hash technique with Impacket tools.

However, the correct answer is not listed among the options. The correct answer is T1550-Use Alternate Authentication Material, which is related to using the pass the hash technique with Impacket tools.

Since the correct answer is not listed, I will choose the closest answer, which is:

Final Answer: C
