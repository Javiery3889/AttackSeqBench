**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors behind the Emissary Trojan. The relevant information for this question is:

- Initial Access: The threat actors compromised legitimate websites to host their malware.
- Persistence: The Emissary Trojan achieves persistence by writing itself to %SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain'.
- Defense Evasion: The Emissary Trojan authors made updates to evade detection, including changes in configuration storage, handling of commands, and the introduction of large file sizes to avoid antivirus scanning.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred after the Emissary Trojan achieved persistence by writing itself to %SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain,' and then communicated with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the Emissary Trojan communicating with its C2 servers using HTTP requests. This indicates that the technique used is related to communication with the C2 server. The relevant ATT&CK technique for communication with a C2 server using HTTP requests is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The Emissary Trojan achieved persistence by writing itself to %SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain.'
2. After achieving persistence, the Emissary Trojan communicated with its C2 servers using HTTP requests.
3. The ATT&CK technique for communication with a C2 server using HTTP requests is T1071-Application Layer Protocol.

Final Answer: B
