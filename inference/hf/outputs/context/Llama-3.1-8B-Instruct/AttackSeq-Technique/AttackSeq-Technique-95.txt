**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sequence of attack techniques used by APT Sidewinder:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file.
2. Execution: The HTA file executes a script that checks for installed antivirus software using WMI and proceeds to run a backdoor (FinalBot.exe) if not detected.
3. Defense Evasion: The HTA file avoids using PowerShell and employs VBS and DLL sideloading.
4. Discovery: The HTA file uses WMI to discover installed antivirus products.
5. Persistence: The backdoor establishes persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique used to send information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server using webserv-redir.net.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of techniques related to sending information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server. The relevant techniques from the CTI outline are:

1. Defense Evasion: The HTA file uses WMI to check for installed antivirus software.
2. Discovery: The HTA file uses WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

The question specifically asks about sending information about detected antivirus software to the C2 server. This implies a technique related to communication or data transmission.

**Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices**

A: T1090.003-Multi-hop Proxy - This technique is related to proxying traffic, which is not directly related to sending information about detected antivirus software.

B: T1082-System Information Discovery - This technique is related to discovering system information, which is consistent with the HTA file using WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

C: T1071-Application Layer Protocol - This technique is related to using application-layer protocols for C2 communication, which is not directly related to sending information about detected antivirus software.

D: T1556.007-Hybrid Identity - This technique is related to identity deception, which is not directly related to sending information about detected antivirus software.

**Step 5: Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to discovering system information (T1082) and sending that information to the C2 server. The correct answer choice is B: T1082-System Information Discovery.

Final Answer: B
