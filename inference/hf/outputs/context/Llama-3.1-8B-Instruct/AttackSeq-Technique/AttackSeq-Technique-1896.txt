**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Lateral Movement
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13 before staging data from network shared drives locally or remotely. The question specifically mentions the use of tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13 for lateral movement is:

1. Lateral Movement (using tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR)
2. Credential Access (to obtain credentials)
3. Discovery (to gather information on network and host configurations)
4. Exfiltration (to stage data from network shared drives locally or remotely)

The question specifically asks about the TTP that occurred after the group employed tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that occurs after Lateral Movement.

**Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices**

A: T1114.001-Local Email Collection - This technique is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
B: T1560-Archive Collected Data - This technique is a possible step after Credential Access, but it is not the most likely answer.
C: T1586.002-Email Accounts - This technique is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
D: T1132-Data Encoding - This technique is a possible step after Credential Access, but it is not the most likely answer.

However, considering the context of the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs would be:

Lateral Movement (T1197) -> Credential Access (T1555) -> Exfiltration (T1560)

Since the question asks about the TTP that occurred after the group employed tools like Invoke-WMIExec and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
