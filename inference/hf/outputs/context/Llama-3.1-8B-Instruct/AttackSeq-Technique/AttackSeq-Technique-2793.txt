**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence related to Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on an iOS malware. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned is:

1. Initial Access (not explicitly stated but implied as the malware is already installed)
2. Execution (the XAgent app is fully functional malware)
3. Discovery (the app collects sensitive information from the iOS device)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique used to send the collected information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix after collecting sensitive information from an iOS device.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the "Discovery" phase, where the malware collects sensitive information. The question specifically asks about sending the information out via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix. This implies the use of data encoding to transmit the collected data.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning**

- The question is about sending the collected information out, which is part of the "Discovery" phase.
- The technique mentioned in the question is data encoding, which is a common method for transmitting sensitive data.
- The options provided are:
  A: T1614-System Location Discovery (not relevant to sending data out)
  B: T1132-Data Encoding (matches the description of encoding data for transmission)
  C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting (involves hiding the true source of a request, not encoding data)
  D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools (involves compromising software dependencies, not encoding data)

**Final Answer: B**
