**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Shamoon malware attack, which involves the following sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The Shamoon malware was deployed against certain entities.
2. Execution: The malware executes a copy of itself as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and executes the entrenched file resulting in a dropped driver.
3. Persistence: Shamoon entrenches itself as a service on the infected system.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware overwrites data within the Documents and Settings folder, followed by the System32 folder, and then starts physical disk access to begin wiping at the disk level. It also overwrites the disk's boot records, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR), to prevent access to the affected file systems.
5. Command and Control: Fidelis researchers have developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware along the entire threat life cycle.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the next technique that executes after Shamoon malware overwrites the disk's boot records as part of its defense evasion strategy.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the destruction of target data on disks after the disk's boot records have been overwritten. Based on the CTI outline, the relevant part is the Defense Evasion section, which describes the malware's wiping function, including overwriting the disk's boot records and starting physical disk access to begin wiping at the disk level.

The correct answer choice should align with the destruction of target data on disks. Let's evaluate the options:

A: T1562-Impair Defenses - This technique is about disrupting or impairing the victim's ability to detect or respond to the attack, which is not directly related to the destruction of target data on disks.

B: T1485-Data Destruction - This technique involves destroying or deleting data on the victim's system, which aligns with the malware's wiping function described in the Defense Evasion section.

C: T1496.002-Bandwidth Hijacking - This technique involves intercepting or modifying network traffic, which is not related to the destruction of target data on disks.

D: T1484-Domain Policy Modification - This technique involves modifying the victim's domain policies, which is not related to the destruction of target data on disks.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the technique that involves destroying or deleting data on the victim's system, which is the next step after overwriting the disk's boot records.

Final Answer: B
