**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics and techniques used by the SideCopy APT group. The relevant information for this question is:

- **Exfiltration**: SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials from central Indian government employees. They commonly target Kavach, an MFA app used across India's government, and have deployed njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach.' They also use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred after SideCopy used njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the relevant information is that SideCopy used njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices. This indicates that the technique used is related to exfiltrating data from the infected devices.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

- The question asks for the technique that occurred after the exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases.
- The CTI outline mentions that SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting access credentials from central Indian government employees.
- The use of njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach' and GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases from infected devices is a form of automated exfiltration.
- Therefore, the most likely technique that occurred after the exfiltration is T1020-Automated Exfiltration.

Final Answer: D
