**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence of attack techniques is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: TeamTNT uses a new image, pause-amd64:3.4, to conduct reconnaissance and spread malware.
2. Initial Access: TeamTNT spreads their malware via exposed Docker API servers and uses an open Weave Scope service to gain access to the cluster.
3. Execution: The main payload, a coin miner, is executed after being downloaded and saved on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after executing the coin miner saved on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update. The question mentions that TeamTNT's script used iplogger.org to track the number of infected hosts and obtain their details.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the technique that occurred before TeamTNT's script used iplogger.org. Based on the CTI outline, the script used iplogger.org after the execution of the coin miner. However, the CTI outline does not directly mention the technique used before iplogger.org. We need to infer the correct answer based on the context.

The CTI outline mentions that the script scans for open Docker API endpoints using the masscan tool. This suggests that the script is actively scanning for open ports or services, which is a characteristic of the T1049-System Network Connections Discovery technique.

However, the question is asking about the technique that occurred before iplogger.org, which is likely related to tracking or gathering information about the infected hosts. The T1542.004-ROMMONkit technique is related to tracking or monitoring system information, but it is not directly related to the context of the question.

The T1595-Active Scanning technique is related to actively scanning for open ports or services, which is consistent with the script's use of masscan. However, this technique is not directly related to tracking or gathering information about infected hosts.

The T1087-Account Discovery technique is related to gathering information about user accounts, which is not directly related to the context of the question.

Based on the context and the information provided, the most plausible answer is B: T1049-System Network Connections Discovery, as it is the closest match to the script's behavior of actively scanning for open Docker API endpoints.
