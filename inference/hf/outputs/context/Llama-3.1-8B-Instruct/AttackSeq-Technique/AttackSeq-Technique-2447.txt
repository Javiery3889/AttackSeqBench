**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the DRAGONFISH threat group using the Elise malware. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to execute the malware.
2. Execution: Injecting the NavShExt.dll into the iexplore.exe process and calling the 'Setting' function.
3. Execution: Creating a mutex named 'donotbotherme' and storing harvested data in a file named thumbcache_1CD60.db.
4. Execution: Sending data to and downloading files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server with the IP address 103.236.150[.]14.
5. Persistence: Modifying the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
6. Defense Evasion: Employing various defense evasion techniques, including anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscation, and spoofing.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when the malware communicated with a hardcoded C2 server to send harvested data and receive commands.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the communication between the malware and the C2 server. Based on the CTI outline, this communication occurs during the Execution phase, specifically when the malware sends data to and downloads files and commands from the hardcoded C2 server with the IP address 103.236.150[.]14.

The relevant ATT&CK technique is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, which involves using a protocol to communicate with a C2 server.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique related to communication with a C2 server.
2. The CTI outline describes the malware sending data to and downloading files and commands from a hardcoded C2 server during the Execution phase.
3. The relevant ATT&CK technique is T1071-Application Layer Protocol, which involves using a protocol to communicate with a C2 server.
4. The other options do not match the described behavior: A is related to virtualization/sandbox evasion, B is related to services file permissions weakness, and C is related to non-standard ports.

**Final Answer: D**
