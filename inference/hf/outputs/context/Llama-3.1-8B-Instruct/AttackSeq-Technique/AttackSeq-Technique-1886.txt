**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Lateral Movement
10. Collection
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique that enabled the transfer of tools and communication within the network after staging data collected from network shared drives and archiving it with specific utilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is related to the Collection and Exfiltration phases of the attack sequence. The Collection phase involves staging data collected from network shared drives and archiving it with specific utilities. The Exfiltration phase involves exfiltrating data over web services.

The answer choices are:

A: T1090-Proxy
B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition
C: T1021-Remote Services
D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure

Based on the CTI outline, FIN13 uses various techniques for communication and tool transfer within the network. They employ web shells, custom malware, and legitimate utilities like certutil for detection evasion and tool transfer.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question is related to the Collection and Exfiltration phases, which involve data staging and transfer.
2. FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware for tool transfer and communication within the network.
3. The answer choices are evaluated as follows:
   - A: T1090-Proxy is a technique used for proxying traffic, which is not directly related to tool transfer and communication.
   - B: T1546.006-LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition is a technique used for loading dynamic link libraries, which is not directly related to tool transfer and communication.
   - C: T1021-Remote Services is a technique used for remote services, which is related to tool transfer and communication.
   - D: T1665-Hide Infrastructure is a technique used for hiding infrastructure, which is not directly related to tool transfer and communication.
4. Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is C: T1021-Remote Services, as it is related to remote services, which is used by FIN13 for tool transfer and communication within the network.

**Final Answer: C**
