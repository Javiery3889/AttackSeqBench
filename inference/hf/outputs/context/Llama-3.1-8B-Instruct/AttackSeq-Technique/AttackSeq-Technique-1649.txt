**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: PowerShell commands downloaded malicious payloads from URLs hosted on compromised servers.
2. Execution: PowerShell commands initiated the download of a malicious payload, which included a script targeting 64-bit systems.
3. Execution: The script checked the Windows version, applied hotfixes for vulnerabilities, and used PowerSploit to reflectively load an exploit bundle binary.
4. Persistence: The MSI package installed by PurpleFox ensured persistence by removing old installations and installing components of the PurpleFox backdoor.
5. Defense Evasion: PurpleFox used an MSI package to remove registry keys of old installations and installed a rootkit driver to hide its files, registry keys, and processes.
6. Defense Evasion: A .vbs script was executed to create a Windows firewall rule to block incoming connections on ports 135, 139, and 445.
7. Others: The FoxSocket backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel between the infected client and the server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred to establish a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers after PurpleFox evaded detection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions that PurpleFox evaded detection by using an MSI package to install a rootkit driver and block incoming connections via a firewall rule. The CTI outline states that the FoxSocket backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel between the infected client and the server.

Considering the attack sequence, the relevant part is the "Others" section, which describes the FoxSocket backdoor's capabilities, including bidirectional communication with the server.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that established a bidirectional communication channel with the C&C servers.
2. The CTI outline mentions the FoxSocket backdoor utilizing WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel.
3. The relevant ATT&CK technique for bidirectional communication is T1102-Web Service, which involves using a web service to establish a communication channel.
4. The other options do not match the described attack sequence: T1205-Traffic Signaling is related to traffic analysis, T1008-Fallback Channels is related to fallback plans, and T1014-Rootkit is related to hiding files and processes.

**Final Answer: A**
