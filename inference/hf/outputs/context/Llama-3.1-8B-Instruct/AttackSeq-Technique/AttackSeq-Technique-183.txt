**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Infamous Chisel malware. The relevant sections for this question are:

- Discovery: Infamous Chisel's netd component enumerates multiple data directories to discover files of interest, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers various system information such as the Android ID and other hardware information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network to discover other devices.
- Collection: Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions. It also collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred before Infamous Chisel used its netd component to enumerate multiple directories and perform IP scanning for system discovery. The question mentions scraping files containing sensitive data and deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the netd component of Infamous Chisel performs the following actions:

1. Enumerates multiple data directories to discover files of interest
2. Collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions
3. Performs IP scanning of the local network to discover other devices

The question mentions scraping files containing sensitive data and deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces. This implies that the technique involves collecting sensitive data and network traffic.

**Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices**

A: T1040-Network Sniffing - This technique involves intercepting and capturing network traffic, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

B: T1106-Native API - This technique involves using native APIs to interact with the system, which is not directly related to the actions described in the question.

C: T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks - This technique involves scanning IP addresses to discover devices on a network, which aligns with the IP scanning action described in the CTI outline.

D: T1555.001-Keychain - This technique involves accessing or manipulating keychain data, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Based on the analysis, the most likely ATT&CK technique that occurred before Infamous Chisel used its netd component to enumerate multiple directories and perform IP scanning for system discovery is T1595.001-Scanning IP Blocks.

**Final Answer: C**
