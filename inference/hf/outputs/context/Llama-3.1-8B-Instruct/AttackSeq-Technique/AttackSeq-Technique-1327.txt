**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CosmicDuke malware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening a PDF file containing an exploit or a Windows executable.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute the malware.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials.
5. Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
6. Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data.
7. Exfiltration: The information collected by the malware is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred when CosmicDuke gathered information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions that CosmicDuke uses Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when gathering information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.

Based on the CTI outline, the Discovery technique is mentioned in step 5, which involves searching for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns. However, the question specifically asks about gathering information from removable drives.

The correct answer choice is related to gathering information from removable media. 

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when gathering information from removable drives, skipping certain file types.
2. The CTI outline mentions that CosmicDuke uses Discovery techniques to identify targeted files on network and hard drives, including those with non-English encryption cipher-related names.
3. The question specifically asks about gathering information from removable drives, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.
4. However, the CTI outline does mention that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, which implies that it may also search for files on removable drives.
5. The correct answer choice is related to gathering information from removable media, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline but can be inferred from the Discovery technique.
6. Based on the process of elimination, the correct answer choice is D: T1025-Data from Removable Media.

Final Answer: D
