**Analysis of the CTI Outline:**

1. The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
   - Reconnaissance
   - Resource Development
   - Initial Access
   - Execution
   - Persistence
   - Defense Evasion
   - Credential Access
   - Discovery
   - Command and Control
   - Exfiltration

2. The sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question is:
   - Gathering information like system data and running processes
   - Capturing data specifically from removable media
   - Communicating with the C2 server to upload encrypted data

**Comparison and Evaluation:**

- The question asks about capturing data specifically from removable media after gathering information like system data and running processes. This matches the Discovery phase in the CTI outline, where Sayad collects a wide range of information from the compromised host, including system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies.
- The Discovery phase is the most relevant to the question, as it involves gathering information about the compromised host.
- The other phases mentioned in the question (capturing data from removable media and communicating with the C2 server) are not directly related to the Discovery phase but are part of the overall attack sequence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question asks about capturing data specifically from removable media after gathering information like system data and running processes.
2. The Discovery phase in the CTI outline involves gathering information about the compromised host, which includes system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies.
3. The Discovery phase is the most relevant to the question, as it involves gathering information about the compromised host.
4. The technique that most likely involved capturing data specifically from removable media as part of its collection activities is T1025-Data from Removable Media.

**Final Answer: B: T1025-Data from Removable Media**
