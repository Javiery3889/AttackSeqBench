**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Execution (using JSPRAT and passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE)
4. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate binaries with trojanized versions)
5. Privilege Escalation (using utilities like ProcDump and Mimikatz)
6. Defense Evasion (using passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities)
7. Credential Access (using process memory dumping and network sniffing)
8. Lateral Movement (using WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the technique that most likely occurred after using WMI to execute commands remotely for lateral movement, to gather information on network configuration and support FIN13's operational objectives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) being used for lateral movement. In the CTI outline, WMI is used for remote command execution and lateral movement (T1053.005). The question asks about gathering information on network configuration, which is related to the next step in the attack sequence.

The correct answer should be a technique that is related to gathering information on network configuration. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: T1016.001-Internet Connection Discovery (this technique is about discovering the presence of an internet connection, which is not directly related to network configuration)
B: T1505-Server Software Component (this technique is about discovering server software components, which is not directly related to network configuration)
C: T1016-System Network Configuration Discovery (this technique is about gathering information on network configuration, which aligns with the question)
D: T1078.001-Default Accounts (this technique is about identifying default accounts, which is not directly related to network configuration)

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the technique that is most closely related to gathering information on network configuration.

Final Answer: C
