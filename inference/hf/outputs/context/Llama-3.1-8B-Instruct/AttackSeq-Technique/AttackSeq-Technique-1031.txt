**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Kingslayer backdoor's behavior and its connection to the Codoso and Shell_Crew threat groups. Key points include:

- The Kingslayer backdoor employed a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to evade detection.
- The backdoor was signed with a stolen code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised between 09 April 2015 to 25 April 2015.
- The backdoor used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for command and control (C2).
- The Kingslayer backdoor was undetected by next-generation antivirus but was identified by RSA NetWitness Endpoint due to its floating code.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence in the Order Presented by the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**

The relevant attack sequence is:

1. **T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise**: The code signing private key was stolen from Alpha's software packaging system.
2. **Defense Evasion (Tactics not specified)**: The stolen code signing private key was used to sign the Kingslayer backdoor.
3. **Defense Evasion (Tactics not specified)**: The Kingslayer backdoor employed a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm to evade detection.

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely facilitated the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion before it employed a diurnal beacon sleep algorithm.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the initial deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments. The relevant part of the CTI outline is the compromise of the code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which is described as a **Supply Chain Compromise**.

**Step 5: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

The correct answer choice is the one that aligns with the initial deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

- **Step 1**: The question asks about the initial deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor.
- **Step 2**: The relevant attack sequence in the CTI outline is the compromise of the code signing private key from Alpha's software packaging system, which is described as a **Supply Chain Compromise**.
- **Step 3**: The correct answer choice must align with the initial deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments via a sophisticated software subversion.

**Final Answer: B**
