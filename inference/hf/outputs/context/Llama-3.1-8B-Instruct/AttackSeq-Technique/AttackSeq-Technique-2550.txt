**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Chinese APT group Deep Panda. The attack sequence involves:

1. **Resource Development**: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability to gain initial access.
3. **Execution**: Execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
4. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: The 2016 version of the Milestone backdoor creates a new administrator user and executes another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Use of a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
7. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
8. **Command and Control**: The Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server uncompressed and sends information about the current sessions on the system to the server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely ensured data exfiltration over the same communication channel after the Milestone backdoor communicated with a C2 server to send information about current sessions.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the Milestone backdoor communicating with a C2 server to send information about current sessions. This is related to the **Command and Control** technique described in the CTI outline. The question asks about the technique that ensured data exfiltration over the same communication channel.

Based on the CTI outline, the Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server uncompressed and sends information about the current sessions on the system to the server. This implies that data exfiltration could occur over the same communication channel.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server to send information about current sessions.
2. This communication channel is used for sending information, which implies that data exfiltration could occur over the same channel.
3. The correct ATT&CK technique for exfiltration over a C2 channel is T1041-Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is related to exfiltration over the C2 channel.

**Final Answer: C**
