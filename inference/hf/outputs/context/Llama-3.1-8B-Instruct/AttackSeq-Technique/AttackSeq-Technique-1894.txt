**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Lateral Movement
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after FIN13 utilized lateral movement methods such as WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE to access additional systems within the network.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions lateral movement, which is described in the CTI outline as step 9. The next step in the attack sequence after lateral movement is Command and Control (step 10). However, the question does not directly ask about Command and Control. Instead, it asks about the technique that occurred after lateral movement.

Considering the attack sequence, the next logical step after lateral movement would be Exfiltration (step 11), as the threat actor would need to exfiltrate data from the accessed systems. Exfiltration is the process of removing data from the compromised network, which aligns with the lateral movement described in the question.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence and the question, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Lateral Movement (FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE to access additional systems within the network)
2. Exfiltration (FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories to steal targeted data)

The correct answer choice is the one that corresponds to Exfiltration.

Final Answer: C
