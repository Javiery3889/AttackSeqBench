**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Discovery
9. Lateral Movement
10. Collection
11. Command and Control

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that occurred when FIN13 targeted web-accessible directories to steal staged data after collecting data from network shared drives and archiving it using various utilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Collection phase, where FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely. The question specifically mentions targeting web-accessible directories to steal the staged data.

Based on the CTI outline, the relevant techniques related to data collection and exfiltration are:

* Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
* Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.

The question specifically mentions targeting web-accessible directories, which is related to the Initial Access phase, where FIN13 exploited external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.

However, the question is asking about the technique that occurred after collecting data, which is during the Collection phase. The relevant technique is likely related to exfiltrating data over a web service.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
2. Exfiltration: FIN13 targets web-accessible directories to steal the staged data.

The ATT&CK technique that matches this sequence is T1567-Exfiltration Over Web Service.

Final Answer: A
