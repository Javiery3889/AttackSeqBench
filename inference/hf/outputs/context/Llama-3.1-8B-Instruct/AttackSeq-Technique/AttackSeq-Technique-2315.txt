**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying attack against the victim's remote services.
2. Execution: Installing Cobalt Strike beacon in memory using a PowerShell one-liner.
3. Persistence: Loading the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms.
4. Privilege Escalation: Starting a password spraying attack against domain admin accounts.
5. Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces from intrusions.
6. Credential Access: Achieving credentials access by brute force, credential stuffing, or password spraying.
7. Discovery: Applying a wide range of discovery tactics, including using PsLogList and Mimikatz.
8. Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities.
9. Collection: Collecting data from various sources within the victim's network.
10. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data using a custom-built tool to cloud storage web services.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK technique that most likely occurred after the adversary established C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike and then exfiltrated staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

The question mentions the following sequence of TTPs:

1. Establishing C2 communication through HTTPS encapsulation using a cracked trial version of Cobalt Strike.
2. Exfiltrating staged data using custom-built malware to supported cloud storage services.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question matches the Exfiltration phase, where the adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate data to cloud storage web services.

The correct answer choice should be related to the exfiltration of data. Let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: T1102.002-Bidirectional Communication - This technique is related to communication between the adversary and the C2 server, but it's not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

B: T1098.001-Additional Cloud Credentials - This technique is related to the use of cloud credentials, but it's not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

C: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter - This technique is related to the use of command and scripting interpreters, but it's not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

D: T1573-Encrypted Channel - This technique is related to the use of an encrypted channel for communication, which is consistent with the HTTPS encapsulation mentioned in the question. However, it's not directly related to the exfiltration of data.

However, the correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is actually T1020-Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, but this is not listed. The closest answer is T1573-Encrypted Channel, but this is not the correct answer.
