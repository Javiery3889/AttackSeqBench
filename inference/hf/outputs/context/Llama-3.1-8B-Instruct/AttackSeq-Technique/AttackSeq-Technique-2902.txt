**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the 'yty' framework's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The 'yty' framework uses a malicious Excel document 'Circular.xls' as part of its initial access strategy.
2. Execution: The framework includes a stripped-down C++ program (Downloader 1) and a more functional downloader (Downloader 2) that checks for a single instance and includes anti-sandbox detection.
3. Persistence: A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' establishes persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.
4. Defense Evasion: The framework employs evasion techniques such as mixing in junk code and basic anti-sandbox detection to avoid analysis.
5. Collection: The framework is capable of file collection, screenshots, and keylogging using plugins such as 'vstservice.exe', 'abode.exe', 'mdriver.exe', 'dspcheck.exe', and 'mboard.exe'.
6. Command and Control: The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise its traffic and downloads a file from Google Docs to get its C2 host.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the 'yty' framework used plugins such as 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots and 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering under the Collection tactic.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the 'yty' framework using plugins for taking screenshots and system information gathering. This corresponds to the Collection tactic, which is step 5 in the attack sequence. The next logical step after collecting data would be to exfiltrate it.

**Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices**

A: T1020-Automated Exfiltration - This technique involves the automated transfer of data from a system to an attacker-controlled location. Given that the 'yty' framework is capable of file collection, screenshots, and keylogging, it is likely that the next step would be to exfiltrate the collected data.

B: T1213-Data from Information Repositories - This technique involves accessing data from information repositories, which is not directly related to the 'yty' framework's capabilities.

C: T1048.001-Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol - This technique involves exfiltrating data over a symmetric encrypted protocol, but it is not the most likely next step after the 'yty' framework collects data.

D: T1542.003-Bootkit - This technique involves installing a bootkit, which is not related to the 'yty' framework's capabilities.

**Step 5: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. The 'yty' framework uses plugins for taking screenshots and system information gathering (Collection tactic).
2. The next logical step would be to exfiltrate the collected data.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
