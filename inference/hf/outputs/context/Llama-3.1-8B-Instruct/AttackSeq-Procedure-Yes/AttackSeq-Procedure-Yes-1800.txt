**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack sequence using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The key details are:

- **Tactic:** Command and Control
- **Action:** FireEye identified binaries coded to receive instructions from C2 servers, which instruct participating bots to attack Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum.
- **TTPs:**
  - W32 Cabinet self-extracting files drop a variant of the KernelBot DDoS tool.
  - The KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions from C2 servers hard-coded directly into the sample.
  - Two different single-byte XOR keys are used to encode configuration files issued by the DDoS C2 servers.
  - The encoded configuration file decodes to a set of instructions for the KernelBot network to attack various domains and IPs, primarily associated with Next Media or Apple daily websites, with the exception of a few IPs hosting the HKGolden forum.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure' after FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers in this campaign.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the following sequence of TTPs:
- FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers.
- The encoded configuration file decodes to a set of instructions for the KernelBot network to attack various domains and IPs.

Comparing this sequence with the CTI outline, we can see that the observed single-byte XOR keys are used to encode configuration files, which in turn instruct the KernelBot network to attack various domains and IPs, including those associated with Next Media and the HKGolden forum.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the observed single-byte XOR keys are used to encode configuration files that instruct the KernelBot network to attack various domains and IPs, including those associated with Next Media and the HKGolden forum. This suggests that the attackers are likely to launch Distributed Denial of Service attacks against these targets.

Given the context that the DDoS attacks are linked to previously observed APT activity, including Operation Poisoned Hurricane, and the use of digital certificates previously used by APT actors, it is plausible that the attackers are interested in disrupting anti-government activists in China, which may include websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong.

Therefore, it is likely that the attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'.

**Final Answer: A**
