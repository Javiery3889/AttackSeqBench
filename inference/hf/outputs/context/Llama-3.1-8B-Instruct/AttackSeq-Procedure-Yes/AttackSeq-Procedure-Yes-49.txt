**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The campaign's goal is to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to target systems.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Defense Evasion**: A PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether it is likely that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly corresponds to the **Initial Access** and **Defense Evasion** phases of the attack sequence. The question mentions the execution of a PowerShell script via a VBS macro, which is consistent with the **Defense Evasion** phase. The question also asks about the download of payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware, which is consistent with the **Command and Control** phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, it is clear that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware. The **Defense Evasion** phase involves the execution of a PowerShell script in memory, which is used to download payloads. The **Command and Control** phase involves the communication with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads.

Therefore, the answer to the question is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
