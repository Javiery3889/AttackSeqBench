**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CosmicDuke malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: Social engineering and document-based exploits to deceive victims into opening a malicious PDF file or executable.
2. Execution: The malware uses a loader to execute the malware, which is similar to the MiniDuke loader.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
4. Credential Access: The malware targets various software to steal credentials, including Windows credentials, software credentials, and certificates.
5. Discovery: The malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
6. Command and Control: The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware.
7. Exfiltration: The information collected by the malware is automatically uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP after searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention the use of a clipboard stealer as part of the CosmicDuke's TTPs. However, it does mention that the malware searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns in the discovery phase. The question specifically asks about the discovery phase, but it does not provide any information about the malware using a clipboard stealer.

Based on the provided information, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the discovery phase, but the CTI outline does not mention the use of a clipboard stealer in this phase.
2. The CTI outline describes the malware's TTPs, but a clipboard stealer is not mentioned.
3. The question does not provide any information that would suggest the use of a clipboard stealer.
4. Based on the provided information, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP.

**Final Answer: B**
