**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Inception attackers, which includes:

1. Reconnaissance: Spear phishing to gather information.
2. Initial Access: Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to gain access.
3. Execution: Deploying POWERSHOWER, a PowerShell backdoor.
4. Persistence: Setting up persistence by writing to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.
5. Defense Evasion: Using anti-forensics techniques and a basic backdoor (POWERSHOWER).
6. Discovery: POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server, it will likely communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, after POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server, it is likely that it will communicate with the C2 server. This is because the Discovery phase is followed by the Command and Control phase, which involves maintaining communication between the infected machine and the C2 server.

POWERSHOWER is a backdoor that allows the attackers to upload information to the C2 server and potentially run a secondary payload. This suggests that POWERSHOWER is designed to maintain a connection with the C2 server, allowing the attackers to receive further instructions and data.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, which includes the Discovery phase where POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.
2. The Discovery phase is followed by the Command and Control phase, which involves maintaining communication between the infected machine and the C2 server.
3. POWERSHOWER is a backdoor that allows the attackers to upload information to the C2 server and potentially run a secondary payload.
4. Based on this information, it is likely that POWERSHOWER will communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A**
