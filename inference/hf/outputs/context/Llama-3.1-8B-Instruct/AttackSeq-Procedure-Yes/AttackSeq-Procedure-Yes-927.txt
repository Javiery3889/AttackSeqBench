**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Volatile Cedar attack sequence using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server
2. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server
3. Execution: Deploying the Explosive Trojan, which contains a main executable binary and a DLL file
4. Persistence: Installing the Explosive Trojan with various service names and paths
5. Defense Evasion: Hiding from common detection tools and merging into surroundings
6. Credential Access: Leveraging keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords
7. Lateral Movement: Spreading to the entire network using the initially infected servers as a pivot

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Volatile Cedar campaign will use a multi-tiered server backend framework, including static and dynamic update servers, for command and control after leveraging its keylogging capabilities to extract administrator passwords.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Credential Access tactic, which is step 6 in the attack sequence. The question asks about the next step after gaining access to administrator passwords. The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No.

Based on the CTI outline, after gaining access to administrator passwords, the attackers will likely use the Lateral Movement tactic (step 7) to spread to the entire network using the initially infected servers as a pivot. There is no mention of a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control in the CTI outline.

However, the CTI outline does mention that the Explosive Trojan contains a DLL file with backend API calls, which could be used for command and control. But this is not explicitly stated as a multi-tiered server backend framework.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the attackers will use the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network, rather than setting up a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
