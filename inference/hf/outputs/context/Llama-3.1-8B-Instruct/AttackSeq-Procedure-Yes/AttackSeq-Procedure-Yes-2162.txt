**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of APT35, a threat actor, as follows:

1. Initial Access: APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
2. Persistence: The infected device exhibited persistent command and control (C2) beaconing.
3. Command and Control: Darktrace detected APT35's C2 activity.
4. Discovery: Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst analyzed the infected device once the C2 was detected.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the Command and Control detection occurred before the Discovery phase, where Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst analyzed the infected device. This implies that the analysis of the infected device was a direct result of the Command and Control detection.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the sequence of events in the CTI outline, it is clear that the Command and Control detection preceded the Discovery phase, where Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst analyzed the infected device. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the analysis of the infected device was indeed automated following the Command and Control detection.

Final Answer: A
