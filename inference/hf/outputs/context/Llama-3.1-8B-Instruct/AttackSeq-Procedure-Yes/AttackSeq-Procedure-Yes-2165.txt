**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sequence of attack tactics and techniques (TTPs) used by the NetTraveler APT group:

1. Initial Access: The attackers use a spear-phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to drop the main module "net.exe".
2. Persistence: The malware installs a main C&C module, "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL", by registering it as a service named "Windowsupdata" through a Windows Batch file "DOT.BAT".
3. Command and Control: The malware communicates with C&C servers such as "uyghurinfo[.]com".

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers such as "uyghurinfo[.]com" through decryption using a provided algorithm.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention the use of encryption or decryption schemes by the NetTraveler malware. However, it does describe the malware's persistence mechanism, which involves registering the main C&C module as a service and using mutexes to prevent multiple instances. The question asks about the use of encryption to obfuscate the configuration, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

Given the information provided, there is no indication that the NetTraveler malware uses encryption or decryption schemes to obfuscate its configuration. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
