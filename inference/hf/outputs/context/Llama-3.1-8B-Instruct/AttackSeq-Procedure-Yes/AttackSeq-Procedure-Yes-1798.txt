**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) through a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).
2. Execution: Deploying a malware payload (Rdws.exe) via a DLL sideloading technique, which loads a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) and a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
3. Defense Evasion: Using a sideloading technique to evade defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
4. Defense Evasion: Connecting back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain "pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org" during command and control communication after using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure, as part of the Defense Evasion tactic. This indicates that the malware did indeed connect back to the exploit domain as part of its command and control communication.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the malware connected back to the exploit domain as part of its command and control communication. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain "pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org" during command and control communication.

Final Answer: A
