**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT41 in a cyber attack. The sequence of attack is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities targeting call record information and hotel reservation systems.
2. Initial Access: APT41 uses spear-phishing emails with attachments to initially compromise victim organizations.
3. Execution: APT41 deploys various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits, to execute their operations within compromised systems.
4. Persistence: APT41 deploys rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits to maintain persistence on select victim systems.
5. Credential Access: APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials within compromised systems.
6. Discovery: APT41 moves laterally within networks to discover and access game production environments.
7. Lateral Movement: APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks to access game production environments.
8. Collection: APT41 collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments.
9. Impact: APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and attempts to deploy ransomware in the video game industry.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether APT41 will deploy Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits to maintain persistence before leveraging malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access compromised systems.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that APT41 deploys rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence on select victim systems (step 4). This is done as an added layer of stealth for defense evasion, as the bootkits execute before the operating system initializes. This step is executed before the credential access step (step 5), where APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials within compromised systems.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, it is clear that APT41 deploys MBR bootkits as part of their persistence mechanism, which is executed before accessing credentials within compromised systems. Therefore, it is likely that APT41 will deploy MBR bootkits before leveraging malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers.
