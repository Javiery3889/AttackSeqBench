**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, social media data collection, and analysis for future targeting.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, and install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
3. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled Command-and-Control (C2) server.
4. Impact: The malware is delivered to the targeted network, but not installed. Installation requires employees to actively grant permission to the embedded VBA scripts to execute.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of events is:

1. Reconnaissance (Step 1)
2. Initial Access (Step 3)
3. Command and Control (Step 5)

The question specifically asks about the communication between malicious implants and C2 servers after installation through macro execution. According to the CTI outline, after the malware is installed (Step 3: Initial Access), the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server (Step 5: Command and Control).

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of events indicates that after the malware is installed through macro execution, it will establish communication with the C2 server.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
