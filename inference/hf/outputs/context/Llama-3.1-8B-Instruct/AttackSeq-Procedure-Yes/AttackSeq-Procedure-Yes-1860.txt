**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign by the MenuPass threat actor using the QuasarRAT backdoor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Execution**: QuasarRAT loader arrives as a 64-bit service DLL, using CppHostCLR to decrypt, load, and invoke an embedded .NET assembly in-memory.
2. **Execution**: The .NET assembly is obfuscated with ConfuserEx and is responsible for decrypting and executing a separate malicious .NET module stored in the %WINDOWS%\Microsoft.NET directory.
3. **Execution**: The final payload assembly is stored as an encrypted file under the Microsoft.NET Framework directory and is decrypted and loaded in-memory as "Client".
4. **Persistence**: The QuasarRAT backdoor achieves persistence by installing the RAT as a service, known as DILLJUICE, in later variants.
5. **Defense Evasion**: The QuasarRAT loader uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether QuasarRAT will communicate with a command and control (C2) server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the encryption method used for C2 communication. However, it does mention that the threat actor added a custom connectivity check to the backdoor, which implies that the backdoor may use a specific method to establish a connection to the C2 server. The question asks about AES-128 encryption, which is not mentioned in the CTI outline.

However, the CTI outline does mention that the QuasarRAT payload is encrypted and stored under the Microsoft.NET directory, and the .NET loader is obfuscated with ConfuserEx. This suggests that the threat actor uses encryption and obfuscation techniques to evade detection, but it does not provide information about the encryption method used for C2 communication.

Given the lack of information about the encryption method used for C2 communication, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether QuasarRAT will communicate with a C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels.

However, considering the context of the question and the fact that the threat actor uses various encryption and obfuscation techniques to evade detection, it is likely that they would use a similar encryption method for C2 communication. But since the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the encryption method used for C2 communication, we cannot confirm this with certainty.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, we cannot determine with certainty whether QuasarRAT will communicate with a C2 server using AES-128 encrypted channels. However, considering the context of the question and the fact that the threat actor uses various encryption and obfuscation techniques to evade detection, it is possible that they would use a similar encryption method for C2 communication.

Since the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the encryption method used for C2 communication, we cannot confirm this with certainty. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
