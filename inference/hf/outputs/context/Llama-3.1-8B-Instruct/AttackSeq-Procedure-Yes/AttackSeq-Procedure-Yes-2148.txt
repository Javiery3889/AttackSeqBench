**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The key details are:

- Initial Access: Phishing campaigns targeting U.S. utility providers with PE attachments and later with malicious macro-laden Microsoft Word documents.
- Execution: The FlowCloud macro renames files, saves them as a portable executable file named 'gup.exe', and executes it using a version of certutil.exe named 'Temptcm.tmp'.
- Command and Control: FlowCloud malware handles configuration updates, file exfiltration, and commands as independent threads utilizing a custom binary C2 protocol.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the Execution tactic where the FlowCloud macro renames files and executes 'gup.exe' using a version of certutil.exe (Temptcm.tmp).

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question asks if the FlowCloud malware will execute 'Gup.exe', which in turn executes 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention 'EhStorAuthn.exe' or the specific sequence of execution after 'gup.exe'. However, it does mention that the FlowCloud macro introduced a new method for the delivery of the malware, utilizing a previously unobserved macro section to download the payload from a DropBox URL. This suggests that the malware may continue to execute and download additional components.

Given the information provided, it is plausible that 'gup.exe' could be a payload or a component of the malware that continues to execute and download additional components, including 'EhStorAuthn.exe'. However, the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the specific sequence of execution after 'gup.exe'.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine with certainty if 'Gup.exe' will execute 'EhStorAuthn.exe' to extract and install payload file components for persistence. However, considering the context of the attack and the fact that 'gup.exe' is executed by the FlowCloud macro, it is plausible that 'gup.exe' could be a component of the malware that continues to execute and download additional components.

Since the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the specific sequence of execution after 'gup.exe', and the question does not provide enough context to determine the correct answer with certainty, the most conservative answer would be to choose the option that does not confirm the execution of 'EhStorAuthn.exe' by 'Gup.exe'.

**Final Answer: B**
