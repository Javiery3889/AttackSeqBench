**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Gamaredon group, a threat actor. The outline is organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The group uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access to the target's system.
2. Execution: They employ scripting, use rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, and rely on user execution of malicious email attachments for initial compromise.
3. Persistence: The group registers modules as scheduled tasks, uses Registry Run keys and the Startup folder, and inserts malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
4. Defense Evasion: They use obfuscated files, modify registry keys, employ code signing with valid certificates, and deobfuscate and decrypt strings in their modules.
5. Discovery: The group's backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration.
6. Lateral Movement: They inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and use Outlook VBA macros to send email with malicious attachments to other targets.
7. Collection: The malware searches for sensitive documents, scans drives, and takes screenshots every minute.
8. Exfiltration: The modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Gamaredon's malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C2) communication before transferring harvested documents to the C&C server for exfiltration.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communication. However, it does mention that the group uses a C&C server for exfiltration, which implies some form of communication between the malware and the C&C server.

Given the context, it is likely that the malware will use some form of communication protocol to interact with the C&C server. However, the CTI outline does not provide specific information about the protocols used.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided, we can infer that the malware will likely use some form of communication protocol to interact with the C&C server. However, the CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

Since the question asks about the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols specifically, and the CTI outline does not provide information about these protocols, we cannot conclusively determine whether the malware will use them.

However, considering the group's use of a C&C server for exfiltration, it is likely that they will use some form of communication protocol. Given the lack of information about specific protocols, we cannot definitively say that they will use HTTP and HTTPS.

Therefore, the most conservative answer would be to say that it is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline that they will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

**Final Answer: B**
