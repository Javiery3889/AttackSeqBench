**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Taidoor malware campaign, which includes the following attack sequence:

1. Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing email sent to targets.
2. Initial Access: The email attachment exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware onto the target's system.
3. Execution: The Taidoor malware beacons to a command-and-control (CnC) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
4. Defense Evasion: The new variant uses a downloader to retrieve encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw after avoiding detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the Taidoor malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern. Although it does not specifically mention the CnC servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw, it does mention a similar CnC naming scheme between Taidoor and Taleret, another malware family. This suggests that the CnC servers may be related to the Taidoor campaign.

Given the new variant's ability to avoid detection by using a downloader, it is likely that it will still communicate with the CnC servers to receive further instructions or updates.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the reasoning is as follows:

1. The Taidoor malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
2. The new variant uses a downloader to retrieve encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware.
3. The CnC servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw may be related to the Taidoor campaign based on the similar CnC naming scheme with Taleret.
4. The new variant will likely communicate with the CnC servers to receive further instructions or updates.

Final Answer: A
