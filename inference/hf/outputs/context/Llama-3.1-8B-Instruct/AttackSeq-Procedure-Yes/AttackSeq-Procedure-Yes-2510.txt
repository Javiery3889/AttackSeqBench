**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the GreyEnergy group's initial access methods, which include:

1. Compromising a public-facing web service to gain access to the internal network.
2. Using spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to drop the "GreyEnergy mini" backdoor.

After initial access, the attackers use GreyEnergy mini to:

1. Map the network.
2. Collect passwords to obtain domain administrator privileges.

The tools used for these tasks are Nmap and Mimikatz.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network after compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools. However, it does mention the use of fairly standard tools for tasks such as mapping the network and collecting credentials. SysInternals PsExec and WinExe are tools that can be used for lateral movement and executing commands on remote systems, which aligns with the GreyEnergy group's goal of controlling the whole network.

Given the context, it is plausible that the GreyEnergy group would use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network, as these tools are commonly used for such tasks.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The GreyEnergy group uses GreyEnergy mini to compromise a computer and then uses Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials.
2. The goal of the attackers is to obtain domain administrator privileges to control the whole network.
3. SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools are commonly used for lateral movement and executing commands on remote systems, which aligns with the GreyEnergy group's goal.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network.

**Final Answer: A**
