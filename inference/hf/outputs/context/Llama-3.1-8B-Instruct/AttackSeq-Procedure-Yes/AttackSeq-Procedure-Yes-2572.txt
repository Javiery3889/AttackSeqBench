**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics as follows:

1. Initial Access: The attack starts with a suspicious email from a domain that was registered through a Panama company and resolves to a VPS hosting provider in the Netherlands. The email contains a Word document with a macro dropper designed to execute a JavaScript payload.
2. Execution: The Word document contains VBA-Macro functions that decode a JavaScript payload, which is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The payload communicates with an IP address assigned to Frontier Communications Solutions.
3. Defense Evasion: The attacker uses obfuscation techniques in the VBA-Macro to decode the JavaScript payload, making analysis more challenging.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the likelihood of the JavaScript downloader dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the following sequence of TTPs:

1. Utilizing obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads
2. Dropping a file into the system's temporary directory
3. Dropping a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL
4. 'surprise.php' revealing its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe

Comparing this sequence with the CTI outline, we can see that the first two points match the Defense Evasion and Execution tactics described in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline does not provide information about the specific file name 'nanagrams.exe' or the 'surprise.php' URL.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, we can infer that the attack involves the use of obfuscated VBA-Macro functions to decode JavaScript payloads and drop a file into the system's temporary directory. However, the CTI outline does not provide specific information about the file name 'nanagrams.exe' or the 'surprise.php' URL.

Given the lack of information about the specific file name and URL, we cannot confirm that the JavaScript downloader will drop a file named 'nanagrams.exe' from a URL while 'surprise.php' reveals its source code showing visitor tracking through an iframe. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
