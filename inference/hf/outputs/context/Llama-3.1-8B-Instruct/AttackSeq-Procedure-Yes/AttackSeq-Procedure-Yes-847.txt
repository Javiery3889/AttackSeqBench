**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the phases of a cyber attack in the order they occur:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase, specifically whether attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The discovery phase is followed by the collection phase, as described in the CTI outline. However, the question asks about the sequence of TTPs after discovery, which is not explicitly stated in the CTI outline. We can infer that the question is asking about the next logical step after discovery.

Based on the CTI outline, after discovery, the attackers would likely proceed to collection, as they need to gather relevant data. However, the question specifically asks about lateral movement, which is more closely related to the execution and privilege escalation phases.

Given the options, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:

A: Yes - This option suggests that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points. This is a plausible sequence of TTPs, as attackers often use lateral movement to spread within the network before establishing persistence.

B: No - This option suggests that attackers will not exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points. This is less likely, as lateral movement is often a necessary step before establishing persistence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the discovery phase is to exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points. This is because lateral movement is often a necessary step before establishing persistence.

Final Answer: A
