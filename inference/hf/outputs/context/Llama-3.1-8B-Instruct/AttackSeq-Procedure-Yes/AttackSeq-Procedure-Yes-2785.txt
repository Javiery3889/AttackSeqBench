**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, which includes:

1. Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
2. Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices but not on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the malicious XAgent app will exfiltrate collected data via HTTP requests while communicating with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can infer that the XAgent app is designed to collect sensitive information from iOS devices. The question asks about the exfiltration of this data via HTTP requests. Given the context, it is likely that the app would need to send the collected data back to its C&C server for further analysis or action.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The XAgent app is designed to collect sensitive information from iOS devices, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
2. The app needs to send this collected data back to its C&C server for further analysis or action.
3. The question mentions that the app communicates with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.
4. Given the context, it is likely that the app would exfiltrate the collected data via HTTP requests to its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A**
