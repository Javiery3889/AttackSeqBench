**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Agrius. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications (CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection) to gain initial access.
2. Persistence: Deploying webshells and registering the custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service on compromised systems.
3. Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to evade defenses.
4. Lateral Movement: Utilizing webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement.
5. Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers over HTTP, awaiting commands for updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.
6. Impact: Deploying wipers (Apostle and DEADWOOD) to destroy data on targeted systems.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized to exfiltrate data to C2 servers as part of its execution functionality after exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells and using RDP for lateral movement.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of TTPs involving the exploitation of public-facing applications, uploading webshells, and using RDP for lateral movement. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is mentioned in the context of Command and Control, where it communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.

Based on the CTI outline, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for communication with C2 servers, which includes sending recon information and downloading files. However, the specific action of exfiltrating data to C2 servers is not explicitly mentioned as a functionality of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the information in the CTI outline, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is primarily used for communication with C2 servers, but the specific action of exfiltrating data is not explicitly mentioned. However, the backdoor does await commands from C2 servers, which could potentially include data exfiltration. Considering the context, it is plausible that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor could be utilized for data exfiltration as part of its execution functionality.

However, the CTI outline does not explicitly state that data exfiltration is a functionality of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is that it is not explicitly stated that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor would be utilized for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: B
