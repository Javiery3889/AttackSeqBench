**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
2. Execution: User Execution (T1204)
3. Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214)
4. Collection: Data from Local System (T1005)
5. Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
6. Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files after executing hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of events after executing hidden objects in an Excel document exploiting CVE-2017-11882. The CTI outline mentions that the dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys, using techniques such as T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry). However, it does not explicitly mention the use of T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for credentials.

Given the context, it is likely that the attack will not hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files. The attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not indicate that the threat actor used T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) as part of the credential access phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
