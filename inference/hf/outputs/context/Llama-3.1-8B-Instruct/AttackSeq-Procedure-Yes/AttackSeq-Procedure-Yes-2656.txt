**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Mustang Panda campaign using the Korplug variant. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document to distract the victim.
2. Execution: A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable to execute the Korplug variant.
3. Persistence: Korplug establishes persistence by creating a directory under %allusersprofile% and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry to run at boot.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware uses control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques at every stage of the deployment process.
5. Discovery: Korplug collects system information, including metadata and content from local systems and removable media.
6. Command and Control: Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
7. Exfiltration: Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions gathering data from network shared drives, which is related to the Discovery phase of the attack sequence. The Discovery phase involves collecting system information, including metadata and content from local systems and removable media. The question then asks about data exfiltration, which is the next phase in the attack sequence.

Based on the attack sequence, it is likely that after gathering data from network shared drives, the Korplug malware will proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The Korplug malware gathers data from network shared drives during the Discovery phase.
2. The next phase in the attack sequence is Exfiltration, which involves sending the collected data to the C&C server.
3. The Exfiltration phase uses the same custom protocol as the Command and Control phase, which is an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Korplug malware will proceed with data exfiltration via the encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

**Final Answer: A**
