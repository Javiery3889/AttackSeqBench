**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Elderwood Project attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The key points are:

- The attackers have established command and control (C&C) servers to control compromised systems.
- The C&C servers are used to retrieve commands from the attackers and maintain control over the victim's computer.
- The attackers use an Elderwood platform to deploy zero-day exploits.
- The attackers have been linked to the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Elderwood Project attackers will establish C&C servers after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline states that the attackers have established C&C servers to control compromised systems. This indicates that the attackers do use C&C servers as part of their TTPs. The question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks. Given the information in the CTI outline, it is likely that the attackers will establish C&C servers after gaining initial access via watering hole attacks to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.
2. The CTI outline states that the attackers have established C&C servers to control compromised systems.
3. This indicates that the attackers use C&C servers as part of their TTPs.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will establish C&C servers after deploying zero-day exploits via watering hole attacks.

**Final Answer: A**
