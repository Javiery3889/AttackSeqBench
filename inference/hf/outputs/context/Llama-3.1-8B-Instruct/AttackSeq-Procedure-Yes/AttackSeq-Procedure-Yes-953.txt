**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Sednit group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing email campaign with shortened URLs delivering the first stage of Zebrocy components.
2. Execution: The operators took control of the backdoor, sending commands to gather system information, network scanning, and executing system commands.
3. Execution: The operators used a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader, written in C++, which then downloaded a Delphi backdoor.
4. Persistence: The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence, adding registry keys for a custom backdoor.
5. Defense Evasion: The malware deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
6. Credential Access: The operators uploaded and used dumpers to target browsers and versions of Microsoft Outlook.
7. Collection: The malware scanned for files matching specific extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media.
8. Command and Control: The downloaders and backdoors communicated with the C&C server using commonly used ports.
9. Exfiltration: Data were automatically prepared and sent to the C&C server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files matching specific extensions on local and network drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline shows that the Sednit group's attack sequence involves gathering system information and executing system commands (Tactic: Execution) before scanning for files matching specific extensions (Tactic: Collection). This suggests that the group would gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the Sednit group is likely to gather information about the victim's computer and environment before scanning for files matching specific extensions on local and network drives.

1. The operators took control of the backdoor and sent commands to gather system information and execute system commands (Execution).
2. This information gathering would provide the necessary context for the subsequent scanning of files.
3. The malware would then scan for files matching specific extensions on the local system, network shared drives, and removable media (Collection).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
