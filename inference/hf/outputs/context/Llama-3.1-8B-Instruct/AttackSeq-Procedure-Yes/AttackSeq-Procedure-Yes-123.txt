**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Agrius. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications using publicly available exploits (CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection).
2. Execution: Deploying custom malware, including the '.NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper', for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. Persistence: Registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service for persistence and deploying webshells.
4. Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor's self-updating and deletion functionality.
5. Lateral Movement: Tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement.
6. Command and Control: Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP through the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the likelihood of Agrius deploying the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Command and Control phase, where the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers. The question asks about the deployment of the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after this phase.

Based on the CTI outline, the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for data exfiltration, additional malware deployment, and other activities. However, there is no mention of the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware being deployed during this phase or any other phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the information in the CTI outline, there is no indication that the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware are deployed during the Command and Control phase or at any other point in the attack sequence. The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is used for various activities, but the deployment of these specific malware is not mentioned.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Agrius is not likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' awaits commands from C2 servers.

**Final Answer: B**
