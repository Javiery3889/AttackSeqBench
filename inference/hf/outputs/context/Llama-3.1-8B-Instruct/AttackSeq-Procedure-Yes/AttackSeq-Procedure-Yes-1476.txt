**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Compromising a website and exploiting CVE-2018-8174 to download a DLL.
2. Execution: The DLL is run in PowerShell, which checks for antivirus software and exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
3. Persistence: The SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to ProgramData\update\ and creating a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName.
4. Privilege Escalation: The downloader exploits the CVE-2015-1701 vulnerability to acquire Local Privilege Escalation.
5. Defense Evasion: The first stage downloader exits if it detects any antivirus software processes.
6. Collection: The backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website.
7. Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.
8. Exfiltration: The attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. This suggests that the backdoor has the capability to collect information about the system, including the username and computer name.

Given the attack sequence, it is likely that the backdoor would retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to ProgramData\update\ and creating a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName.
2. This suggests that the backdoor has already established a foothold on the system.
3. As part of its discovery tactics, the backdoor is likely to collect information about the system, including the username and computer name.
4. The backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor will retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
