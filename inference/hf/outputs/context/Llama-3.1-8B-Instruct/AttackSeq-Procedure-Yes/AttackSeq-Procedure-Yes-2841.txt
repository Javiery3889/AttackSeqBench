**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Malicious emails with a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 are sent to officials at Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan.
2. Initial Access: The RTF document drops an embedded, encoded portable executable (PE) named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.
3. Command and Control: The MSIL/Crimson malware utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating with its command and control (C&C) servers.
4. Command and Control: Some modules of the MSIL/Crimmon malware lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs following the initial access achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access, which involves the execution of the downloader file. The CTI outline mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module often utilized for functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. It also mentions that infections typically occur in stages, with the first stage being a downloader component.

Based on this information, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from a C&C server before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The initial access is achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file.
2. The downloader file is executed on the victim's machine.
3. The MSIL/Crimson malware is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module.
4. The RAT component is likely downloaded from a C&C server, which is 213.136.87[.]122:10001 in this case.
5. The MSIL/Crimson malware utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating with its C&C servers.

Therefore, it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001 before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

**Final Answer: A**
