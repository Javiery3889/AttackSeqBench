**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to OneDrive hosting malicious files.
2. Defense Evasion: The GHOLE malware campaign employed various evasion techniques, including:
   - Using a .DLL file with an export function named 'function' instead of 'gholee'.
   - Using hard-coded IP addresses for C&C communication.
   - Creating a mutex called 'woolger' and a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence.
   - Creating a startup folder entry with a Notepad icon.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after employing a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence and creating a mutex called 'woolger' to establish defense evasion mechanisms. The question specifically asks if the GHOLE malware will communicate with its C&C servers and the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' and a mutex called 'woolger', which are mentioned in the CTI outline as part of the defense evasion mechanisms employed by the GHOLE malware. The question also asks about the communication with C&C servers and the upload of keystroke logs, which is related to the CWoolger keylogger.

Based on the CTI outline, the CWoolger keylogger is mentioned as a malware that is silently installed by the 'Iran's Missiles Program.ppt.exe' executable. The keylogger creates a mutex called 'woolger' and a VBScript named 'wsc.vbs' for persistence. However, there is no direct information in the CTI outline about the CWoolger keylogger uploading keystroke logs to C&C servers.

However, the CTI outline does mention that the CWoolger keylogger is a malware developed by Wool3n.H4t, a malware developer responsible for the CWoolger keylogger. This suggests that the CWoolger keylogger is a separate entity from the GHOLE malware, and its behavior is not explicitly linked to the GHOLE malware's communication with C&C servers.

Given this information, it is not clear if the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers based on the provided CTI outline.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the question does not provide enough information to determine if the CWoolger keylogger will upload keystroke logs exceeding 3,000 bytes to C&C servers. The CTI outline does not explicitly link the CWoolger keylogger's behavior to the GHOLE malware's communication with C&C servers. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the correct answer with certainty.

However, since the question asks for a binary choice (Yes or No), and given that the CWoolger keylogger is a separate entity from the GHOLE malware, it is more likely that the CWoolger keylogger's behavior is not directly linked to the GHOLE malware's communication with C&C servers.

**Final Answer: B**
