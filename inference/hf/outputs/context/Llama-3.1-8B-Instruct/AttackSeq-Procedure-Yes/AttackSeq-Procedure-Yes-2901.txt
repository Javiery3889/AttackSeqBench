**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT15 in a cyber attack. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Execution**: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
2. **Persistence**: The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
4. **Defense Evasion**: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
5. **Credential Access**: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
6. **Collection**: APT15 used various tools to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory, databases, and other systems.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS after obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate using Mimikatz.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the sequence of TTPs: obtaining domain administrator credentials and a VPN certificate using Mimikatz, and then deploying backdoors. The CTI outline confirms that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials (Privilege Escalation) and stole a VPN certificate (Credential Access). The outline also mentions that APT15 deployed backdoors, including RoyalCLI, which evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution (Defense Evasion).

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate, which is followed by the deployment of backdoors, including RoyalCLI. The question specifically asks about the deployment of backdoors after obtaining credentials and a VPN certificate. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
