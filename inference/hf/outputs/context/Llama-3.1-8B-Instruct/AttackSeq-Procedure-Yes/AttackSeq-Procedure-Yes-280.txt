**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Bandook campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the following order:

1. Initial Access:
   - Delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document via a ZIP file.
   - The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
   - The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services like TinyURL or Bitly.
   - The VBA code within the external template decrypts the embedded data from the original document and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

2. Execution:
   - The 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script decodes and executes another base64 encoded PowerShell script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'.
   - The script downloads a zip file containing four files from a cloud service like Dropbox, Bitbucket, or an S3 bucket.
   - The files 'a.png', 'b.png', and 'untitled.png' are used to generate the malware payload.
   - The final executable payload is assembled from decrypted 'a.png' and 'b.png' as is.
   - The PowerShell script then executes the malware, opens 'draft.docx' (a benign document to mislead the victim), and cleans up the artifacts.

3. Defense Evasion:
   - The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time.
   - The malware payload is generated using image files to conceal its components.
   - The final Bandook payload is signed with valid certificates from Certum to appear trustworthy.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by the Bandook campaign after employing image files to conceal malicious components during the Defense Evasion phase. The question specifically asks if the campaign is likely to use the Process Hollowing technique within Internet Explorer to inject a malicious payload before employing AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not mention the Process Hollowing technique or Internet Explorer being used by the Bandook campaign. However, it does describe the use of image files to conceal malicious components during the Defense Evasion phase. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after this step.

Given the information provided, there is no indication that the Bandook campaign uses the Process Hollowing technique or Internet Explorer. The campaign's Defense Evasion techniques are focused on switching the malicious external template, concealing the malware payload in image files, and signing the final payload with valid certificates.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
