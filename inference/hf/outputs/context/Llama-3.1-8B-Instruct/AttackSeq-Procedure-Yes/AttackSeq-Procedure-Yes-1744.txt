**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks)
3. Execution (executing a sophisticated memory-resident malware)
4. Persistence (utilizing web shells and a custom malware framework)
5. Privilege Escalation (employing various techniques, including custom Potato family tools)
6. Credential Access (modifying login webpages to record credentials)
7. Discovery (using publicly available offensive security tools to perform reconnaissance)
8. Lateral Movement (accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials)
9. Command and Control (establishing command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after employing a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation, TG1021 demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline states that the threat actor "actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them, effectively giving up on persistency in exchange for stealth." This indicates that the threat actor did indeed demonstrate efforts to avoid detection by removing disk-resident tools.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the threat actor's actions align with the description of defense evasion through removal of disk-resident tools. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
