**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Konni APT Group, which involves the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The attack starts with delivering an ISO file from an in-the-wild (ITW) URL.
2. Execution: The attack involves the execution of various VBScripts and batch files, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
3. Persistence: The 'stopedge.bat' file contributes to persistence by scheduling 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present in the directory.
4. Discovery: The 'versioninfo.bat' script discovers information about the user's computer, including directory listings, IP addresses, running processes, and system details.
5. Collection: The 'versioninfo.bat' script collects a variety of information from the user's computer and prepares it for exfiltration.
6. Command and Control: The 'activate.vbs' script communicates with a C2 server by sending an HTTP request and saving the content retrieved. The 'resolvedns.bat' also facilitates communication with the C2 server to initiate the download of a file.
7. Exfiltration: The 'unactivate.vbs' script exfiltrates data through a POST request, and the 'versioninfo.bat' script exfiltrates collected information about the user's computer using 'unactivate.vbs'.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the likelihood of the Konni APT Group using heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, after 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes for persistence, and prior to 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details such as directory listings and running processes.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence involves the execution of various VBScripts and batch files, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'. The 'install.vbs' script is scheduled to run every 33 minutes for persistence after 'stopedge.bat' is executed.

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, in the attack sequence. However, it does mention that the 'install.vbs' script, once deobfuscated, executes a batch script named 'resolve.dns'. This suggests that some level of obfuscation may be involved in the attack.

However, the question specifically asks about the use of heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, prior to 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details. The CTI outline does not provide information about the level of obfuscation used in the scripts prior to 'versioninfo.bat' being executed.

Given the lack of information about the use of heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, prior to 'versioninfo.bat' discovering system details, the most plausible answer is that the Konni APT Group is not likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, in this specific part of the attack sequence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:
