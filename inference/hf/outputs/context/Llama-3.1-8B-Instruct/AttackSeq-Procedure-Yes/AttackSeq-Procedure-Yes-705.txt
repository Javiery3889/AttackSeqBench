**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence carried out by TA505, a known cybercrime threat actor. The sequence includes:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to gain access to victims' IT infrastructure.
2. Execution: Utilizing Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon on systems running the vulnerable Serv-U software.
3. Persistence: Attempting to maintain access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and altering the COM handler associated with it to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion after gaining initial access and executing Cobalt Strike Beacon.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon and also encoded the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64. This suggests that TA505 has a history of using Base64 encoding for encoding malware and commands.

Given this information, it is likely that TA505 will continue to use Base64 encoding for defense evasion, including storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. TA505 has a history of using Base64 encoding for encoding malware and commands.
2. The CTI outline mentions that TA505 encoded the FlawedGrace RAT loader in Base64.
3. It is likely that TA505 will continue to use Base64 encoding for defense evasion.
4. Therefore, it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A**
