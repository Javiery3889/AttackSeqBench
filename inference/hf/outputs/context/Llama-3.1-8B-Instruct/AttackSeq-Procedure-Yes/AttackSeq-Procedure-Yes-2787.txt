**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence related to Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on an iOS malware. The sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned is:

1. Initial Access: The malware is installed on already compromised systems.
2. Execution: The XAgent app is installed and runs in the background, hiding its icon on iOS 7 devices but not on iOS 8 devices.
3. Discovery: The app collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) after the app collects information and performs routines on the iOS device. The question specifically asks if the gathered information is sent via HTTP before uploading files via FTP protocol as part of Command and Control operations.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the sequence of TTPs described is:

1. Initial Access (malware installation)
2. Execution (app runs in the background)
3. Discovery (information collection)

The question asks about the next step after the app collects information. Since the CTI outline does not explicitly mention sending the gathered information via HTTP or FTP, we need to infer the next step based on typical Command and Control (C2) operations.

Typically, after collecting information, a malware would send the data back to the C2 server for further analysis or exfiltration. HTTP is a common protocol used for sending data over the internet, and FTP is often used for uploading files. Given the context, it is plausible that the app would send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Initial Access (malware installation)
2. Execution (app runs in the background)
3. Discovery (information collection)
4. Command and Control (sending gathered information via HTTP, followed by uploading files via FTP)

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Final Answer: A
