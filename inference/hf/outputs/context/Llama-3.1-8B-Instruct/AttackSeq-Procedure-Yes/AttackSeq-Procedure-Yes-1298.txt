**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing Attachment (T1193)
2. Execution: User Execution (T1204) using a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882
3. Credential Access: Credential Dumping (T1003), Credentials in Files (T1081), and Credentials in Registry (T1214)
4. Collection: Data from Local System (T1005)
5. Command and Control: Commonly Used Port (T1043) and Standard Application Layer Protocol (T1071)
6. Exfiltration: Data Encrypted (T1002)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions two specific TTPs: exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and stealing stored passwords and access tokens. The attack sequence in the CTI outline shows that these two TTPs occur in the following order:

1. Exploiting CVE-2017-11882 (T1204)
2. Stealing stored passwords and access tokens (Credential Dumping, T1003, and Credentials in Registry, T1214)

The question asks if the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) before the credential access phase. However, the CTI outline does not mention File Deletion (T1107) as part of the attack sequence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence in the CTI outline, the campaign exploits CVE-2017-11882 and then steals stored passwords and access tokens. There is no indication that the campaign employs File Deletion (T1107) as part of defense evasion before the credential access phase.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
