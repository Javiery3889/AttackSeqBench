**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The attack starts with reconnaissance, where SCILabs identified a new Cosmic Banker attack targeting user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
2. Initial Access: The attack delivers the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT).
3. Execution: The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file includes a batch programming script that executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
4. Execution (continued): The PowerShell script downloads the file md.zip, which includes the main malware library DLL, the executable loader part of the Autolt toolkit, and other services.
5. Persistence: The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.
6. Defense Evasion: The main malicious file 12.dll is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
7. Credential Access: The malware aims to steal bank credentials from Mexican financial institution users.
8. Collection: The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to try to access contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
9. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicates with the domains h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net.
10. Exfiltration: The collected email accounts are exfiltrated to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The attack sequence described in the CTI outline shows that the PowerShell script is executed from the Internet to run at memory level (Step 3) before the malware aims to ensure persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks (Step 5).

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence, the correct order of events is:

1. Initial Access (delivery of COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via phishing email)
2. Execution (PowerShell script executed from the Internet to run at memory level)
3. Execution (continued) (downloading of md.zip and other files)
4. Persistence (ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks)

Therefore, it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks.

**Final Answer: A**
