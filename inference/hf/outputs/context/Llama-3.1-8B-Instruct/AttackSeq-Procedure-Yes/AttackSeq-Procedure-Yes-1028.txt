**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Gamaredon group. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
2. Execution: Malicious DLLs, scripting (Batch files and VBScript), and user execution of email attachments
3. Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents
4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry key modifications, code signing, and deobfuscation
5. Discovery: Backdoors listing interesting files for future exfiltration
6. Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into documents and sending emails with malicious attachments
7. Command and Control: Using HTTP and HTTPS for C2
8. Exfiltration: Uploading harvested documents to the C2 server

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after using Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, the Gamaredon group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration (Discovery). This suggests that the group does have a mechanism to scan for sensitive documents. Additionally, the group's persistence techniques include registering modules as scheduled tasks, which could be used to run scripts for scanning.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, it is likely that the Gamaredon group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities. The group's backdoors are designed to list interesting files, and their persistence techniques include scheduled tasks, which could be used to run scripts for scanning.

Final Answer: A
