**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Taidoor malware campaign, which involves the following sequence of MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Reconnaissance: Spear-phishing email sent to targets.
2. Initial Access: Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments to drop the Taidoor malware.
3. Execution: The Taidoor malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
4. Command and Control: The Taidoor malware communicates with two CnC servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) via email attachments, which is a part of the Initial Access tactic. The question then asks about the evolution of Taidoor to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

Based on the CTI outline, we know that the Taidoor malware has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012, which suggests that it has evolved over time. Additionally, the malware has been active since 2008 and continues to be used in cyber espionage campaigns, indicating that it is a dynamic and adaptable threat.

Given this information, it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the reasoning is as follows:

1. The Taidoor malware has a history of evolving and adapting to evade detection.
2. The malware has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012.
3. The malware continues to be used in cyber espionage campaigns, indicating its dynamic nature.
4. It is likely that Taidoor will continue to evolve to avoid common network detection signatures.

**Final Answer: A**
