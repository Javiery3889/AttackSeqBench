**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros are sent to victims.
2. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro executes, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
3. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script operates in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk, and uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically mentions the execution of VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document, which is a key part of the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. The CTI outline states that upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro executes, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.

Given this information, it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
