**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the OceanLotus backdoor's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: The backdoor is distributed via a zip file, which is delivered through an email attachment.
2. Execution: The backdoor executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.
3. Execution: The backdoor opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path.
4. Persistence: The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up and copies itself to a location based on the user's UID.
5. Defense Evasion: The backdoor employs a robust string encoding mechanism and a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
6. Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the OceanLotus backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server after achieving persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor communicates with the command and control server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, which involves initiating a session, receiving an ephemeral encryption key and command from the server, executing the command, and sending back the results encrypted with AES in CBC mode. This suggests that the backdoor does send information to the command and control server after establishing persistence.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the backdoor's Command and Control phase involves sending information to the command and control server after establishing a session. Since the backdoor achieves persistence by creating a Launch Agent and copying itself to a location based on the user's UID, it is likely that the backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its command and control server.
