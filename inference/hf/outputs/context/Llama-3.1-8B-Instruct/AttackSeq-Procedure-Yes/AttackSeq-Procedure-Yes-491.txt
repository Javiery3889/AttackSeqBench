**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack targeting iOS users in Hong Kong, which involves a watering hole attack, exploitation of iOS vulnerabilities, and the installation of a new iOS malware variant named lightSpy (IOS_LightSpy.A). The malware has a modular design, allowing for data exfiltration, remote command execution, and file manipulation on the infected device. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: Watering hole attack targeting iOS users in Hong Kong.
2. Execution: Exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to download and execute the lightSpy malware.
3. Defense Evasion: Employing a sophisticated spyware with a modular design, using a customized kernel exploit to gain root privileges, and maintaining control over the device.
4. Collection: Collecting and exfiltrating a wide range of data from the infected device, including hardware information, contacts, text messages, call history, saved WiFi information, browser history, and user location.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the lightSpy malware is likely to leverage hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration via its main control module, light, after performing data collection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the lightSpy malware has a modular design, which allows for module updates and remote command execution. The malware's modules are designed for data exfiltration, and the infection chain involves a customized kernel exploit to gain root privileges. The payload.dylib file is signed with a legitimate Apple developer certificate, indicating the campaign's activity started around November 29, 2019.

Considering the modular design of the lightSpy malware and its capabilities for module updates and remote command execution, it is likely that the malware would leverage hardcoded C&C server locations for module updates and data exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
