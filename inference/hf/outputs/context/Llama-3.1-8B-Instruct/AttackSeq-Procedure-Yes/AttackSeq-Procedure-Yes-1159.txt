**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the PROMETHIUM threat actor. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The threat actor uses trojanized installation files to gain initial access to victims' systems.
2. Execution: The malware is deployed alongside legitimate applications, and a service is created for persistence.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence by creating a service that launches the C2 contact module upon service startup.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware checks for ESET or BitDefender antivirus and adds its directories to the Windows Defender exclusions list.
5. Collection: The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files.
6. Command and Control: The C2 infrastructure communicates over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs during the Collection phase, specifically after the malware searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives. The question is focused on the Exfiltration phase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not provide explicit information about the Exfiltration phase, but it does mention that the malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files during the Collection phase. However, it does not provide details about encoding or splitting the archives.

Given the lack of information about the Exfiltration phase, we can infer that the question is asking for a hypothetical scenario based on the Collection phase. The CTI outline does not provide any information that would suggest the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, we can conclude that:

1. The PROMETHIUM malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files during the Collection phase.
2. The CTI outline does not provide any information about encoding or splitting the archives during the Exfiltration phase.
3. Since the CTI outline does not provide any information that would suggest the malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks, we cannot confirm this behavior.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
