**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the AtomBombing technique, which involves injecting malicious code into trusted processes to bypass process-level restrictions. This allows threat actors to evade security products, access context-specific data, and perform Man in the Browser (MitB) attacks. The key points from the outline are:

- AtomBombing bypasses process-level restrictions
- It evades security products
- It does not require OS bugs or vulnerabilities
- It cannot be fixed with a patch
- Security products must monitor API calls to mitigate this technique

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if threat actors will bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions after using AtomBombing to inject malicious code into legitimate programs.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, AtomBombing is specifically mentioned to evade security products. The question asks about the likelihood of bypassing AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions. Given that AtomBombing is designed to evade security products, it is reasonable to conclude that it would also bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline states that AtomBombing evades security products.
2. The question asks about the likelihood of bypassing AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
3. Since AtomBombing is designed to evade security products, it is logical to conclude that it would also bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
4. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.

Final Answer: A
