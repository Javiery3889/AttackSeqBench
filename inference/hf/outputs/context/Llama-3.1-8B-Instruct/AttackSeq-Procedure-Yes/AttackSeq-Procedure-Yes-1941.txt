**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Smooth Operator malware's behavior, including its initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and command and control (C2) tactics. The key details are:

- Initial Access: Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
- Execution: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software and creates a new thread to run its functionality.
- Persistence: Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
- Defense Evasion: The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process, deletes itself from disk, and writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
- Discovery: Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including OS version, domain, and account name values.
- Collection: The malware stages collect data from the victim machine, including OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index.
- Command and Control: Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the Smooth Operator malware will automatically exfiltrate collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request after establishing communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the second-stage payload uses a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. However, it does mention that the second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, parses and extracts domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json for exfiltration. This implies that the second-stage payload is responsible for collecting and exfiltrating data, but it does not specify the method of exfiltration.

Given the information provided, it is likely that the second-stage payload will exfiltrate collected data, but the CTI outline does not provide explicit details on the method of exfiltration. However, since the question asks about a HTTP GET request specifically, we need to consider the context of the malware's behavior.

The malware uses HTTPS for C2 communication, which suggests a secure and encrypted channel. However, the question is asking about a HTTP GET request, which is typically used for unencrypted communication. Given the malware's use of HTTPS for C2 communication, it is unlikely that it would use an unencrypted HTTP GET request for exfiltration.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not explicitly state the use of a HTTP GET request for exfiltration. However, considering the malware's use of HTTPS for C2 communication, it is unlikely that it would use an unencrypted HTTP GET request for exfiltration.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: B
