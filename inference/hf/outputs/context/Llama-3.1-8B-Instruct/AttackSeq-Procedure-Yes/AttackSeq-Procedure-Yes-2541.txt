**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Chinese APT group Deep Panda. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Resource Development**: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
2. **Initial Access**: Exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability allowed them to gain initial access.
3. **Execution**: They spawned new PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts.
4. **Installation**: The chain of scripts culminated in the installation of a malicious DLL.
5. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensured persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
6. **Privilege Escalation**: The 2016 version of the Milestone backdoor created a new administrator user and executed another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser.
7. **Defense Evasion**: Deep Panda used a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to evade detection.
8. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor had capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
9. **Command and Control**: The Milestone backdoor communicated with a C2 server uncompressed.
10. **Exfiltration**: The Milestone backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if, after gaining initial access by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability and spawning PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts, Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of events after gaining initial access. The CTI outline indicates that after gaining initial access, Deep Panda spawned new PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts, which culminated in the installation of a malicious DLL. This suggests that executing PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files is a likely step in the attack sequence.

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file, but it does describe the execution of a chain of scripts, which is a similar concept. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that executing PowerShell scripts and a batch file is a plausible step in the attack sequence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence.
