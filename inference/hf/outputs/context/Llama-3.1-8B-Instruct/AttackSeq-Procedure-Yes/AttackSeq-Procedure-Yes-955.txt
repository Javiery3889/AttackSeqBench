**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities.
2. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing an elevation of privilege exploit against the latest builds of Windows 10, exploiting two distinct vulnerabilities in the Windows OS kernel (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956).

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after achieving privilege escalation. The CTI outline does not provide information about a Stager module notifying of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module. However, it does mention that the attackers used a "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process after exploiting the vulnerabilities.

Given the context, it is likely that the attackers would not need to notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module, as they have already achieved privilege escalation and can inject malware directly into the system process.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The attackers exploited a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access.
2. They achieved privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
3. After achieving privilege escalation, the attackers used a "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process.
4. There is no indication in the CTI outline that a Stager module would be used to notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module.

**Final Answer: B**
