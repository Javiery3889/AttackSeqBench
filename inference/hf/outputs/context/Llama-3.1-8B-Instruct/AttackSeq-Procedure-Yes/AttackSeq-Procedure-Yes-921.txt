**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Volatile Cedar attack sequence using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Vulnerability scan of the target server
2. Execution: Exploiting the vulnerability to inject a web shell code into the server
3. Persistence: Installing the Explosive Trojan on the server
4. Defense Evasion: Hiding from common detection tools and merging into the surroundings
5. Credential Access: Gaining access to administrator passwords through keylogging
6. Lateral Movement: Spreading to the entire network using the initially infected servers as a pivot
7. Command and Control: Using a multi-tiered server backend framework to control the targeted systems

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access. The question specifically asks if the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the lateral movement phase of the attack, which is described in the CTI outline as using the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread to the entire network. The question also mentions employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices, which is also described in the CTI outline.

The CTI outline explicitly states that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network, which matches the question's description. Additionally, the CTI outline mentions that more recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection, which aligns with the question's mention of infecting connected USB devices.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Scanning for and exploiting vulnerabilities on publicly facing web servers to gain initial access
2. Using the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network
3. Employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices

This sequence matches the CTI outline's description of the attack, and the question's description of the sequence of TTPs.

**Final Answer: A**
