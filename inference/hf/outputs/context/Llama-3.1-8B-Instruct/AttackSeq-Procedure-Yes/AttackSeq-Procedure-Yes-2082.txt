**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of RIG EK as follows:

1. Initial Access: RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
2. Execution: Upon successful execution on the victim machine, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
3. Defense Evasion: RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.
4. Command and Control: RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly asks about the Initial Access technique used by RIG EK. According to the CTI outline, RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits, or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript. This matches the Initial Access technique described in the question.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, RIG EK uses malvertising to deliver exploits to victims. The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page. This is a direct match with the Initial Access technique described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A
