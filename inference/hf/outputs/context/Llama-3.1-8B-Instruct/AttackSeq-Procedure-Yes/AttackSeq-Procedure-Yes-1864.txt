**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack involving a rootkit named Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a that targets HP iLO firmware. The attack sequence involves:

1. Persistence: The rootkit manipulates the iLO firmware upgrade routine to maintain persistence by simulating version changes and preventing actual updates.
2. Defense Evasion: The rootkit evades detection by simulating firmware updates, displaying fake version information, modifying the firmware update process, and altering admin web interface modules to display invalid software version information. It also modifies server event logging modules to prevent logging of its operations.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a is likely capable of wiping server disks as part of hiding tracks and potentially disrupting operations after evading detection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the rootkit's capability to wipe server disks. However, it does describe the rootkit's ability to manipulate the firmware update process and prevent event logging of its operations. This suggests that the rootkit is designed to maintain its presence and evade detection, but it does not provide information about its ability to wipe server disks.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the information provided in the CTI outline, the rootkit's primary goal is to maintain persistence and evade detection, not to wipe server disks. While the rootkit's capabilities are extensive, there is no direct evidence to suggest that it can wipe server disks. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
