**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
2. Initial Access: Financial organizations in Turkey are targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
3. Execution: The malicious Word document downloads and executes the Bankshot implant from falcancoin.io.
4. Persistence: The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.
5. Defense Evasion: The Bankshot implant contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions.
6. Command and Control: The implants (DLLs) communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Hidden Cobra will develop the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the tactic of Resource Development, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, the CTI outline describes the Bankshot implant's capabilities, including Defense Evasion and Command and Control. The question asks about the development of the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system.

Based on the CTI outline, the Bankshot implant already has the capability to wipe files and content from the targeted system (Defense Evasion) and communicates with control servers (Command and Control). Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will continue to develop the Bankshot implants with these capabilities.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the development of the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system.
2. The CTI outline describes the Bankshot implant's capabilities, including Defense Evasion and Command and Control.
3. The Bankshot implant already has the capability to wipe files and content from the targeted system (Defense Evasion) and communicates with control servers (Command and Control).
4. Therefore, it is likely that Hidden Cobra will continue to develop the Bankshot implants with these capabilities.

**Final Answer: A**
