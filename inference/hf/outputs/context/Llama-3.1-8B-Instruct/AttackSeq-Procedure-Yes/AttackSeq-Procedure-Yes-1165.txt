**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Longhorn group, a threat actor. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Initial Access: Utilizing back door Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets.
2. Initial Access: Using a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
3. Discovery: Performing system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
4. Command and Control: Configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity.
5. Exfiltration: Communicating externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of a zero-day exploit to infect a target with Plexor malware, which is part of the Initial Access tactic. The question then asks about the likelihood of Longhorn's tools following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

Based on the CTI outline, it is mentioned that Longhorn's malware uses operational security measures to remain undetected, and they configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their real identity. This suggests that Longhorn does follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the information in the CTI outline, it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware.

Final Answer: A
