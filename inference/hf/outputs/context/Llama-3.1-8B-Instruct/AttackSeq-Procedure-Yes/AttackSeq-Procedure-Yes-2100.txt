**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents were used to gain initial access.
2. Execution: The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines.
3. Persistence: The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
4. Defense Evasion: The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain.
5. Discovery: The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer.
6. Collection: The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system.
7. Exfiltration: The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the backdoor installed by the attackers will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Defense Evasion
5. Discovery
6. Collection
7. Exfiltration

The question specifically asks about the exfiltration step, which is step 7 in the attack sequence. The CTI outline mentions that the backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, but it does not explicitly state whether the communication with the C&C server is encrypted.

However, the CTI outline does mention that the loader used anti-sandboxing techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server. This suggests that the attackers employed encryption techniques throughout the infection chain, including during the exfiltration step.

Therefore, it is likely that the backdoor installed by the attackers will communicate with a C&C server using an encrypted channel before exfiltrating data such as screenshots and system information through the established C&C channel.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the final answer is:
