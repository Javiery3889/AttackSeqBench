**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the RevengeHotels campaign, which targets the hospitality sector with spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments. The attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199 and use template injection to execute macro code, which downloads and executes malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, and ProCC. The malware is protected with Yoda Obfuscator and unpacks to reveal commercial RATs like RevengeRAT. An additional module called ScreenBooking captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if attackers will collect credit card information from OTA (Online Travel Agency) websites during their operations after gaining initial access and executing RAT malware like RevengeRAT.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies. It also mentions that the ScreenBooking module captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com, which is an OTA website. This suggests that the attackers are interested in collecting credit card information from OTA websites.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the attackers' goal is to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies, including OTA websites. The ScreenBooking module is specifically designed to capture credit card data by monitoring web pages, including booking.com. Therefore, it is likely that the attackers will collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations.
