**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the threat actor, Earth Lusca, during a cyber attack. The attack sequence can be broken down into the following order:

1. Reconnaissance: Gathering information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations using various tools and Windows utilities.
2. Initial Access: Utilizing spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing servers to infect targets.
3. Execution: Deploying malicious code using command and scripting interpreters, deploying containers, and scheduling tasks/jobs to run malicious code.
4. Persistence: Maintaining access to systems through various persistence techniques such as account manipulation, BITS jobs, creating accounts, modifying system processes, and leveraging external remote services.
5. Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher-level permissions using techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms, creating or modifying system processes, and hijacking execution flow.
6. Defense Evasion: Avoiding detection using various techniques such as abuse of elevation control mechanisms, BITS jobs, deobfuscating/decoding files or information, deploying containers, hiding artifacts, hijacking execution flow, impairing defenses, modifying the registry, and using signed binary proxy execution.
7. Credential Access: Targeting user credentials to gain greater access to internal networks.
8. Discovery: Using scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network environment.
9. Collection: Collecting data from local systems and network shared drives, and capturing email and screen data.
10. Command and Control: Establishing C&C servers and using various techniques to mimic normal traffic and avoid detection.
11. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating data by compressing files into archives and using the megacmd tool to upload them to cloud accounts.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers after employing scanning tools and commands during the discovery phase.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the discovery phase involves using scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands like 'hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443' to scan for NetBIOS name information and shared folders. This is followed by the credential access phase, where the threat actor targets user credentials to gain greater access to internal networks.

Given this sequence, it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers to gain further access to the network and exfiltrate data.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The discovery phase involves scanning the network to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities.
2. The threat actor will likely use the information gathered during the discovery phase to identify remote services that can be exploited.
3. Exploiting remote services will allow the threat actor to gain access to the network and establish a foothold for lateral movement.
4. Establishing network tunnels between the target's network and external servers will enable the threat actor to maintain access and exfiltrate data.

**Final Answer: A**
