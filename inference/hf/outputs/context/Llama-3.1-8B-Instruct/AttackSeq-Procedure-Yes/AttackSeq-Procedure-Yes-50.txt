**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with embedded macros in Microsoft Word documents. The campaign's goal is to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to the target systems.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through the phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Execution**: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
4. **Defense Evasion**: The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether, after evading defenses by operating in memory and using the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk, the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk. It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and leveraged the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk. This suggests that the PowerShell script is designed to download and execute payloads in memory, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.

Given this information, it is likely that the PowerShell script will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
