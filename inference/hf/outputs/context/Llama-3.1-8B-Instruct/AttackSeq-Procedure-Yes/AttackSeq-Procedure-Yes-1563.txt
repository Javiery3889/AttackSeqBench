**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sophisticated supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, an IT managed services provider, which led to the deployment of a custom backdoor, Sunburst, on the networks of over 18,000 customers. This initial access allowed for further exploitation.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence in the Order Presented by the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**

1. Initial Access: Compromise of SolarWinds through a supply-chain attack.
2. Initial Access: Exploitation of four zero-days in Exchange Server by HAFNIUM and Volexity.
3. Initial Access: A campaign targeting governmental entities in the Russian Federation using Exchange zero-days and a previously unknown malware family named FourteenHi.

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation after compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Sunburst backdoor's behavior after initial access. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the communication protocol used by the Sunburst backdoor. However, it is common for backdoors to communicate with their C2 servers using various protocols for further exploitation.

**Step 5: Reasoning and Final Answer**

Given the context of the attack and the typical behavior of backdoors, it is likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation. This is a common practice in cyber attacks to maintain control and gather information.

**Final Answer: A**
