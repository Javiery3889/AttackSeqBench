**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor FIN13. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK).
2. Execution: FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
3. Discovery: FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services to support their objectives.
4. Lateral Movement: FIN13 uses WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally.
5. Collection: FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
6. Command and Control: FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
7. Exfiltration: FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the sequence of TTPs: Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware), followed by Execution (employing JSPRAT). The CTI outline shows that after Initial Access, FIN13 employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during the Execution phase. However, the question asks about the Reconnaissance phase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline as a separate phase. The Discovery phase is mentioned, which involves gathering information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.

Given the context, it is likely that the Reconnaissance phase is implied within the Discovery phase. Therefore, it is plausible that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Discovery phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
