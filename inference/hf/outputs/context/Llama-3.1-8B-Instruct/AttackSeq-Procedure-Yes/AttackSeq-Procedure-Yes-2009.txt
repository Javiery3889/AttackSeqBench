**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, social media data collection and analysis for future targeting.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, and employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros to install BlackEnergy 3 malware.
3. Execution: The malware is installed on the employee workstations, and the VBA script places multiple malicious files on the workstation, unbeknown to the employee.
4. Execution: The files placed on the workstations begin the communication process with external Command and Control (CC) servers.
5. Credential Access: The delivered BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
6. Discovery: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand accessed.
7. Discovery: Adversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the malware will establish a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence, the malware is installed on the employee workstations in Step 3 (Execution), and the files placed on the workstations begin the communication process with external Command and Control (CC) servers in the same step. This indicates that the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, which includes the installation of BlackEnergy 3 malware on employee workstations.
2. The malware is installed in Step 3 (Execution), and the files placed on the workstations begin the communication process with external Command and Control (CC) servers in the same step.
3. This indicates that the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is that the malware will establish a connection from the malicious implant to an attacker-controlled command and control (C2) server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

**Final Answer: A**
