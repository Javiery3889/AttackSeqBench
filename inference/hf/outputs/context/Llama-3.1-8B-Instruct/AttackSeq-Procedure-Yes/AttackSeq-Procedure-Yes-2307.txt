**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying attack against remote services.
2. Execution: Installing Cobalt Strike beacon in memory using PowerShell one-liner.
3. Persistence: Loading Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms.
4. Privilege Escalation: Password spraying attack against domain admin accounts or lateral movement to a system with a domain admin logged in.
5. Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces from intrusions (Windows event logs clearing, File deletion, Timestomping).
6. Credential Access: Achieving credentials access by brute force, credential stuffing, or password spraying.
7. Discovery: Applying a wide range of discovery tactics, including using PsLogList to export Security Event log contents.
8. Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM).
9. Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike as a framework to manage compromised systems.
10. Exfiltration: Exfiltrating small amounts of data using the command and control channel, and large amounts of data using a custom-built tool.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the adversary will copy results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives, before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The attack sequence described in the CTI outline shows that the adversary uses Cobalt Strike to identify target systems and data of interest through lateral movement. After identifying the data of interest, the adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data, including mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property. This suggests that the adversary would likely copy the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives, before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the adversary's behavior is consistent with the following reasoning:

1. The adversary uses Cobalt Strike to identify target systems and data of interest through lateral movement.
2. The adversary uses a custom-built tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data, including mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property.
3. The custom-built tool is used to exfiltrate specified files to cloud storage web services.
4. The adversary would likely copy the results of the discovery phase, such as file and directory lists from network shared drives, before exfiltrating this data using cloud storage web services.

Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the adversary will copy the results of the discovery phase before exfiltrating the data.

**Final Answer: A**
