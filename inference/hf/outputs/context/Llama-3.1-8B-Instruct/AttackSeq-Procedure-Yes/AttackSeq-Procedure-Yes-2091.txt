**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the Carbanak group using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: The group conducted reconnaissance by collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
2. Initial Access: The group used spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents to download a Cobalt Strike beacon component.
3. Execution: The group had the ability to download and execute new payloads, run shell commands to move laterally in the infrastructure, and delete files from the system.
4. Persistence: The group established persistence in the infrastructure using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
5. Privilege Escalation: The group aimed to find admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure.
6. Defense Evasion: The group minimized detection opportunities by performing operations outside business hours, limiting interaction to a handful of systems, and using single workstations as a hub for centralizing collected information and communication with their C&C server.
7. Credential Access: The group compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise at least two more endpoints.
8. Discovery: The group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints.
9. Collection: The group collected and prepared a series of potentially valuable documents pertaining to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.
10. Command and Control: The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control, allowing the attackers to communicate with compromised systems and check for new commands to be executed.
11. Exfiltration: The group prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers after discovering and mapping the organization's internal network using the Cobalt Strike beacon and collecting administrative-level credentials.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is related to the Discovery and Credential Access phases of the attack sequence. The Discovery phase involves using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints. The Credential Access phase involves using the compromised credentials to compromise at least two more endpoints.

Based on the attack sequence, it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure after discovering and mapping the organization's internal network and collecting administrative-level credentials.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, which indicates that they have gained access to the network and are now aware of its layout.
2. The attackers collected administrative-level credentials, which will allow them to move laterally across the infrastructure.
3. The attackers have already compromised at least two more endpoints using the compromised credentials, indicating that they are actively moving laterally.
4. The attackers' goal is to collect valuable information and exfiltrate it, which requires them to move laterally and compromise additional systems.

Based on these steps, it is likely that the attackers will move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

**Final Answer: A**
