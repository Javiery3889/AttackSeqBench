**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the A41APT campaign's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in the following order:

1. Initial Access: The attackers gained access to the target network via SSL-VPN abuse or stolen credentials.
2. Execution: The attackers executed malicious code using DESLoader, which employed DLL side-loading techniques and fileless implants.
3. Persistence: The attackers maintained their foothold by registering scheduled tasks to execute DESLoader every 15 minutes.
4. Defense Evasion: The attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including fileless implants, DLL side-loading, and removal of event logs.
5. Credential Access: The attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports and used administrator accounts to deploy RDP to servers.
6. Discovery: The attackers conducted discovery activities, including scanning for open RDP and SMB ports, using WMIC to collect information on security products, and deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.
7. Command and Control: The attackers communicated with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the A41APT campaign will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network after conducting discovery activities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports (Credential Access) and conducted discovery activities, including scanning for open RDP and SMB ports (Discovery). Given this information, it is likely that the attackers will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
