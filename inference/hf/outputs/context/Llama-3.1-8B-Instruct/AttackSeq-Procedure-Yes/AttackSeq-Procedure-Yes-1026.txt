**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Gamaredon group, a threat actor. The outline covers the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
2. Execution: Scripting, using rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments
3. Persistence: Registering modules as scheduled tasks, using Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and inserting malicious macros into existing documents
4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscation, code signing, modifying registry keys, and deobfuscation
5. Discovery: Backdoors listing interesting files, such as Office documents
6. Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macro to send email with malicious attachments
7. Command and Control: Using HTTP and HTTPS for command and control
8. Exfiltration: Uploading harvested documents to the C&C server

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection after inserting malicious macros into existing documents and using a backdoor to list interesting files.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that the Gamaredon group uses a backdoor to list interesting files, such as Office documents, during the Discovery phase. This suggests that the group is interested in collecting specific types of data, including Office documents. However, there is no explicit mention of scanning all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data.

However, considering the group's persistence and lateral movement tactics, it is likely that they would want to collect data from all available sources, including network shared drives, to maximize their data collection efforts.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The Gamaredon group uses a backdoor to list interesting files, such as Office documents, during the Discovery phase.
2. This suggests that the group is interested in collecting specific types of data, including Office documents.
3. Considering the group's persistence and lateral movement tactics, it is likely that they would want to collect data from all available sources, including network shared drives.
4. Therefore, it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection.

**Final Answer: A**
