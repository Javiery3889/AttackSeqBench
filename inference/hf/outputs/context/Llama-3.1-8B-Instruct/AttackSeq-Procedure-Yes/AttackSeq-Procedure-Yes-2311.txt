**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Credential stuffing or password spraying attack against the victim's remote services.
2. Execution: Installing Cobalt Strike beacon in memory using a PowerShell one-liner.
3. Persistence: Loading the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without persistence mechanisms.
4. Privilege Escalation: Starting a password spraying attack against domain admin accounts and using NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
5. Defense Evasion: Cleaning up traces from intrusions by clearing Windows event logs, deleting files, and using Timestomping.
6. Credential Access: Achieving credentials access by brute force, credential stuffing, or password spraying.
7. Discovery: Applying a wide range of discovery tactics, including using PsLogList to export Security Event logs and Mimikatz to dump credentials.
8. Lateral Movement: Using Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement possibilities, such as SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
9. Collection: Collecting data from various sources within the victim's network, including information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online.
10. Command and Control: Using Cobalt Strike as a framework to manage compromised systems.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the adversary will execute custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage web services after collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The attack sequence described in the CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of custom-built malware for exfiltration. However, it does mention the use of Cobalt Strike as a framework for managing compromised systems and exfiltrating data. The question specifically asks about the use of custom-built malware, which is not mentioned in the attack sequence.

Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the adversary will execute custom-built malware for exfiltration, as they have been using Cobalt Strike for this purpose. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B**
