**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor, Agrius. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting public-facing applications using publicly available exploits (CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, and SQL injection).
2. Execution: Deploying custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper', for data exfiltration and additional malware deployment.
3. Persistence: Registering the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor as a service for persistence and deploying webshells.
4. Defense Evasion: Using webshells with obfuscation and a custom base64 encoding function, and updating the backdoor to evade defenses.
5. Lateral Movement: Tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement using webshells and publicly available tools.
6. Command and Control: Communicating with C2 servers over HTTP through the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if Agrius is likely to deploy wipers like 'Apostle' (later turned into functioning ransomware) after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform actions.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the sequence of TTPs involving the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor and its communication with C2 servers. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle'. However, it does describe the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor's functionality, which includes updating its engine and deleting traces of itself to evade defenses. This suggests that Agrius is actively updating and modifying its malware to evade detection and maintain persistence.

Given the context, it is plausible that Agrius would deploy additional malware, including wipers like 'Apostle', to further compromise the targeted systems. The fact that 'Apostle' was later turned into functioning ransomware implies that Agrius has the capability to modify and adapt its malware to achieve different objectives.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs suggests that Agrius would likely deploy wipers like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers and perform actions.

Final Answer: A
