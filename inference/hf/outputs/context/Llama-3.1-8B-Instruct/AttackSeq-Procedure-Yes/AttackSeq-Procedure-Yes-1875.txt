**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence can be broken down into the following order:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Lateral Movement
9. Collection
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks after using utilities like ProcDump and executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE, which are techniques used by FIN13 for Privilege Escalation and Execution, respectively. However, the question specifically asks about exploiting external servers and deploying web shells for initial access.

According to the CTI outline, FIN13 uses various methods for initial access, including JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports, listening for incoming HTTP requests and executing commands via cmd.exe.

However, there is no mention of exploiting external servers or deploying web shells for initial access in the CTI outline. Instead, FIN13 uses these techniques for Execution, Persistence, and Defense Evasion.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, it appears that FIN13 does not exploit external servers and deploy web shells for initial access. The CTI outline suggests that FIN13 uses various techniques for initial access, but exploiting external servers and deploying web shells is not mentioned.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

Final Answer: B
