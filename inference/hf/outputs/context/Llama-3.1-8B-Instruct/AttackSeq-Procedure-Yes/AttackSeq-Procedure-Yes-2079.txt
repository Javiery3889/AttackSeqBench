**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the behavior of RIG EK, a known exploit kit. The attack sequence can be broken down into the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques:

1. **Initial Access**: Drive-by Compromise (T1185) - RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising or compromised sites.
2. **Execution**: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) - RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
3. **Defense Evasion**: Exploitation for Client Execution (T1218) - RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
4. **Command and Control**: Other (T1204) - RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether RIG EK's exploit server will return encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question directly asks about the use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encryption in command and control operations. The CTI outline mentions that RIG EK uses proxy servers for defense evasion, but it does not explicitly state the use of a custom RC4 algorithm for encryption. However, it does mention that RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm in its command and control operations.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, we can infer that RIG EK uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for encryption in its command and control operations. This is mentioned in the "Others" section of the CTI outline, which provides additional context about the threat actor.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
