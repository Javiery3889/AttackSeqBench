**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Carbanak group's attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Collecting data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
2. Initial Access: Compromising victims through spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
3. Execution: Downloading and executing new payloads, running shell commands, and deleting files to leave fewer forensic traces.
4. Persistence: Establishing persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
5. Privilege Escalation: Compromising a Domain Administrator account.
6. Defense Evasion: Minimizing detection opportunities by performing operations outside business hours and using single workstations as a hub.
7. Credential Access: Compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.
8. Discovery: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
9. Lateral Movement: Moving laterally across the infrastructure to target internal hosts and servers.
10. Command and Control: Using the Cobalt Strike beacon for command and control.
11. Exfiltration: Preparing documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure targeting internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon for discovery and mapping the organization's internal network (step 8). After this, they moved laterally across the infrastructure to target internal hosts and servers (step 9). Finally, they prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration (step 11).

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of events is:

1. Discovery (step 8): The Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network.
2. Lateral Movement (step 9): The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure to target internal hosts and servers.
3. Exfiltration (step 11): The attackers prepared documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

Therefore, it is likely that the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure targeting internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A**
