**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of Tropic Trooper, a threat actor, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 are used to execute commands.
2. Execution: The system configuration file (in.sys) is dropped, which in turn drops a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe), a normal sidebar.exe file, a malicious loader (in"C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll"), and an encrypted configuration file.
3. Execution: UserInstall.exe abuses the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
4. Execution: The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launches dllhost.exe, then injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
5. Persistence: The backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file, decrypts it, and uses SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers.
6. Defense Evasion: Tropic Trooper uses DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection, as the malicious wab32res.dll is loaded by a benign file, sidebar.exe.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase after Tropic Trooper removed its traces by using DLL hijacking.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that during the Persistence phase, the backdoor loads the encrypted configuration file, decrypts it, and uses SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers. This indicates that SSL is used for communication with the C&C server.

The question specifically asks about the Command and Control phase, which is mentioned in the Persistence phase of the CTI outline. Since the backdoor uses SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers during the Persistence phase, it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of Tropic Trooper, including the use of SSL protocol during the Persistence phase.
2. The question asks about the Command and Control phase, which is related to the Persistence phase.
3. Since the backdoor uses SSL protocol to connect to C&C servers during the Persistence phase, it is likely that TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes.

**Final Answer: A**
