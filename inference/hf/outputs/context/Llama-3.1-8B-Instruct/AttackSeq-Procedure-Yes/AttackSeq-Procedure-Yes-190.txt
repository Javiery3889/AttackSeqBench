**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Infamous Chisel malware. The attack sequence can be identified as follows:

1. Execution: Infamous Chisel is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
2. Persistence: The malware persists on the system by replacing the legitimate netd system binary.
3. Privilege Escalation: Infamous Chisel executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and checks that it is executed by init and at the path for the legitimate netd.
5. Credential Access: Infamous Chisel scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information.
6. Discovery: The netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
7. Collection: The netd component collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
8. Command and Control: Infamous Chisel provides SCP functionality, deploys a Tor hidden service, and provides a local Socks connection for db, which provides a SSH server and client.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate collected files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question focuses on the Collection and Command and Control tactics. From the CTI outline, we know that Infamous Chisel's netd component collects files from application and data directories containing communication data (Collection). We also know that the malware provides SCP functionality, deploys a Tor hidden service, and provides a local Socks connection for db, which provides a SSH server and client (Command and Control).

Given this information, we can infer that Infamous Chisel is likely to exfiltrate the collected files using the Command and Control infrastructure it has established.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is:

1. Collection: Infamous Chisel collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
2. Command and Control: The malware uses its established Command and Control infrastructure, including the Tor hidden service and SSH connections, to exfiltrate the collected files.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Final Answer: A
