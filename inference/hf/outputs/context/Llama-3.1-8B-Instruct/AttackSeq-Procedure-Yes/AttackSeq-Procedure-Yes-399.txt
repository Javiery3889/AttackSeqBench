**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb' (MD5: d0c3f4c9896d41a7c42737134ffb4c2e).
2. Execution: The victim enables Macro content in the malicious Excel file, which uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable within a function. The functions are then combined to create a single PE file, NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll (MD5: 48573a150562c57742230583456b4c02), and executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32.
3. Command and Control: The Gholee malware establishes command and control by communicating with a Kuwait-based IP address (83.170.33.60) using an expired digital certificate.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if the Gholee malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the Gholee malware uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection during the execution phase. This suggests that the malware employs obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Additionally, the malware uses an expired digital certificate to establish a command-and-control connection, which implies that it may attempt to evade detection by security software, including sandbox software.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the Gholee malware uses obfuscation techniques to evade detection, and it establishes a command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate. Therefore, it is likely that the malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control connection.

Final Answer: A
