**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics, attributed to the Chinese APT group Deep Panda. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Resource Development**: Deep Panda developed a backdoor, Milestone, based on Gh0st RAT/Netbot Attacker's leaked source code and packed with Themida.
2. **Initial Access**: Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers to gain initial access.
3. **Execution**: The attack chain involved the execution of PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone).
4. **Persistence**: The Milestone backdoor ensured persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: The 2016 version of the Milestone backdoor created a new administrator user and executed another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser.
6. **Defense Evasion**: Deep Panda used a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, to hide and protect malicious artifacts.
7. **Discovery**: The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
8. **Command and Control**: The Milestone backdoor communicates with a C2 server uncompressed.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen on the infected system using its discovery capabilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the discovery capabilities of the Milestone backdoor, which include system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture. The Milestone backdoor also communicates with a C2 server uncompressed. Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that the Milestone backdoor would use its discovery capabilities to gather information and then exfiltrate it over the C2 channel.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the Milestone backdoor's discovery capabilities and its ability to communicate with a C2 server uncompressed suggest that it is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel after discovering system information and capturing the screen.

Final Answer: A
