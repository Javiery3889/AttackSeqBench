**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by TeamTNT in a cyber attack. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: TeamTNT uses an open Weave Scope service to gain access to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execution: The main payload, a coin miner, is executed after being downloaded and saved on the host as /usr/sbin/docker-update. The attributes of the miner are changed to immutable, and it is executed to perform cryptocurrency mining.
3. Discovery: TeamTNT's script performs discovery by scanning IP ranges for open Docker API endpoints and deploys the malware to other machines.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs that TeamTNT is likely to execute after leveraging an open Weave Scope service to achieve initial access to a Kubernetes cluster. The question specifically asks about the execution of a downloaded coin miner and scanning IP ranges to identify additional open Docker API endpoints.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question matches the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. The correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Initial Access: Leveraging an open Weave Scope service.
2. Execution: Executing a downloaded coin miner by setting its attributes to immutable and performing cryptocurrency mining.
3. Discovery: Scanning IP ranges to identify additional open Docker API endpoints for malware deployment.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of TTPs is described in the question. The answer choices are either "Yes" or "No". Since the question describes the exact sequence of TTPs used by TeamTNT, the correct answer is "Yes".

Final Answer: A
