**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware)
3. Persistence (using various methods, including replacing legitimate binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware)
4. Privilege Escalation (utilizing common techniques, adapting to diverse victim networks)
5. Defense Evasion (employing tactics such as using passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and leveraging legitimate utilities)
6. Credential Access (using techniques like process memory dumping and network sniffing)
7. Discovery (leveraging native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance)
8. Lateral Movement (using WMI, utilities, and custom web shells)
9. Collection (collecting data from network shared drives and staging it locally or remotely)
10. Command and Control (using proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols)
11. Exfiltration (exfiltrating data over web services)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if FIN13 will employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access, before using other methods to establish persistence.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, we can see that FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including replacing legitimate binaries with trojanized versions and deploying malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. The question specifically asks about the use of passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before establishing persistence.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access (Initial Access).
2. The question asks if they will employ passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence.
3. According to the CTI outline, FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, but it does not explicitly state that they use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE as a precursor to establishing persistence.
4. However, it is mentioned that FIN13 uses defense evasion tactics, which includes using passive backdoors for stealth.
5. Given the context, it is plausible that FIN13 might use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE as part of their defense evasion tactics, which could potentially be used before or after establishing persistence.
6. However, the question specifically asks if they will use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence.
7. Based on the provided information, it is not explicitly stated that FIN13 uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE as a precursor to establishing persistence.
8. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that FIN13 might not necessarily use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before using other methods to establish persistence.

**Final Answer: B**
