**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the KONNI malware. The attack sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware uses an email attachment as the initial infection vector, followed by social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file, display a decoy document, and execute the malware on the victim's machine.
2. Execution: The malware executes arbitrary code on the infected host.
3. Persistence: The malware achieves persistence through various methods, including dropping files on the system, creating shortcuts, and modifying system settings.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware evolves over time, using multiple files, advanced decoy documents, and checks for previous versions of itself.
5. Credential Access: The malware steals keystrokes and credentials from browsers.
6. Command and Control: The malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections hosted by a free web hosting provider.
7. Exfiltration: The malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks whether the malware will steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline mentions that the malware steals keystrokes and screenshots, which are types of data that can be collected from the local system. However, it does not explicitly state that the malware steals files from the local system. The focus is on uploading stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the malware's primary focus is on collecting and uploading keystrokes and screenshots to the C2 infrastructure. While the malware does have the capability to steal credentials from browsers, there is no indication that it steals files from the local system. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the malware will not steal files from the local system as part of its collection process.

Final Answer: B
