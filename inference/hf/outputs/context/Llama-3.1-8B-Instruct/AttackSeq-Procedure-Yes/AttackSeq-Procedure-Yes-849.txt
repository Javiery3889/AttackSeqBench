**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the phases of a cyber attack in the order of:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks if attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data after discovering systems, users, and data relevant to the mission.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The CTI outline indicates that the attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

The question specifically asks about the sequence after Discovery. According to the CTI outline, after Discovery, the next phase is Collection. However, the question asks about installing persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to Collection.

The CTI outline does not explicitly state that persistence points are installed during lateral movement. However, it does mention that Persistence points are established in the target network to ensure ongoing access to the compromised network. This implies that persistence points are likely established after the initial access and execution phases, which is before lateral movement.

Given this information, it is likely that persistence points are established before lateral movement, not during lateral movement.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence of events is:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence (establishing persistence points in the target network)
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Collection

Lateral movement is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline, but it is implied to occur after Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion. Therefore, it is likely that persistence points are established before lateral movement.

The question asks if attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data. Based on the CTI outline, it is unlikely that persistence points are installed during lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B**
