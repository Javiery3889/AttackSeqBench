**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and use active discovery methods.
2. Initial Access: Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors, install BlackEnergy 3 on employee workstations, and enable macros to install the malware.
3. Execution: Adversaries install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
4. Credential Access: Adversaries use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log keystrokes, and use the stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new privileged accounts.
5. Command and Control: Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to an attacker-controlled CC server.
6. Discovery: Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand accessed, and use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that occurred after adversaries conducted internal reconnaissance on the control environment of critical systems and before adversaries used malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions internal reconnaissance on the control environment, which corresponds to Step 9 in the CTI outline: "Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network". The question also mentions the use of malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. However, this action is likely related to the "Impact" tactic, which is not a specific TTP but rather a consequence of the attack.

The correct answer choice should be the TTP that occurred after internal reconnaissance on the control environment and before the use of malicious updates to sever connections. Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence is:

Internal reconnaissance on the control environment (Step 9) -> Command and Control (Step 5)

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after internal reconnaissance on the control environment and before the use of malicious updates to sever connections between the control center and substations.
2. The CTI outline describes the attack sequence, which includes internal reconnaissance on the control environment (Step 9) and Command and Control (Step 5).
3. The correct answer choice should be the TTP that occurred after internal reconnaissance on the control environment and before the use of malicious updates to sever connections.
4. Based on the CTI outline, the correct sequence is: Internal reconnaissance on the control environment (Step 9) -> Command and Control (Step 5).
5. Therefore, the correct answer choice is B: Command and Control.

**Final Answer: B**
