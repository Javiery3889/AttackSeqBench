**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics and techniques used by the SideCopy APT group. The relevant sections for this question are:

- **Reconnaissance**: SideCopy uses decoys, honeytraps, and cloned websites to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent.
- **Resource Development**: SideCopy mimics the Sidewinder APT's infection chains to deliver their own malware, including njRAT with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
- **Initial Access**: SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables as entry points.
- **Execution**: SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins post-infection, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
- **Persistence**: SideCopy uses registry keys, VBScripts, and other techniques to maintain persistence on infected systems.
- **Exfiltration**: SideCopy targets Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India, and deploys njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks which MITRE ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred to enable njRAT deployments with victim-specific IDs of 'kavach'.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the tactic that enables the deployment of njRAT with victim-specific IDs of 'kavach'. Based on the CTI outline, this is related to the **Exfiltration** tactic, as it is mentioned that SideCopy targets Kavach and deploys njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.

However, the question is asking about the tactic that enables this deployment, not the deployment itself. The relevant section is **Persistence**, as it is mentioned that SideCopy uses registry keys and VBScripts to persist MargulasRAT, which is likely a precursor to deploying njRAT.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question is asking about the tactic that enables the deployment of njRAT with victim-specific IDs of 'kavach'.
2. The relevant section in the CTI outline is **Exfiltration**, but it is not the tactic that enables the deployment.
3. The **Persistence** tactic is mentioned as a precursor to deploying MargulasRAT, which is likely related to the deployment of njRAT.
4. Therefore, the most likely tactic that enables the deployment of njRAT with victim-specific IDs of 'kavach' is **Persistence**.

Final Answer: C
