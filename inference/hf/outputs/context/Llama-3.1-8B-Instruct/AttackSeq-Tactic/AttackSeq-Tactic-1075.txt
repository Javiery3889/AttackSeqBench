**Analysis of the CTI Outline:**

1. The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:
   - Initial Access (watering hole attack)
   - Execution (exploiting VBScript engine vulnerability, downloading and running a DLL, and executing a backdoor)
   - Persistence (SLUB backdoor achieves persistence)
   - Privilege Escalation (exploiting CVE-2015-1701 vulnerability)
   - Defense Evasion (downloader exits if it detects antivirus software processes)
   - Discovery (SLUB backdoor performs discovery by downloading a 'gist' snippet from GitHub and parsing it for commands to execute)
   - Command and Control (backdoor communicates with attackers via Slack)
   - Exfiltration (attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel)

2. **Analysis of the Question:**
   - The question asks about the next tactic after the attackers utilized the SLUB backdoor to perform discovery tasks.

3. **Comparison and Evaluation:**
   - The question mentions the SLUB backdoor performing discovery tasks, which is described in the CTI outline as part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The next tactic in the attack sequence after Discovery is Command and Control, as the backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used the SLUB backdoor to perform discovery tasks, which is a part of the Discovery tactic.
   - The next step in the attack sequence after Discovery is Command and Control, as the backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack.
   - Therefore, the most likely next tactic in the attack sequence is Command and Control.

**Final Answer: C**
