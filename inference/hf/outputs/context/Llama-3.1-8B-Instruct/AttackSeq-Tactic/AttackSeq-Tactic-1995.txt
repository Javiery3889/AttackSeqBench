**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The sequence of attack is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Lateral Movement
8. Collection
9. Command and Control
10. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after harvesting credentials using the Responder tool to prepare for lateral movement. The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before the attackers established network share and system information enumeration.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions "establishing network share and system information enumeration" which is related to the Lateral Movement tactic. The Credential Access tactic is mentioned before Lateral Movement in the CTI outline. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before the attackers established network share and system information enumeration is Credential Access.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after harvesting credentials using the Responder tool.
2. The CTI outline shows that Credential Access occurred before Lateral Movement.
3. The question specifically asks for the tactic that occurred before the attackers established network share and system information enumeration, which is part of Lateral Movement.
4. Therefore, the tactic that occurred before Lateral Movement is Credential Access.

Final Answer: D
