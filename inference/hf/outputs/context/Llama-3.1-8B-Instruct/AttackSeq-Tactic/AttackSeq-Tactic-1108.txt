**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack involving the Afghan Government compromise. The key details are:

- The attackers appended malicious code to the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file.
- The malicious code was obfuscated using the Dean Edwards Packer with base62 encoding.
- The attackers employed IP address whitelisting.
- The attackers used a specific malicious IP address (176.58.101.24) associated with Linode LLC.
- The attackers conducted a strategic web compromise.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence**

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access (strategic web compromise)
2. Defense Evasion (obfuscating the malicious code)
3. Defense Evasion (IP address whitelisting)

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

The question is asking about the sequence of TTPs after the initial access. Based on the CTI outline, the next steps would be Defense Evasion (obfuscating the malicious code) and Defense Evasion (IP address whitelisting).

**Step 5: Evaluate Answer Choices**

A: Command and Control - This is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs after the initial access.
B: Defense Evasion - This is the correct answer, as the attackers used Defense Evasion tactics to obfuscate the malicious code and employ IP address whitelisting.
C: Initial Access - This is the initial step, not the next step after the initial access.
D: Resource Development - This is not directly related to the sequence of TTPs after the initial access.

**Step 6: Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs after the attackers gained access to the Afghan Government's CDN server and conducted a strategic web compromise to modify the jquery-1.4.2.min.js file is Defense Evasion.

Final Answer: B
