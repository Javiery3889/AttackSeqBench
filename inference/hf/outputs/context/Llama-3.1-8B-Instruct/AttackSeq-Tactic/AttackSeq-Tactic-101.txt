**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sequence of attack methods used by attackers:

1. **Initial Access**: Attackers used malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files to gain access to the target system.
2. **Defense Evasion**: The attackers shifted from previous methods like XOR encoding and obfuscation to a new approach using PostScript syntax in EPS files to evade detection.
3. **Collection**: The report includes a collection of malicious HWP file samples discovered from January to May 2020.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of tactics after attackers exploited the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files but before they began altering PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files, which is related to **Initial Access**. The next step in the attack sequence mentioned in the CTI outline is **Defense Evasion**, where attackers altered PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection.

However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred **before** altering PostScript code in EPS files. The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the tactic that occurred between exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability and altering PostScript code. But, considering the context, it is likely that the attackers used the initial access to gain a foothold on the system and then used **Defense Evasion** to evade detection.

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** Defense Evasion. Given the context, it is likely that the attackers used **Initial Access** to gain access to the system, and then used Defense Evasion to evade detection.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct sequence of tactics is:

1. **Initial Access** (exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files)
2. **Defense Evasion** (altering PostScript code in EPS files to evade detection)

However, the question asks for the tactic that occurred **before** Defense Evasion. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
