**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN8 group in a cyber attack. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The FIN8 group uses a backdoor called BADHATCH to gain initial access to networks.
2. Execution: BADHATCH is executed, and it operates in two modes: CMD or POWERSHELL.
3. Persistence: FIN8 ensures persistence by using the WMI event subscription mechanism.
4. Privilege Escalation: The deployment of BADHATCH involves privilege escalation.
5. Defense Evasion: BADHATCH employs various defense evasion techniques.
6. Credential Access: Credential dumping is suggested by the execution of a script named mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
7. Discovery: The attackers conducted system fingerprinting using commands like systeminfo.exe, tasklist.exe, ipconfig.exe, net.exe, whoami.exe, and netstat.exe. They also discovered the Domain Controller and performed domain trust discovery using commands like nltest.exe and ping.exe.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic that occurred after FIN8 used commands like nltest.exe and ping.exe to discover the Domain Controller and perform domain trust discovery.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of wmic.exe to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller. Based on the CTI outline, the attack sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The FIN8 group uses a backdoor called BADHATCH to gain initial access to networks.
2. Execution: BADHATCH is executed, and it operates in two modes: CMD or POWERSHELL.
3. Persistence: FIN8 ensures persistence by using the WMI event subscription mechanism.
4. Privilege Escalation: The deployment of BADHATCH involves privilege escalation.
5. Defense Evasion: BADHATCH employs various defense evasion techniques.
6. Credential Access: Credential dumping is suggested by the execution of a script named mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
7. Discovery: The attackers conducted system fingerprinting using commands like systeminfo.exe, tasklist.exe, ipconfig.exe, net.exe, whoami.exe, and netstat.exe. They also discovered the Domain Controller and performed domain trust discovery using commands like nltest.exe and ping.exe.

The question asks about the next tactic after domain trust discovery. Based on the attack sequence, the next tactic is likely to be Lateral Movement, as the attackers would need to move laterally within the network to execute the BADHATCH deployment script on the Domain Controller using wmic.exe.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
