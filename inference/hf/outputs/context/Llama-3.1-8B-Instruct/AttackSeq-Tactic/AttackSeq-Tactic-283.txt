**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the development and sale of new hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services for cybercriminals. It also mentions the Chinese underground market offering social engineering toolkits, such as Social Engineering Master. The report highlights the growth of the carding enterprise in the Chinese cybercriminal underground, driven by the growth of noncash transactions.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence in the Order Presented by the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics**

The attack sequence can be inferred as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The report mentions the use of leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering, which is a form of reconnaissance.
2. **Resource Development**: The development and sale of new hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services for cybercriminals, indicate resource development.
3. **Impact**: The report discusses the impact of the carding enterprise on SMBs, indicating the impact tactic.

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after cybercriminals leveraged leaked-data search engines like SheYun for intelligence gathering.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically asks about the sequence of TTPs after reconnaissance. Based on the attack sequence identified in the CTI outline, the next step after reconnaissance is resource development.

**Step 5: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after reconnaissance.
2. The CTI outline indicates that the next step after reconnaissance is resource development.
3. Resource development involves the development and sale of new hardware like PoS and ATM skimmers, along with training services for cybercriminals.
4. Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is reconnaissance followed by resource development.

**Final Answer: C**
