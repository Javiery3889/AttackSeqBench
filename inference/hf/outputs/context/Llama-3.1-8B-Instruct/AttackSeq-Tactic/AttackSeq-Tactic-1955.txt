**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the OceanLotus backdoor's behavior in the following order:

1. Initial Access: The backdoor is distributed via a zip file, which is delivered through an email attachment.
2. Execution: The backdoor executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.
3. Persistence: The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up and copies itself to a new location.
4. Defense Evasion: The backdoor employs a robust string encoding mechanism and a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
5. Discovery: The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server.
6. Others: The backdoor includes improvements such as a decoy document, custom binary protocol traffic with encryption, and a modularized structure.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the next tactic that occurred after the backdoor surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server, using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the backdoor using a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443 after surveying the victim's computer and sending information to a remote server. This matches the behavior described in the CTI outline under the "Defense Evasion" section, where the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.

However, the question specifically mentions the use of AES encryption on TCP port 443, which is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI outline. But, it is implied that the custom binary protocol with encryption is used for communication with the command and control server.

Given the context, the next tactic that occurred after the backdoor surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server is likely related to communicating with the command and control server.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

1. The backdoor surveyed the victim's computer and sent information to a remote server, which matches the "Discovery" tactic.
2. The question mentions the use of a custom binary protocol with AES encryption on TCP port 443, which is related to communication with the command and control server.
3. The "Command and Control" tactic involves communication between the malware and its command and control server, which matches the behavior described in the question.

Final Answer: C
