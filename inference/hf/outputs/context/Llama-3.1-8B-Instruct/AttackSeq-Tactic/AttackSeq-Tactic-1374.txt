**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the FIN13 threat actor. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Defense Evasion
7. Credential Access
8. Lateral Movement
9. Collection
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13. Specifically, it asks what tactic occurred before FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions that FIN13 used techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting. This is related to the "Credential Access" tactic.

The question also mentions that FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations. This is related to the "Discovery" tactic.

Based on the attack sequence, "Credential Access" occurs before "Discovery". Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that occurs before "Discovery".

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the sequence of TTPs used by FIN13.
2. The question mentions that FIN13 used techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and targeting unsecured credentials for credential harvesting, which is related to "Credential Access".
3. The question also mentions that FIN13 used native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information on network and host configurations, which is related to "Discovery".
4. Based on the attack sequence, "Credential Access" occurs before "Discovery".
5. Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that occurs before "Discovery".

Final Answer: D
