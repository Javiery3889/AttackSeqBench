**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence of the ATMitch malware, which includes:

1. Initial Access: The malware was manually installed on the victim ATM.
2. Execution: The malware injects its payload into the 'fwmain32.exe' process using the 'SetThreadContext' injection technique.
3. Defense Evasion: The malware disguises its payload and uses thread hijacking to inject the payload into the target process.
4. Discovery: The malware targets the 'fwmain32.exe' process, indicating its awareness of the banking environment.
5. Command and Control: The malware reads commands from a file in the 'c:\intel' folder and logs actions into 'c:\intel\__log.txt'.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that occurred when the malware dispensed cash by interacting with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the malware's operational mechanism of reading commands from a file and logging actions into a local directory. This is related to the Command and Control tactic described in the CTI outline.

The interaction with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library is likely related to the Impact tactic, which involves disrupting or manipulating the normal functioning of the system or data.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The malware's operational mechanism involves reading commands from a file and logging actions, which is related to Command and Control.
2. The interaction with ATM components using the 'msxfs.dll' library is likely related to Impact, as it involves manipulating the normal functioning of the system (the ATM).
3. The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the malware dispensed cash, which is a result of the Impact tactic.
4. The other options (Credential Access and Initial Access) are not directly related to the malware's interaction with ATM components.

**Final Answer: B**
