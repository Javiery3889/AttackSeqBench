**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the attack sequence used by Russian-speaking cybercriminals, which includes:

1. Initial Access (spear-phishing, phishing mass-mailing, compromised websites)
2. Execution (downloading programs for remote, hidden administration)
3. Discovery (using remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials and explore financial systems)
4. Impact (transferring money from the organization's accounts)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after executing remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions executing remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials, which is part of the Execution phase. The next step in the attack sequence described in the CTI outline is the Discovery phase, where cybercriminals use remote administration tools to explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI outline, the correct answer is the next step after executing remote administration tools to gain system administrators' credentials.

The Discovery phase is the next step in the attack sequence, which involves using remote administration tools to explore the financial systems of the targeted organization.

Final Answer: B
