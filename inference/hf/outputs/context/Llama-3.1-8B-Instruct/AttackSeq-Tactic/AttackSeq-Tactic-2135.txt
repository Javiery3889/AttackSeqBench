**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence by APT15, a threat actor, against a global company that provides services to the UK government. The sequence includes:

1. Initial Access: APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
2. Execution: APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
3. Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials, which facilitated further actions within the network.
4. Defense Evasion: RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
5. Credential Access: APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
6. Collection: APT15 used various tools to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory, databases, Microsoft Sharepoint, and Microsoft Exchange.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred after APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The RoyalDNS backdoor is mentioned in the Execution phase of the attack sequence. Since it installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate, it is likely that the next step would involve using this backdoor to access and exfiltrate data from the network.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. APT15 deployed the RoyalDNS backdoor, which installs persistently on the victim's network and uses DNS to communicate.
2. This backdoor would allow APT15 to access and exfiltrate data from the network.
3. The most likely ATT&CK tactic that occurred after deploying the RoyalDNS backdoor is Exfiltration, as it involves the unauthorized transfer of data from the victim's network.

Final Answer: D
