**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Gamaredon group. The sequence of attack is as follows:

1. Initial Access: Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments
2. Execution: Malicious DLLs, scripting (Batch files and VBScript), and user execution of email attachments
3. Persistence: Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents
4. Defense Evasion: Obfuscated files, registry key modifications, code signing, and deobfuscation
5. Discovery: Backdoors listing interesting files on a system
6. Lateral Movement: Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macros to send malicious attachments
7. Command and Control: Using HTTP and HTTPS for C2
8. Exfiltration: Uploading harvested documents to the C2 server

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the tactic that occurred after employing backdoors to automatically list interesting files on a system and leveraging malicious macros in Word and Excel documents for propagating through Outlook VBA macros. The question focuses on the discovery of sensitive documents across local systems and mounted drives.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the use of backdoors to list interesting files and the propagation of malicious macros through Outlook VBA macros. This corresponds to the Discovery tactic in the CTI outline, where the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.

The other options do not match the sequence of events described in the question:

* Privilege Escalation (A) is not mentioned in the context of the question.
* Command and Control (C) is a separate tactic that occurs later in the attack sequence.
* Credential Access (D) is not mentioned in the context of the question.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the tactic that corresponds to the Discovery phase, where the group's backdoors list interesting files on a system.

Final Answer: B
