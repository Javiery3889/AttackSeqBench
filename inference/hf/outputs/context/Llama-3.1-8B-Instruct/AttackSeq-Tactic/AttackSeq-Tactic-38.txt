**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with embedded macros that deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to the target systems.
2. Initial Access: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through the phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. Execution: Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute, calling a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
4. Defense Evasion: The PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
5. Command and Control: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
6. Execution (again): The GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware were activated on the compromised system.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the ATT&CK tactic that most likely occurred when the GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware were activated on the compromised system.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the PowerShell script communicating with hardcoded C2 servers to download resources, which is part of the Command and Control tactic. However, the question asks about the tactic that occurred when the GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware were activated. This implies that the tactic in question is the one that occurs after the Command and Control tactic.

Based on the attack sequence, the next tactic after Command and Control is Execution, which is when the GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware are activated on the compromised system.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to download resources, which is part of the Command and Control tactic.
2. The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware were activated on the compromised system.
3. Based on the attack sequence, the next tactic after Command and Control is Execution.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that corresponds to the Execution tactic.

Final Answer: D
