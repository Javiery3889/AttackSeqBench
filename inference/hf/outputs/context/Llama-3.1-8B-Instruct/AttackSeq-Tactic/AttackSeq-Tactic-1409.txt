**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes the Smooth Operator malware's behavior, including its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The order of the TTPs is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The malware infects victims when they install specific trojanized versions of the 3CX software.
2. Execution: The malware executes as part of the 3CX software, creating a new thread to run its functionality.
3. Persistence: The malware persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package.
4. Defense Evasion: The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including daemonizing and detaching from the 3CX process, deleting itself from disk, and writing configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory.
5. Discovery: The malware collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version, domain, and account name values.
6. Collection: The malware stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration.
7. Command and Control: The malware communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
8. Exfiltration: The malware automatically exfiltrates collected data, not over the existing C2 channel.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred after a trojanized version of the 3CX software was distributed in a supply chain attack, allowing Smooth Operator malware to infiltrate macOS systems.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the CTI outline, the first TTP that occurred after the malware was distributed in a supply chain attack is Initial Access. This is because the malware infects victims when they install specific trojanized versions of the 3CX software.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The question asks about the initial action taken by the malware after it was distributed in a supply chain attack.
2. The CTI outline states that the malware infects victims when they install specific trojanized versions of the 3CX software, which is the Initial Access tactic.
3. The other options (Discovery, Credential Access, and Execution) are subsequent TTPs that occur after Initial Access.

**Final Answer: D**
