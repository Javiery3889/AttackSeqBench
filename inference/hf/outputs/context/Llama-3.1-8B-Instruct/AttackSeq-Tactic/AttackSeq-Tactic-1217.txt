**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a series of attacks by the Evil Corp group using the SocGholish framework to deploy WastedLocker ransomware. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access (via SocGholish framework)
3. Execution (Cobalt Strike Beacon payload)
4. Privilege Escalation (using slui.exe and wmic.exe)
5. Defense Evasion (using PsExec to disable Windows Defender and stop services)
6. Credential Access (using Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and log file emptying)
7. Discovery (profiling the computer using various commands)
8. Lateral Movement (using Cobalt Strike Beacon for remote execution and process injection)
9. Command and Control (communication with a C&C domain)

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs after the attackers used the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for communication with a command and control domain as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question specifically mentions the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicating with a C&C domain, which is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic. The next logical step after C2 would be to maintain access and control over the compromised systems, which is typically achieved through Lateral Movement.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

1. The attackers used the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload for communication with a C&C domain, which is part of the Command and Control (C2) tactic.
2. The next logical step after C2 would be to maintain access and control over the compromised systems.
3. Lateral Movement is the tactic that involves moving within the network to maintain access and control over the compromised systems.
4. Therefore, the most likely next tactic after C2 is Lateral Movement.

Final Answer: D
