**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack sequence involving the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

1. Initial Access: Exploiting a zero-day exploit in Chrome and a Windows EoP exploit to gain system privileges.
2. Privilege Escalation: Utilizing two distinct Windows OS kernel vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956) to obtain kernel addresses and create arbitrary memory read and write primitives.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the next tactic after exploiting Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions gaining arbitrary memory read and write capabilities, which is a result of the Privilege Escalation tactic. The next logical step would be to use these capabilities for further actions, such as communicating with a C&C server.

**Step 4: Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. The attackers have already exploited Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary memory read and write capabilities.
2. The next step would involve using these capabilities to communicate with a C&C server for additional actions.
3. This action is most likely related to Command and Control (C2), as it involves communication with a server for further instructions or data exchange.

**Final Answer: D: Command and Control**
