**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes an attack sequence involving Operation Pawn Storm, an iOS malware, and its capabilities. The key points are:

- Initial Access: The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- Discovery: The malware collects various types of information from the iOS device, including text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and more.
- Command and Control: The malware sends the collected information via HTTP, using POST and GET requests, and can also upload files via FTP.

**Step 2: Identify the Attack Sequence**

The attack sequence in the order presented by the MITRE ATT&CK tactics is:

1. Initial Access (malware installation)
2. Execution (malware execution)
3. Discovery (information collection)
4. Command and Control (data exfiltration and communication)

**Step 3: Analyze the Question**

The question asks for the tactic that occurred after the iOS malware was installed but before it started gathering information.

**Step 4: Compare and Evaluate**

Based on the attack sequence identified, the tactic that occurred after the Initial Access (malware installation) but before the Discovery (information collection) is Execution. This is because the malware needs to be executed on the compromised system before it can start collecting information.

**Step 5: Final Answer**

The correct answer is the tactic that occurred after Initial Access but before Discovery.

Final Answer: A
