**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the CEIDPageLock rootkit. The sequence is as follows:

1. Initial Access: The rootkit is distributed by the RIG Exploit kit.
2. Persistence: The dropper extracts the driver from the file and saves it in the Windows Temp directory as houzi.sys.
3. Persistence: The driver is registered and started.
4. Command and Control: The driver connects with one of two C&C hard-coded domains to download the desired homepage configuration.
5. Collection: Browsing data is gathered on victims.
6. Command and Control: The driver tampers with the browser's homepage.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the driver employed tricks to hide from security products during startup. The relevant TTPs mentioned in the question are:

1. Extracting and saving the malicious driver in the Windows Temp directory.
2. Employing tricks to hide from security products during startup.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The relevant TTPs mentioned in the question match the Persistence tactic in the CTI outline, specifically the step where the driver is registered and started. The driver's ability to hide from security products during startup is a technique used to maintain persistence.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

The question asks about the tactic that occurred when the driver employed tricks to hide from security products during startup. Based on the CTI outline, this event occurred during the Persistence tactic, specifically when the driver was registered and started.

Final Answer: D
