**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The key details are:

- Initial Access: Cobalt Strike's beacon is used for backdoor installation and execution.
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers use Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz feature to steal account information and UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
- Defense Evasion: Cobalt Strike provides techniques to bypass detection by security products.
- Discovery: Attackers use ADFind and port scanning to collect network information after gaining escalated privileges.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the next ATT&CK tactic after gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning. The question mentions propagating beacons to other systems within the company's network.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The extracted attack sequence from the CTI outline is:

1. Initial Access (Cobalt Strike's beacon installation and execution)
2. Privilege Escalation (using Cobalt Strike's Mimikatz feature and UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities)
3. Discovery (using ADFind and port scanning)
4. Lateral Movement (propagating beacons to other systems within the company's network)

The question specifically mentions propagating beacons to other systems, which aligns with the Lateral Movement tactic.

**Step 4: Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct sequence of TTPs is:

1. Discovery (gathering network information through ADFind and port scanning)
2. Lateral Movement (propagating beacons to other systems within the company's network)

The correct answer choice is D: Lateral Movement, as it is the next logical step after gathering network information.

Final Answer: D
