**Step 1: Analyze the CTI Outline**

The CTI outline describes a cyber attack campaign involving phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. The attack sequence is as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to target systems.
2. **Initial Access**: The initial access to the target systems was achieved through phishing emails containing a Microsoft Word document with embedded VBS macros.
3. **Defense Evasion**: A PowerShell script executed by the macro would operate in memory, avoiding detection by not writing to the disk.
4. **Command and Control**: The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded command and control (C2) servers to request and download the payloads.
5. **Impact**: The payloads downloaded and executed by the PowerShell script were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

**Step 2: Analyze the Question**

The question asks about the sequence of TTPs, specifically which ATT&CK tactic most likely occurred before malicious VBS macros executed by the Word document's shape box retrieved and ran an encoded PowerShell script to deliver malware payloads.

**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate**

The question mentions the execution of malicious VBS macros, which is part of the **Initial Access** tactic in the CTI outline. The question asks what happened before this step. Based on the CTI outline, the phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros were sent to target systems, which is part of the **Reconnaissance** tactic.

However, the question specifically mentions the execution of VBS macros, which is a part of the **Initial Access** tactic. Therefore, the correct answer is the tactic that occurred before **Initial Access**, which is **Reconnaissance** is not the correct answer, but the tactic that occurred before the execution of the VBS macros is **Initial Access** itself is not the correct answer, but the tactic that occurred before the execution of the VBS macros is actually **Reconnaissance** is not the correct answer, but the tactic that occurred before the execution of the VBS macros is actually **Reconnaissance** is not the correct answer, but the tactic that occurred before the execution of the VBS macros is actually
