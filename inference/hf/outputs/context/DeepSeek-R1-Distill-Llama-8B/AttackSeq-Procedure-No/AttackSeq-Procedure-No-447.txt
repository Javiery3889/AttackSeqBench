Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius would deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware before the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicates with C2 servers to send recon or download files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It describes the attack sequence used by Agrius, which is a cyber threat group. The outline is divided into four main sections: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control.

Starting with Initial Access, Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically targeting FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and using SQL injection. This allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

In Execution, they deployed a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor is used for exfiltration, deploying more malware, and has persistence as a registered service. It can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration from C2 servers.

Moving on to Persistence, they used webshells and registered 'IPsec Helper' as a service to maintain access. This makes sense because once a backdoor is registered as a service, it's harder to remove.

For Defense Evasion, they used obfuscated webshells, like ASPXSpy, and the backdoor had self-deletion functionality to avoid detection.

Lateral Movement involved using webshells for RDP tunneling and compromised accounts for moving across the network. They also used tools for credential harvesting.

Command and Control is handled by 'IPsec Helper' communicating over HTTP with C2 servers. The configuration file has encrypted server addresses. The backdoor waits for commands, which include updating relays, sending recon (reconnaissance), downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is about whether 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' are deployed before the 'IPsec Helper' sends recon or downloads files via C2. The options are Yes or No.

From the outline, the 'IPsec Helper' is the primary tool used for communication. It's mentioned that after initial access and execution, it's deployed for persistence and command and control. The 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' are mentioned in the context of data destruction activities, but the outline doesn't explicitly state when they are used.

I don't see any mention of 'Apostle' or 'DEADWOOD' being used before the 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2. The sequence seems to be: initial access, then 'IPsec Helper' deployment, followed by persistence and lateral movement. The C2 communication via 'IPsec Helper' comes after these steps. Since the question is about whether these wipers are deployed before the C2 communication, and the outline doesn't indicate that 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' are used at this stage, it's likely that they are not deployed before the C2 communication happens. Therefore, the answer should be No.

The analysis indicates that 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' are not mentioned as being used before the 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers. The attack sequence focuses on initial access, execution, persistence, and command and control without mentioning these wipers at this stage.

Final Answer: B: No
