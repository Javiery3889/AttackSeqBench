Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attack mentioned in the CTI outline involved using social media channels to deliver malicious files before downloading Crimson RAT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It describes a cyber attack that used a malicious document with a macro which executed to drop a Crimson RAT downloader. This payload then downloaded a fully functional Crimson RAT from an IP address, 151.106.19.207:8246. The RAT was placed in the ProgramData folder. The payload also had the ability to kill processes, which is a form of defense evasion. Additionally, the RAT had keylogging and browser credential theft capabilities. It could receive commands from a C&C server and perform various actions like listing processes, checking antivirus status, downloading files, updating binaries, and sending disk information. 

The CTI outline also mentions that a similar document, 'MoFA-MoDAfghanistan.xls', was found earlier, uploaded in August 2018. This file had malicious macros that downloaded a payload from 'http://afgcloud7.com/upld/updt.dll'. It references a 2016 Proofpoint report on Operation Transparent Tribe, which targeted Indian Embassies using Crimson RAT and used the same URL. This suggests that the same group might be active again, targeting Indian officials.

Now, the question is whether the attack used social media to deliver malicious files before downloading Crimson RAT. The CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention social media channels being used in the attack described. It focuses on the use of a malicious document, which is a common method for phishing, but doesn't specify the delivery method beyond that. The 'Others' section talks about a previous campaign using a similar URL but doesn't add any info on social media use.

Looking at the answer choices, A says "Yes" and B says "No." Since the CTI outline doesn't mention social media as part of the attack described, I can't confirm that it was used. However, the previous campaign mentioned did use a similar URL, but there's no direct link to social media in the current attack described. So, without explicit mention, it's safer to say "No."
</think>

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of social media channels in the attack described. It focuses on a malicious document and the subsequent download of Crimson RAT, without detailing the delivery method beyond the document. While a previous campaign used a similar URL, there's no indication of social media use in the current attack. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the attack did not involve social media.

Final Answer: B
