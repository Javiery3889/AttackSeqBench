Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware app, after uploading files via FTP, sends the gathered information via HTTP only after performing certain routines on the iOS device. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It talks about an iOS malware called XAgent, which is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows. The malware is installed on compromised systems, and it's active on iOS 7 but not on 8, which makes sense because iOS 8 was released in 2014, so the malware was likely developed before that.

Looking at the Execution section, the app is hidden on iOS 7 but not on 8, and it restarts when terminated. This suggests it's persistent and evasive, which is common in malware to avoid detection.

Now, the Discovery section lists what the app can do: collect text messages, contacts, pictures, location data, start voice recording, get lists of installed apps and processes, and check Wi-Fi status. So, the app is pretty intrusive, gathering a lot of personal data.

The question is about whether the app sends the collected data via HTTP after using FTP. The options are Yes or No.

I know that FTP is an older, less secure protocol, often used for file transfers. HTTP is more common for data transmission, especially for sending data to a command and control (C2) server. Malware often uses multiple protocols to avoid detection, switching between them based on certain conditions.

The CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention the use of HTTP after FTP, but it does say the app collects a lot of data. Malware typically centralizes this data, so after collecting, it would need to send it somewhere, probably via a protocol like HTTP or HTTPS. Since FTP is mentioned as the method for uploading files, it's possible that other data is sent via HTTP, especially if the C2 is set up to handle different transfer methods.

Also, considering that the app runs in the background and is evasive, it's likely designed to send data securely, possibly using HTTP over HTTPS to avoid detection. So, after collecting data via FTP, it's plausible that the app uses HTTP for transmission, especially if the C2 is expecting it.

Therefore, the answer is likely Yes.

The malware uses FTP to upload files and, given its nature and the need for secure data transmission, it's probable that it then sends the collected data via HTTP. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
