Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in this case would stop specific services related to backups before changing the victims' Instagram passwords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attackers targeted Instagram users, particularly influencers. They used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to trick victims into giving their credentials. The phishing sites they used were designed to look like Instagram's interface, which probably means they could collect more information effectively.

After obtaining the credentials, the attackers changed the passwords, which locked out the original owners. They also downloaded all images and messages, either manually or through Instagram's data backup. So, their main actions after credential collection were password changes and data extraction.

The question is whether they would stop specific services related to backups before changing the passwords. So, I'm thinking about the typical behavior of cyber attackers. Usually, once they have access to a compromised account, their priority is to secure their access by changing passwords to prevent the victim from regaining control. They might also download as much data as possible to maximize the information they can use or sell.

Stopping backup services could be an additional step, but it's not clear from the outline if that happened here. The outline mentions they used Instagram's data backup feature to download content, which suggests they might have accessed backups. However, it doesn't explicitly say they disabled backup services. The main actions mentioned are changing passwords and downloading data.

So, the key points are: after getting credentials, they changed passwords and downloaded data. There's no mention of disabling backup services, so it's possible but not certain. However, since the question is about whether they would stop the services before changing passwords, and the outline doesn't specify that, the more likely scenario is that they would change the passwords first to lock out the victim, and then handle data extraction, possibly using existing backup features without necessarily stopping the service.

Therefore, the answer is probably "No," they wouldn't stop the backup services before changing the passwords.

The attackers' primary actions after obtaining credentials were changing passwords to lock out victims and downloading data. The CTI outline doesn't mention disabling backup services, so it's more likely they didn't stop them before changing passwords.

Final Answer: B: No
