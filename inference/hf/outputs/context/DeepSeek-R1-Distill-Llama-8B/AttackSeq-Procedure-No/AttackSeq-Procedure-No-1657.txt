Okay, so I need to figure out whether the FHAPPI campaign used fileless techniques after establishing a connection with their C2 server at 61.97.243.15. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the initial access was through a phishing email with a link to a Geocities site hosting VBScript malware. The VBScript then executed a PowerShell command to download a .ps1 file. The .ps1 file had more base64 encoded code, which when decoded, infected both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The malware masqueraded as a security update and used PowerShell to execute more base64 code.

So, the process involved multiple layers of base64 encoding. The VBScript runs PowerShell commands, which in turn execute more PowerShell scripts. This seems like a fileless technique because the malicious code is being executed from memory rather than from a file on disk. The fact that the code is base64 encoded suggests that it's being delivered as a string within another file or command, which is a common fileless technique.

The C2 server is mentioned as 61.97.243.15, which is a dial-up IP in South Korea. The domain used is 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to someone in China. The campaign was first recognized in Japan, targeting Mongolian users with Mongolian documents.

The question is whether they used fileless techniques after connecting to the C2 server. From the outline, the initial VBScript runs PowerShell commands, which then execute more PowerShell code. This indicates that the attack is using fileless techniques because the malicious code is being executed from memory, not from a static file. The use of base64 encoding within the PowerShell commands also supports this, as it's a common method for evading detection by delivering malicious code as a string.

So, after establishing a connection to the C2 server, the campaign likely continued using fileless techniques to avoid detection by not leaving malicious code on the disk. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The FHAPPI campaign utilized fileless techniques by executing malicious code through PowerShell commands after establishing a C2 connection, avoiding detection by not storing malicious code on the disk.

Final Answer: A: Yes
