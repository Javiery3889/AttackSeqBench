Okay, so I need to figure out whether the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will use the FTP protocol for C2 communication after the custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The Harvester group uses a custom backdoor named Backdoor.Graphon, along with a custom downloader and a screenshot tool. The screenshot tool captures screenshots and saves them into a password-protected ZIP archive for collection. The question is about whether the backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon use FTP for C2.

From the outline, under the Execution section, it says that Backdoor.Graphon is used for executing commands, capturing user activities, and facilitating remote access. So, the backdoor is already a tool for remote access, which suggests it's used for C2 communication. But the question is specifically about whether it uses FTP.

Looking at the Persistence section, the group uses a registry value to create a persistence point. That's standard for maintaining access, but it doesn't mention the protocol used for communication. The Defense Evasion section mentions using CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C, which implies they might be using HTTP or HTTPS, not FTP. Also, the decoy URL is using HTTPS, which is common for avoiding detection.

The Collection step uses a screenshot tool that saves to a ZIP archive, but that's for data collection, not for C2. The Others section mentions that the group is an espionage effort, using custom tools and evading detection.

Now, considering the answer choices: A says yes, B says no. Since the backdoor is for remote access, it's likely using a protocol like HTTP or HTTPS, not FTP. FTP is less common nowadays and is easier to detect. The group seems to be using more sophisticated methods, so using FTP for C2 is less likely. Therefore, the answer is B: No.

The analysis indicates that the custom backdoor and Cobalt Strike Beacon are unlikely to use FTP for C2 communication, as the group employs modern methods like CloudFront and HTTPS, which are more common and evasive.

Final Answer: B
