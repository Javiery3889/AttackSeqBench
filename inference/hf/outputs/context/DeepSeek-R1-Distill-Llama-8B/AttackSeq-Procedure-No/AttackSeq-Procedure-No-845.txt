Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Office document delivered by the KerrDown malware uses base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that KerrDown is a custom downloader used by the OceanLotus group (APT32) since early 2018. It's delivered through two methods: Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros and RAR archives that trick the targets, often with Vietnamese file names, suggesting targets in Vietnam or Vietnamese speakers.

Next, the defense evasion section says that the actors used a VBS decode function from Motobit to decode base64 blobs. The KerrDown DLL is saved in a specific directory, and it retrieves the payload from a URL. It decrypts the payload using the DES algorithm and executes it in memory. This means the payload isn't written to the system; instead, it's run directly from memory. The key point here is that the payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, which is a commercial tool used by various threat actors.

Now, the question is about whether the Office document uses base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the system architecture only, before containing an image file telling the victim to enable macros. From the outline, KerrDown uses a VBS decode function to handle base64 blobs. So, when the Office document is opened, it likely triggers the macro, which then uses this function to decode the payload. The payload is then executed in memory, which aligns with the description of using base64 blobs for execution.

The question is specifically about whether this happens based on the system architecture. The outline doesn't mention system architecture being a factor in the use of base64 blobs. Instead, it's more about the method of delivery and the use of a VBS function for decoding. So, the execution isn't dependent on the system's architecture but rather on the presence of the macro and the use of the VBS function.

Additionally, the outline mentions that the KerrDown DLL is dropped as 'main_background.png' in a specific directory, which might trick the user into thinking it's a harmless image file. However, the main point is the use of base64 decoding via VBS, not the system architecture.

So, putting it all together, the Office document uses base64 blobs for the payload execution through the VBS function, regardless of the system architecture. Therefore, the answer should be "Yes," as the base64 blobs are used based on the presence of the macro and the VBS function, not the system architecture.

The Office document uses base64 blobs to execute the payload through a VBS function, not dependent on system architecture. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
