Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase after using certain tools for reconnaissance on medical infrastructure. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that the attackers used masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical keywords. They also used Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources of these organizations. So, they're doing active reconnaissance to find targets.

Then, they found non-trivial ports and services, specifically Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces that don't require authentication. These seem like they could be exploited for further reconnaissance. So, the attackers are looking for specific types of systems that might be vulnerable.

The question is about whether metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase. I'm not entirely sure what "metadata" refers to here, but I think it's data about the files, like their names, types, creation dates, etc. File and directory listings would be like the contents of a directory, which includes filenames and subdirectories.

Looking at the tools used: masscan is a network scanning tool that can discover open ports and services. Shodan is a search engine for intelligence on open ports and services. Censys is another tool that can provide information on network devices and their configurations.

Now, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention tools that would extract file metadata. Tools like masscan are more about network scanning and identifying open ports, not about accessing files or their contents. Shodan and Censys are more about finding and identifying network devices and services, not about extracting file information.

However, the attackers might use other tools for further reconnaissance. For example, once they identify a vulnerable printer with an unauthenticated web interface, they might try to access it to gather more information. If the printer's web interface is misconfigured, they might be able to access files or directories, which could include metadata. But the outline doesn't specify that they actually did this.

The question is about whether this is "likely" to happen. The outline mentions that they found these systems, so it's possible they would attempt to exploit them. If the printers have web interfaces without authentication, it's easy for attackers to access them. Once they're in, they might be able to download files or list directories, which would include metadata.

But wait, the outline doesn't mention any actual access to files or metadata. It just talks about identifying potential entry points. So maybe the answer is that it's not certain because the outline doesn't explicitly say they accessed files. However, the question is about likelihood. Since they found unauthenticated printers, it's more probable they would try to access them, which could lead to retrieving metadata.

Alternatively, maybe the tools they used (masscan, Shodan, Censys) don't retrieve file metadata. Those tools are more about network discovery. So perhaps the answer is no because the tools used don't do that. But the mention of exploiting the printer's web interface suggests that they might have access to more information, including files and their metadata.

I'm a bit confused. On one hand, the tools used don't directly retrieve file metadata. On the other hand, if they exploit the printer's web interface, they might. The question is about likelihood. Since the outline mentions they found such systems, it's likely they would attempt to exploit them, so metadata retrieval is probable.

The attackers identified unauthenticated printers with web interfaces, which they could exploit to access files and directories, potentially retrieving metadata. While the initial tools (masscan, Shodan, Censys) don't retrieve file metadata, the likelihood of doing so increases with further exploitation of found vulnerabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
