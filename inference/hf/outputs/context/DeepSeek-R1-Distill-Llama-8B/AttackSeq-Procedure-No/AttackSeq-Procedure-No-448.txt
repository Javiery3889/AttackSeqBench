Okay, so I need to figure out whether Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper after the 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers to send recon info or download files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes Agrius' tactics, which are organized into four main sections: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Defense Evasion. Each section gives specific details about how Agrius gains access, deploys malware, and evades detection.

Starting with Initial Access, Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically targeting FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and using SQL injection. This allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP. So, their initial entry point is through these vulnerabilities, and they use webshells as a stepping stone.

Next, Execution: They deploy a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor is registered as a service, which means it's persistent. It can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration. This shows that once they have a foothold, they quickly establish persistence and control over the system.

Looking at Persistence, they use webshells and the 'IPsec Helper' service. This reinforces their ability to maintain access, which is crucial for further activities.

Defense Evasion: They use obfuscated webshells, like ASPXSpy, and the backdoor has self-deletion functionality. This means they're actively trying to cover their tracks, which suggests they might be preparing for more destructive actions once they have what they need.

Lateral Movement: They use webshells to tunnel RDP and leverage compromised accounts. They also use tools for credential harvesting, which helps them move within the network. This phase is about expanding their access and gathering more data.

Command and Control: The 'IPsec Helper' communicates via HTTP with C2 servers. The configuration file has encrypted server addresses, so it's not directly sending data without a command. When it receives a command, it can do things like update relays, send recon info, download files, or delete itself.

Now, the question is about whether CaddyWiper is deployed after the 'IPsec Helper' sends recon info or downloads files. CaddyWiper is a tool used for data destruction, specifically targeting OT (Operational Technology) capabilities, mapped drives, and physical drive partitions.

I need to see if there's any indication in the CTI outline that Agrius uses such tools. The outline mentions webshells, credential harvesting, and lateral movement, but doesn't explicitly mention CaddyWiper. However, the fact that they're using a backdoor for persistence and have a focus on data exfiltration and evasion suggests they might escalate to data destruction.

CaddyWiper is often used in the data destruction phase after initial access and lateral movement to erase sensitive data. Since the 'IPsec Helper' is used for command execution and data handling, it's plausible that after gathering necessary information or when the time is right, they would deploy CaddyWiper to wipe specific data.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Based on the behavior described, especially the focus on persistence, evasion, and the use of a backdoor for command execution, it's likely they would deploy CaddyWiper as part of their data destruction activities.

The analysis indicates that Agrius, after establishing command execution through the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor, is likely to deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction. The group's tactics suggest a progression from initial access to persistence, lateral movement, and eventual data destruction, aligning with the use of CaddyWiper.

Final Answer: A
