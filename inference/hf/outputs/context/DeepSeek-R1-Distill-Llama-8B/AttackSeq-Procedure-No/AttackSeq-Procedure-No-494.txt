Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Jupyter infostealer uses steganography to hide its C2 communications, send collected data, and undergo version upgrades. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack chain of the Jupyter infostealer. It starts with an initial access via a zip file that looks legitimate, like a Docx2Rtf installer. The installer is designed to evade detection, which is a red flag. Once executed, it injects a .NET C2 client into memory and then uses PowerShell to download a module that's the actual infostealer.

Moving on to execution, the infostealer uses Process Hollowing to inject shellcode into legitimate apps like msinfo32.exe. It also uses PowerShell to decrypt a base64 blob and run the infostealer module in memory. So far, no mention of steganography here.

Looking at persistence, the newer versions use PoshC2, creating a LNK file in the startup folder. That's about persistence, not steganography. For defense evasion, the infostealer copies stolen data to another directory to avoid triggering alerts and uses obfuscation and code changes to evade detection. Again, no steganography mentioned.

Collection involves stealing data from browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and their autocomplete, cookies, passwords, etc. It also evolved to steal from Firefox, including logins, certificates, and form history. So it's collecting a lot of data but not specifying how that data is transmitted.

Exfiltration: The stolen info goes to a configured C2 server, which is different from the loader's C2. The admin panel was active at the time of the report. So the data is sent to another server, but the method isn't specified beyond that.

Now, the question is whether steganography is used for C2, sending data, and version upgrades. The CTI outline doesn't mention steganography at all. It talks about using base64 encoding for some parts, but that's a different method. Steganography is about hiding data within other data, like images or files, which isn't mentioned here.

The infostealer uses PowerShell and .NET, and the persistence method is via LNK files. There's no indication that they're using steganography for communication. The focus seems to be on evading detection through obfuscation and persistence mechanisms rather than hiding data within other files or media.

So, based on the outline, there's no mention of steganography being used. Therefore, the answer is likely "No."
</think>

The CTI outline does not mention the use of steganography by the Jupyter infostealer. It details the use of base64 encoding, PowerShell, and persistence methods but not steganography. Therefore, the infostealer does not use steganography for C2 communications or data transmission.

Final Answer: B: No
