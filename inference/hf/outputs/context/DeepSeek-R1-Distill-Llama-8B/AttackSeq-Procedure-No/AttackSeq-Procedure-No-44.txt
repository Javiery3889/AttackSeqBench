Okay, so I need to figure out whether Machete would split files into smaller parts if they're 1,000,000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, I remember that Machete is a malware used in the Machete campaign. The outline describes several stages: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Collection, and Command and Control.

Looking at the Collection section, it says Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder. It also mentions that files and logs are encrypted. So, the malware encrypts the data before moving it.

Now, the question is about whether Machete divides files into smaller parts if they're over 1,000,000 bytes. I know that when exfiltrating large files, especially over networks, it's common to split them into smaller chunks to avoid detection and to fit within the size limits of the communication channels, like email attachments or C&C protocols.

Machete uses FTP and HTTP for C&C, so it's possible that it needs to handle large files. Since the malware encrypts the data, splitting might be necessary to manage the size. The CTI doesn't explicitly mention splitting, but given common practices, it's likely that the malware would split large files to avoid issues with size limits or detection.

So, the answer should be yes, Machete would split the files if they're too large.

The CTI outline indicates that Machete encrypts data and uses FTP and HTTP for exfiltration. Given that large files may exceed transmission limits, splitting them is a common practice to avoid detection and ensure successful exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
