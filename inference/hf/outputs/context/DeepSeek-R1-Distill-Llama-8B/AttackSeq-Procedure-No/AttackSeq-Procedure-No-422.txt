Okay, so I need to figure out whether the observed campaign will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The campaign uses phishing emails with malicious Word documents that have embedded macros. When the macro is opened, it triggers a VBS script that executes a PowerShell payload. This script then downloads and runs Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

The attack sequence starts with reconnaissance via phishing, then execution through macros and PowerShell, followed by defense evasion using in-memory operations and a specific DCOM object. The C2 communication is done via PowerShell using DownloadString and DownloadData methods. The impact is the deployment of ransomware and malware, which includes credential harvesting and data exfiltration.

Now, the question is about exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS. I remember that CVE-2018-13379 is a vulnerability in FortiOS related to the management interface. It allows unauthenticated access to the FortiOS API, which can be exploited to perform commands as the root user. This is a significant vulnerability because it can lead to full control over the device.

Looking at the attack sequence, the campaign uses phishing to get initial access, then uses PowerShell for execution. The TTPs mentioned are about how the malware is delivered and executed, but I don't see any direct mention of exploiting FortiOS vulnerabilities. The focus is more on delivering malware through documents and using PowerShell for C2.

The question is whether the campaign will exploit this specific CVE after initial access. Since the initial access is via phishing emails and the subsequent steps involve using macros and PowerShell, there's no indication that the attackers are using any FortiOS exploit. The CTI outline doesn't mention any network-level exploitation tools or techniques that would target FortiOS. Therefore, it's unlikely that this campaign is exploiting CVE-2018-13379 in this context.

So, the answer should be "No" because the attack doesn't involve exploiting FortiOS vulnerabilities as part of its TTPs.
</think>

The campaign described in the CTI outline focuses on delivering malware via phishing emails and using PowerShell for execution, without mentioning any exploitation of FortiOS vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379. Therefore, it's unlikely the campaign exploits this CVE.

Final Answer: B: No
