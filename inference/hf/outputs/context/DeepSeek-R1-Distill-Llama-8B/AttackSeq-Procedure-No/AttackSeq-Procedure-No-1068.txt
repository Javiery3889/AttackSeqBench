Okay, so I need to figure out whether Yellow Garuda's Telegram 'grabber' tool divides the collected data into fixed-size chunks to evade detection. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the CTI outline says that Yellow Garuda uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool to collect data. The tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. It also mentions that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and in JSON format. 

Now, the question is about whether this data is divided into fixed-size chunks to evade detection. I remember that fixed-size chunking is a common technique used by threat actors to make data exfiltration less noticeable. By breaking data into small, predictable chunks, it's harder for security tools to detect the transfer of each piece, as each chunk might not be immediately suspicious on its own.

Looking at the CTI outline, it doesn't explicitly state that Yellow Garuda uses chunking. However, the mention of storing data in SQLite and JSON suggests structured data handling, which could imply some form of chunking. Also, the focus on evading detection might point towards using techniques like chunking to avoid detection.

Since the outline doesn't provide explicit information about chunking, but the context of data exfiltration and evasion suggests that it's a likely technique, I think the answer is yes.
</think>

The CTI outline indicates that Yellow Garuda's 'grabber' tool collects data and stores it in SQLite and JSON formats. Given the context of data exfiltration and OPSEC mistakes, it's plausible that the tool uses fixed-size chunks to evade detection, as this is a common technique for data exfiltration.

Final Answer: A: Yes
