Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether recipients who receive a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report are likely to get spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery after getting infected with QuasarRAT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It talks about an attack by the Patchwork APT group, also known as Dropping Elephant. They started their activities in March and April 2018. They're targeting US-based think tanks with spear phishing campaigns. The emails they send have domains and themes mimicking well-known organizations like CFR, CSIS, and MERICS. The malicious documents are RTF files that exploit CVE-2017-8750, which is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office related to the OLE2 format. These RTF files drop a payload called QuasarRAT, which is a remote access Trojan. Once QuasarRAT is dropped, it creates a scheduled task to execute itself every 5 minutes for up to 60 days. The malware also uses a DLL signed by AirVPN to create this scheduled task, ensuring persistence across reboots.

So, the attack sequence goes like this: they do reconnaissance, send spear phishing emails with malicious RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750, which then drop QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is then used for persistence and command and control, beacons to a domain called tautiaos.com.

Now, the question is asking if recipients who get a document that's a legitimate blog post or report are likely to receive more spear phishing emails with RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 after getting infected with QuasarRAT. The options are Yes or No.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. It says "after getting infected with QuasarRAT." But QuasarRAT is the payload that's delivered by the RTF document. So, if someone gets infected with QuasarRAT, does that mean they'll get more spear phishing emails? Or is it the other way around?

Looking back at the CTI outline, the initial step is the spear phishing emails with RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750, which deliver QuasarRAT. So the infection happens when the RTF document is opened, which then drops QuasarRAT. Once QuasarRAT is on the system, it creates a scheduled task to run itself every 5 minutes, which would allow it to persist and maybe do other things, like beaconing to the C2 server.

But the question is about whether after getting infected with QuasarRAT, they'll receive more spear phishing emails. From the outline, the initial infection is via the RTF document. Once QuasarRAT is installed, does it cause the system to send out more phishing emails? Or does it receive more?

Wait, the question is phrased as "after getting infected with QuasarRAT," so the infection has already happened. So, after the system is infected, would the user receive more spear phishing emails? Or is the question about whether the initial infection leads to more phishing emails?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "is it likely that they will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT?"

So, the scenario is that they receive a document simulating a legitimate report. Then, after getting infected with QuasarRAT, will they get more spear phishing emails with RTF docs exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery.

Wait, but QuasarRAT is the payload delivered by the RTF document. So the initial infection is via the RTF document. Once QuasarRAT is on the system, does it cause the system to send out more phishing emails? Or does it receive more?

From the CTI outline, the threat actors are sending the RTF documents as part of the spear phishing campaign. So the initial infection is the RTF document leading to QuasarRAT. Once QuasarRAT is installed, it's used for persistence and command and control. It doesn't mention that QuasarRAT itself sends out more phishing emails. The question is about whether after getting infected with QuasarRAT, they'll receive more spear phishing emails with RTF docs.

But the CTI outline doesn't mention that QuasarRAT sends out more phishing emails. It just says that the initial emails are part of the spear phishing campaign that delivered QuasarRAT. So, the initial infection is via the RTF document, which then installs QuasarRAT. There's no indication that QuasarRAT itself causes the system to send out more phishing emails. Therefore, after being infected with QuasarRAT, the system wouldn't receive more RTF documents via email; instead, the initial infection was the RTF document leading to QuasarRAT.

So, the answer would be No, because the initial infection is the RTF document, and QuasarRAT doesn't cause more RTF documents to be sent via email. Therefore, the recipients wouldn't receive more RTF documents after being infected with QuasarRAT.
</think>

The analysis indicates that the initial infection occurs when the RTF document is opened, leading to the installation of QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is used for persistence and command and control but does not itself send out more RTF documents via email. Therefore, after infection with QuasarRAT, recipients are unlikely to receive additional RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.

Final Answer: B: No
