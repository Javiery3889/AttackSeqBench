Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames after using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It describes the attack sequence of CosmicDuke, which is a malware. The outline is divided into several sections: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Collection, Command and Control, and Exfiltration.

Looking at the Initial Access, CosmicDuke uses social engineering to trick users into opening a PDF with a malicious Flash exploit. That's the first step in the attack.

Next, during Execution, the malware uses a loader to run malicious code. The loader is associated with MiniDuke, which was first seen in 2011 and updated in 2014. So, the execution phase is about running the malware on the victim's system.

Moving on to Persistence, the outline mentions that CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installs a service called 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.' This service helps the malware maintain persistence by duplicating tokens and running the malware when explorer.exe is accessed. So, after initial execution, the malware ensures it stays on the system.

Credential Access comes next. CosmicDuke targets various applications like Skype, email clients, and Windows systems to steal credentials. This phase is about gathering credentials, which are then used for further access.

Then, in the Collection phase, the malware uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It also searches removable drives for specific file types and avoids drives named 'trandescend.' So, after gaining access and persistence, it starts collecting data from the system.

Command and Control involves sending data to remote servers via HTTP, FTP, or WebDav. The configuration is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed. Finally, Exfiltration is the process of sending the collected data to the servers.

Now, the question is about whether CosmicDuke will search for files and target non-English filenames after using the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. The options are Yes or No.

From the outline, the Collection phase includes using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. These tools collect information, which would involve searching the system for data. However, the outline doesn't explicitly mention searching for non-English filenames. It does mention searching removable drives for certain file types and avoiding specific drives, but not specifically about non-English filenames.

The question is whether this file searching includes targeting non-English filenames. Since the Collection phase is about gathering data, it's possible that the keylogger might capture any text, including filenames, but the outline doesn't specify targeting non-English ones. The focus seems to be on exfiltration of collected data, which would include whatever the keylogger captures, regardless of language.

Therefore, based on the outline, there's no indication that CosmicDuke specifically targets non-English filenames. The collection tools might collect all types of filenames, but the targeting isn't mentioned as a specific action. So, the answer would be No.

The CTI outline indicates that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer during the Collection phase, which involves gathering information from the system. However, it does not specify that the malware targets non-English filenames. The focus is on exfiltration of collected data, not specifically targeting non-English filenames. Therefore, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke targets non-English filenames after using these tools.

Final Answer: B: No
