Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant communicated with its C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication after performing initial reconnaissance. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The Rising Sun implant is part of the Operation Sharpshooter campaign. The initial access involved distributing malicious documents with a macro that injected a downloader into the memory of Word. The macro then executed a second-stage implant called Rising Sun.

In the Execution phase, the shellcode used functions like LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress to download the Rising Sun payload and a decoy document. It then executed these payloads using CreateProcessA and ShellExecuteA. So, the Rising Sun implant was deployed and started running on the target systems.

Moving on to the Discovery phase, the Rising Sun implant did several things: it gathered network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address, system info, and OS product name from the registry. It also decrypted additional info, though not all was used. Now, the question is about how it communicated with its C2 server after this initial phase.

The question is specifically about whether it used blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication. I know that in the Execution phase, the Rising Sun implant was using HTTP POST requests to exfiltrate data. The exfiltration method used RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding, which are common in some cyber espionage campaigns, especially those attributed to groups like Lazarus Group.

Looking at the Others section, it mentions that Rising Sun shares similarities with Duuzer, a backdoor from 2015, and that it's linked to the Lazarus Group but with possible false flags. Lazarus Group is known for using various communication methods, including using legitimate services for C2, such as blogs and forums, to avoid detection.

So, during the initial reconnaissance, Rising Sun collected info and then exfiltrated it via HTTP. But the question is about communication after that. Since Lazarus often uses multiple methods, including blogs and WordPress, it's plausible that Rising Sun would too, especially if it's linked to them. However, the initial communication after reconnaissance might not necessarily be via blogs and WordPress. The exfiltration was via HTTP, but maybe the C2 communication is through other means.

Wait, the question is about whether it communicated using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional. The Rising Sun's exfiltration was via HTTP, but the initial communication after reconnaissance might have been through other channels. Since the question is about after the initial reconnaissance, maybe the Rising Sun uses blogs and WordPress for C2 communication, especially if it's linked to Lazarus, which does that.

But I'm a bit confused. The Rising Sun's exfiltration was via HTTP, but the question is about communication after initial reconnaissance. Maybe the Rising Sun uses blogs and WordPress for command and control, which would make sense if it's part of a group that does that. So, the answer would be yes, it's likely.

The Rising Sun implant, linked to the Lazarus Group, is known to use various communication methods, including blogs and WordPress, for command and control. After initial reconnaissance, it's plausible that it communicates bidirectionally through these platforms.

Final Answer: A: Yes
