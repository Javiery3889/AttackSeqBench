Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails using a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that Hidden Cobra, also known as the Bankshot malware group, is targeting cryptocurrency and financial organizations, specifically in the Turkish financial system. The attack uses a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, CVE-2018-4878. This exploit allows arbitrary code execution, which leads to the implant being installed.

The initial access method is via spear phishing emails, which is a common tactic in cyberattacks. The document is named Agreement.docx and is designed to look like a legitimate agreement, which is a classic social engineering technique to trick victims into opening the document.

Looking at the execution phase, the implant is a DLL that's downloaded from a specific URL, falcancoin.io. The persistence mechanism is in place to ensure the malware remains on the system for further exploitation. The defense evasion part shows that the malware is designed to avoid detection and erase files, which makes it harder to detect and remove.

The command and control (C2) servers are hardcoded in the implant, two of which are Chinese-language online gambling sites. This suggests that the attackers have a global reach, not just limited to one region.

The 'Others' section mentions that the exploit has evaded static defenses and remains undetected on VirusTotal. It's the first time Bankshot has been linked to financial-related attacks since 2017, indicating a shift in their targeting.

Now, the question is whether Hidden Cobra will use the same tactics again. The question specifically mentions the use of Bankshot implants for full control and file wiping, which aligns with the initial attack described. The TTPs involved are:
1. Spear phishing via email with a malicious document.
2. Exploit using CVE-2018-4878.
3. Implanting malware (Bankshot) for persistence and control.
4. Use of C2 servers for communication.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Based on the CTI outline, all the necessary steps are present in the attack, including the use of the same exploit and the same method of delivery. There's no indication that they've changed their tactics, especially since the exploit is still effective and the group has a history of using similar methods. Therefore, it's highly likely they will continue this approach.

The analysis indicates that Hidden Cobra has repeatedly used spear phishing emails with the same exploit and implant in the past, targeting financial sectors. The current attack aligns with their historical methods, making it likely they will target Turkish financial organizations similarly.

Final Answer: A: Yes
