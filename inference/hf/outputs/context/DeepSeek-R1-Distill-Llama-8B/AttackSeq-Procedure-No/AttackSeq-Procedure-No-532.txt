Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor would steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies after evading defenses by using encoded blobs in PowerShell. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that Dropping Elephant is a threat actor, also known as Chinastrats and Patchwork. They target high-profile entities, especially those involved in diplomacy and economics, which are probably handling sensitive information. Their initial method is spear-phishing, which is a common tactic to trick people into opening malicious documents. The initial attack uses documents that send a 'ping' to their server when opened, so that's the first step.

Then, they send a second spear-phishing email with either an MS Word document exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or a PowerPoint document exploiting CVE-2014-6352. These exploits are known vulnerabilities that can be used to drop malware. After that, they use watering hole attacks, which involve compromising a legitimate website to infect users who visit it, making it look like a trusted source.

Once they have access, the backdoor they use is UPX packed, which means it's compressed and can be hard to detect. This backdoor then downloads more malware from their C2 server. The key part here is that they use encoded blobs that are decoded into PowerShell command line scripts. This method helps them evade detection because the scripts aren't immediately obvious as malicious.

Looking at the defense evasion part, they use these encoded blobs to download additional malware, which helps them avoid being caught by traditional antivirus tools. So, after evading detection, the backdoor is active.

Now, the question is about whether this backdoor would steal browser cookies from Google Chrome and Apple Safari. From the CTI outline, the collection phase is mentioned, where a file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions like .doc, .docx, etc., and uploads them to the C2 server. This suggests that the group is interested in stealing various file types, possibly looking for sensitive information within those files.

However, the question specifically mentions stealing browser cookies. Browser cookies are stored in specific files, usually in the user profile directory. For example, Chrome cookies are stored in a file like Chrome's cookie.txt or similar, while Safari might store them in a different location. If the file-stealer module is looking for common document types, it might not specifically target these cookie files unless the extension matches.

Wait, but the CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention stealing browser cookies. It only talks about collecting files with specific extensions. So, the file-stealer module is collecting various document types, but does that include the specific files where browser cookies are stored? I'm not sure. The outline doesn't specify that, so maybe it's not part of the initial collection phase.

Alternatively, maybe the backdoor, after evading detection, could be used to execute commands that specifically target browser cookies. For example, the backdoor could be used to run a script that enumerates browser cookies and exfiltrates them. But the CTI outline doesn't mention this. It only says that the backdoor pings the C2 server and that the file-stealer collects certain files.

So, based on the information given, the CTI outline doesn't explicitly state that browser cookies are being stolen. The file-stealer module is collecting various document types, but unless specified, we can't assume it's targeting browser cookies. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not likely to steal those cookies.
</think>

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention that the Dropping Elephant group steals browser cookies. The file-stealer module collects files with specific document extensions, but there's no indication it targets browser cookie files. Therefore, it's unlikely the backdoor would steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari cookies.

Final Answer: B: No
