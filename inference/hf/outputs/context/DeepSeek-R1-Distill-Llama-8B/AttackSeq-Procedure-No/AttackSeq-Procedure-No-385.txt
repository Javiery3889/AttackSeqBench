Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain admin credentials and stole a VPN certificate after deploying backdoors. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the outline mentions that APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI is special because it bypasses command prompt policies by patching cmd.exe. RoyalDNS works through DNS to execute commands and is persistent.

Looking at the Persistence section, RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the network, which means it's likely used for ongoing access. 

Next, Privilege Escalation: APT15 used Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials. Mimikatz is a tool that can dump credentials, so that makes sense here. This would allow them to move laterally within the network.

Credential Access: The outline says they used Mimikatz to obtain domain admin credentials and stole a VPN certificate. So yes, they did use Mimikatz for this part.

The question is asking if, after deploying the backdoors, they used Mimikatz for credentials and stole a VPN. The outline clearly states both actions, so the answer should be yes.
</think>

The CTI outline explicitly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain admin credentials and stole a VPN certificate. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
