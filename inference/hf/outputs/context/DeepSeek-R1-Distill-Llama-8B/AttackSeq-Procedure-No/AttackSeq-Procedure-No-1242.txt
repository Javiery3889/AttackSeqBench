Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether APT28 will divide files if their size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, I know that APT28 uses a module called pr.dll to upload stolen data to their C&C server. The question is about whether they divide the files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more. 

Looking at the CTI outline, under the Collection section, it says that pr.dll is used to upload data. It also mentions that pr.dll is crafted individually for each target and can have different plugins for data collection. So, it seems like pr.dll is designed to handle various data sizes.

I don't see any specific mention of file size limits in the outline. It talks about data collection, but not about splitting files based on size. The focus is more on uploading data through pr.dll, which is a module designed for that purpose. Since there's no indication that APT28 has a size limit, I think they would handle large files as a single unit. Therefore, they probably don't divide the files based on size.

The CTI outline indicates that APT28 uses pr.dll to upload data without mentioning any size restrictions. Since pr.dll is designed for individualized data collection, it likely handles large files without splitting them. Thus, APT28 is unlikely to divide files based on size.

Final Answer: B: No
