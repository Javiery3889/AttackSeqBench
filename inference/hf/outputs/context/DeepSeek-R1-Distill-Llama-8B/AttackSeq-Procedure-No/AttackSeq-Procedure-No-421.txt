Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through the phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. The options are A: Yes or B: No.

First, I need to go back to the CTI outline provided. Let me read through it carefully.

The outline mentions that the campaign uses phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. These macros, when opened, execute a VBS script that calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script then downloads and executes payloads for both Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

So, the initial access is through the phishing email, which is the entry point. The user opens the document, which triggers the macro execution. The macro then runs a VBS script that leads to the download and execution of malicious payloads.

The question is specifically asking if the campaign will execute the VBS macros only before gaining initial access through the phishing emails. So, does the VBS macro execution happen only after the initial phishing email is received and the document is opened?

From the outline, the process starts with the phishing email, which is the initial access vector. The user opens the document, which triggers the macro. The macro then does the rest, including downloading and executing the malicious scripts. There's no mention of any other initial access method before the phishing email. The Others section also talks about analysis using VirusTotal Graph and mentions that the campaign was analyzed to combat it, but that doesn't add anything about alternative initial access methods.

So, the VBS macros are executed as part of the initial phishing email's document. Therefore, the answer should be Yes, the macros execute only before initial access through the phishing emails.
</think>

The campaign begins with a phishing email that contains a malicious Word document. Upon opening the document, the embedded macro executes, triggering the download and execution of malicious payloads. There's no indication of alternative initial access methods, so the VBS macros execute only after the phishing email.

Final Answer: A: Yes
