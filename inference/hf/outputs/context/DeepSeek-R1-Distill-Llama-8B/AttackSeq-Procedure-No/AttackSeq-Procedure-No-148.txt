Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021 established command and control using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point after accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. The outline describes a cyber attack that TG1021 carried out, using various MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each part to see what each phase entails.

Starting with Reconnaissance, TG1021 used tools like TG1021, which exploited IIS servers. Then, Initial Access was through deserialization attacks on these servers. Execution involved a memory-resident malware, NodeIISWeb, which is in-memory. For Persistence, they used web shells and a custom framework, but they stopped using disk-resident tools to maintain stealth.

Privilege Escalation involved using tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for escalation. Defense Evasion included interfering with logging and evading EDRs. Credential Access involved modifying webpages to save credentials. Discovery used tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit. Lateral Movement involved using SMB to access shared folders and drop web shells on additional servers.

Now, the question is about whether after using SMB to access shared folders and dropping NodeIISWeb, TG1021 established command and control via GitLab and Digital Point using a one-way method.

Looking at the CTI outline, under Lateral Movement, TG1021 used SMB to access internal web servers and dropped NodeIISWeb via SMB. The outline doesn't mention anything about command and control (C2) communication methods like GitLab or Digital Point. It does mention that the malware operates in-memory, which suggests it's trying to avoid persistence but not necessarily setting up a C2 infrastructure.

The question is specifically about whether they used a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point. Since the CTI outline doesn't mention GitLab or Digital Point, I can infer that these aren't part of the attack described. The focus is on initial access, execution, persistence through web shells, privilege escalation, and lateral movement via SMB.

Therefore, the answer should be that they didn't establish command and control using those methods because there's no mention of it in the CTI outline. So the correct answer is No.

The CTI outline does not mention GitLab or Digital Point as part of the attack, focusing instead on initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, and lateral movement via SMB. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
