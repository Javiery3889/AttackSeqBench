Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in the Charming Kitten campaign used images instead of text in their phishing emails after verifying victims' credentials and prompting for a 2-step verification code. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that the attackers used phishing emails with fake security alerts from domains like notifications.mailservices@gmail.com and noreply.customermails@gmail.com. They also created fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials. So, the initial phase involved credential verification through these phishing emails.

Next, the outline talks about their defense evasion tactics. It says the attackers used images instead of text in their phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems. They also used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images. Additionally, a hidden tracking image was used in emails to monitor when targets opened them.

So, the key point here is that they used images in their phishing emails to evade detection. This was part of their defense evasion phase, which happened after the initial access phase where they verified credentials.

The question is asking if, after verifying credentials and prompting for a 2-step verification code, the attackers would then switch to using images instead of text in their phishing emails. Based on the outline, the use of images was part of their initial phishing emails to bypass security systems. It doesn't explicitly mention using images after the 2-step verification step, but the defense evasion tactics were part of their overall approach, which included using images in the emails.

Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the attackers would continue using images in their phishing emails as part of their evasion tactics, even after the initial credential verification. So, the answer should be yes, they would use images instead of text in the emails to evade detection.

The attackers used images in their phishing emails to bypass security systems, which was part of their defense evasion tactics. This method was employed during the initial phase, including after credential verification, as part of their overall strategy to avoid detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
