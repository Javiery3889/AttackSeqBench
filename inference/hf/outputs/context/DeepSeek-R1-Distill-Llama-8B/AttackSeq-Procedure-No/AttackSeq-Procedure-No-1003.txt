Okay, so I need to figure out whether Longhorn's malware configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that Longhorn has been active since 2011, using backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities. They were first noticed by Symantec in 2014 using a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware. So, they have a history of using sophisticated methods.

Moving on to the Defense Evasion section, it says they follow Vault 7 guidelines. They use practices like wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, unique deployment-time keys for obfuscation, and secure erase protocols with renaming and overwriting. They also communicate externally at select times with upload limits and random intervals to avoid detection. This tells me they are careful about their communication to stay under the radar.

In the Discovery section, their malware is built for espionage with system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. They use operational security measures to remain undetected. So, they're focused on espionage, which implies they need secure and stealthy communication.

Looking at the Collection section, the malware has remote control capabilities and can be customized with plugins. It's designed for espionage, with system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration. This reinforces that they need reliable and secure command and control (C&C) communication.

Now, the Command and Control part is crucial. It states that Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address per target for their C&C servers. They use privacy services to hide the real identity of these servers. The communication is over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect it from identification. This directly answers the question about the configuration for C&C.

The Others section adds that Symantec has been tracking them for three years, they've infected many targets globally, and they operate with high operational security, possibly from a specific region and during standard working hours. This context supports their methodical approach, including secure communication.

The question asks if, after scheduled exfiltration with upload limits and random intervals, Longhorn's malware configures a specific domain and IP per target for C&C over HTTPS with a custom protocol. From the CTI outline, the answer is clearly yes. They do this to avoid detection and maintain security.
</think>

The CTI outline explicitly states that Longhorn's malware configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol. This is part of their operational security measures to stay undetected and secure their communications.

Final Answer: A: Yes
