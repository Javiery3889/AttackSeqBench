Okay, so I need to figure out whether the malware from the FHAPPI campaign installs itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of PowerShell. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the attack starts with a phishing email that contains a link to a Geocities website hosting VBScript malware. When the VBScript is executed, it downloads a .doc file, which then triggers a PowerShell attack that infects the system with Poison Ivy malware.

Looking at the Command and Control section, the malware communicates with a C2 server at 61.97.243.15, which is a dial-up IP in South Korea. The domain used is 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to someone in China. The Others section mentions that the campaign is linked to a larger APT group and uses email addresses like 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing.

Now, the question is about whether the malware uses cron jobs or PowerShell for further execution. From the outline, the initial infection is through a VBScript that leads to a PowerShell attack. Poison Ivy is known for being a file-based malware that injects itself into processes like 'userinit.exe'. It's also mentioned that the campaign used fileless techniques, which suggests they avoid using traditional file signatures, possibly relying on PowerShell for persistence.

Cron jobs are typically used for scheduling tasks, often on Unix-based systems, using a crontab file. However, the CTI outline doesn't mention anything about cron jobs or crontab usage. Instead, it focuses on the use of PowerShell for execution and the fact that the campaign used fileless techniques to avoid detection.

So, the malware likely continues using PowerShell for persistence or further actions rather than switching to cron. Therefore, the answer is No, it's not likely to use cron.

The FHAPPI campaign uses a VBScript that triggers a PowerShell attack to infect the system with Poison Ivy. The CTI outline doesn't mention cron jobs, focusing on fileless techniques and PowerShell. Thus, it's unlikely the malware uses cron.

Final Answer: B: No
