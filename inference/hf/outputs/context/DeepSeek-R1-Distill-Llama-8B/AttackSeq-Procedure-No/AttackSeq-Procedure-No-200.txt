Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy after compromising a computer with GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that GreyEnergy uses two main initial infection vectors: compromising a public-facing web service and spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. The malicious documents drop "GreyEnergy mini," which is a lightweight backdoor that doesn't require admin privileges. Once they get a foothold, they use Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, which then grants them domain admin privileges.

Now, the question is about whether they use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and other tools across the network. I'm not entirely sure what PDQ Deploy is, but I think it's related to software deployment. Maybe it's a tool used to distribute malicious software or tools across a network.

Looking at the attack sequence, after compromising a computer and using Nmap and Mimikatz, the attackers would likely escalate their privileges. With admin access, they can install more tools or deploy malicious software. PDQ Deploy is a known tool for deploying software, so it's plausible they'd use it to spread tools like AvosLocker, which is a ransomware.

I don't see any information in the CTI outline that directly mentions PDQ Deploy, but the context suggests they use standard tools for their tasks. Since PDQ Deploy is a common tool for such operations, it's a likely candidate. The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Given the context, I think the answer is A: Yes.

The GreyEnergy group, after compromising a computer and using Nmap and Mimikatz to gather credentials, would likely use PDQ Deploy to distribute tools like AvosLocker across the network. This aligns with their use of standard tools for their operations.

Final Answer: A
