Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the adversary in this CTI outline would use custom-built malware to exfiltrate data to cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive before collecting data from Microsoft SharePoint Online. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The attack starts with initial access using credentials from previous breaches, then moves to credential stuffing or password spraying. They use Cobalt Strike, which is a framework for penetration testing, but it's being used maliciously here. They install it via PowerShell one-liners and use scheduled tasks to execute batch files.

Looking at the persistence part, they don't use persistence mechanisms on the compromised system, but they do install Cobalt Strike on high-uptime systems like servers. They also look for VPN and firewall configs as backup access. So, they're trying to maintain access but aren't relying on persistence on all systems.

For privilege escalation, they use password spraying against domain admin accounts and use tools like ntdsAudit and msadcs.exe to dump password hashes. They also try to clean up their traces, using Timestomp to remove logs and files, which suggests they're cautious about detection.

Credential access is mainly through brute force and credential stuffing, with a lot of login attempts from a small set of IPs. They use tools like PsLogList to check for active privileged users and then use Mimikatz from Cobalt Strike to dump credentials.

In lateral movement, they move to domain controllers quickly and use methods like SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM. They continue moving to find data of interest, like PII or files on web or file servers.

Collection involves exfiltration preparation. They collect data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, and copy files from local and remote systems. They also collect email data. The question is about whether they use custom malware to exfiltrate to cloud services before collecting from SharePoint.

The question is about whether they use custom malware to exfiltrate to cloud services before collecting from SharePoint. The CTI outline mentions they use Cobalt Strike for C2, which in earlier years used DNS for C2, then switched to HTTPS. They also used a cracked trial version, which might limit functionality.

I don't see any mention of custom malware in the CTI outline. They rely heavily on Cobalt Strike, which is a framework, not custom malware. They use it for command and control, but not for exfiltration of large data chunks. The collection phase involves copying data from various sources, including SharePoint, but the method isn't specified beyond that.

So, the question is whether they use custom malware for exfiltration. Since the CTI doesn't mention any custom tools for this, it's more likely they use existing tools or methods they have, like Cobalt Strike or other existing exfiltration tools, rather than building their own malware. Therefore, the answer would be No.

The CTI outline does not mention the use of custom-built malware for exfiltration. The adversary primarily uses Cobalt Strike, a framework, for command and control, and there's no indication they develop their own tools for this purpose. They focus on credential-based access and data collection through existing methods, so the answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
