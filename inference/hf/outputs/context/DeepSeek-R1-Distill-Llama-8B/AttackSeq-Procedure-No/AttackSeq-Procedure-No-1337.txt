Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware will use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion after connecting back to the exploit domain. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The attack started with an initial access phase where Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119). They embedded this exploit on a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) website. This was done to target visitors interested in a specific legal case between the Philippines and China.

Next, the execution phase involved the malware payload, which was named Rdws.exe. This executable used a DLL sideloading technique. It deployed its main component via this method. The malicious DLL, dbghelp.dll, was loaded using the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe). This DLL then loaded a backdoor binary blob, ticrf.rat.

Looking at the defense evasion part, the attackers used the same sideloading technique to evade defenses. They deployed a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable. This suggests that sideloading was a key part of their tactics to avoid detection.

Now, the question is about whether, after connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org, the malware will use sideloading again to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

From the CTI outline, the initial access was through a Flash exploit, followed by Rdws.exe using DLL sideloading. The defense evasion also used sideloading. So, the attackers have a history of using sideloading techniques in their attack. It makes sense that they would reuse this method if they need to deploy additional malicious components or avoid detection again.

The question is specifically about whether they'll use sideloading after establishing a connection. Since they've already used it in the initial stages, it's logical that they would continue this approach. The fact that they altered the PCA webpages and used falsified domain registration also points to a methodical approach, possibly indicating they plan to maintain anonymity and evade detection, which would require techniques like sideloading.

So, putting it all together, the malware is likely to use sideloading again to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion after connecting back to their exploit domain.

The malware is likely to use sideloading techniques again, as it's a method they've already employed in the initial stages of the attack. This approach helps in evading defenses and deploying malicious components covertly.

Final Answer: A: Yes
