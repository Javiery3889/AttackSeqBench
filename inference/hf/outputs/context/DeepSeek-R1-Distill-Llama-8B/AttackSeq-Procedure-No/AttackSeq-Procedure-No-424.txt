Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about a cyber attack sequence. Let me start by reading through the CTI outline carefully.

The outline describes a cyber attack that starts with a phishing email with a malicious Word document. The document has embedded macros that, when executed, deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. The initial access is through these phishing emails, and the macro uses PowerShell scripts to do its work.

Looking at the initial access part, the macro is in a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'. It's part of a campaign that started in late 2018 and continued into early 2019. The macro uses VBS scripts, which are executed via PowerShell. The script operates in memory, so it doesn't write to the disk, making it harder to detect. It uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and a specific DCOM object to execute the files without saving them to disk.

Then, the command and control part says the PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers. It uses DownloadString to contact the first server and DownloadData to get a resource from a second server. The payloads are GandCrab and Ursnif. GandCrab is a ransomware variant that encrypts files, while Ursnif does things like credential harvesting and gathering system info.

The question is asking if, after the initial access via the phishing email, a COM object will execute queries to gather system info and download payloads for Ursnif and GandCrab. The answer choices are Yes or No.

From the outline, the macro uses a DCOM object to execute downloaded files. Since the macro is using PowerShell and a DCOM object, it's likely that this object is used to interact with the system. The script communicates with C2 servers to download the payloads, which include both Ursnif and GandCrab. So, after the initial access, the script would indeed use a COM object to gather system information and download these payloads.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The attack sequence involves using a DCOM object to execute commands after initial access, which aligns with the question's scenario. Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
