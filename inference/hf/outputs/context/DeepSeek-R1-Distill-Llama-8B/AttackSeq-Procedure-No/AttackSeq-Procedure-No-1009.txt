Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether, after enabling macros which lead to file execution in randomly named directories during the Execution phase, the campaign is likely to deliver payloads through malicious documents only after using obfuscation and publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics. 

First, I need to go back to the CTI outline provided. Let me read through it carefully.

In the Initial Access section, it mentions that the campaign uses malicious documents with text and file names in Tajik language, targeting specific organizations. These documents use social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros and activating the payload. Some payloads are embedded directly, while others are downloaded after the lure is clicked. There's also a separate lure with a program key generator written in Java that's bundled with a Java downloader. The payload is the same in both cases.

Moving on to Execution: After enabling macros, two files are created in the ProgramData directory in randomly named directories. One is a VBS script that executes a PowerShell script. The VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler for persistence. In other campaigns, two files are dropped: a VBS script and a base64 encoded text file, which decodes into a PowerShell file. The latest change drops three files: an .sct scriptlet, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file. The scriptlet and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker. The PowerShell script has multiple layers of obfuscation and is split into three parts: global variables, functions for encryption, and a backdoor function that collects info and sends it to C&C.

In the Persistence section, the VBS script's path is added to the task scheduler.

Discovery and Collection are the same: the backdoor collects info and sends it to C&C.

Command and Control uses XML messages with specific commands and uses RSA encryption with small keys. The attackers monitor incoming connections and have a personalized message when an improper request is made. There's also a hidden message in the script in Chinese, possibly a false flag.

Now, the question is about whether, after macros are enabled and files are executed, the campaign delivers payloads through malicious documents only after using obfuscation and publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of Defense Evasion.

Looking at the Execution phase, the scriptlet and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker. So, the campaign is using these tools for defense evasion. The question is whether this happens only after delivering payloads through malicious documents.

In the Initial Access, the malicious documents are used to deliver the payload, either embedded or downloaded. Then, during Execution, they use these bypassing tools. So, the obfuscation and bypassing are part of the Execution phase, not just after delivering the payload.

Wait, but the question is phrased as whether the payloads are delivered through malicious documents only after using these tactics. So, the initial delivery is through documents, and then during execution, they use these tactics. So, the answer would be yes, because the obfuscation and bypassing are part of the process after the initial document delivery.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking if the delivery is done only after using these tactics, implying that without them, the payload wouldn't be delivered. But in this case, the payload is delivered via the document, and then during execution, they use these tactics. So, the delivery happens before the obfuscation and bypassing.

Wait, but the question is about whether the payloads are delivered through malicious documents only after using these tactics. So, the initial delivery is through the document, and then during execution, they use the bypassing tools. So, the answer would be yes, because the delivery happens first, and then they use these tactics as part of the process.

Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that the delivery is done only after the obfuscation and bypassing, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The initial delivery is through the document, and the obfuscation is part of the execution phase.

So, the answer is yes, the payloads are delivered through malicious documents, and then during execution, they use these tactics. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes.
</think>

The campaign delivers payloads via malicious documents during Initial Access. During Execution, it employs obfuscation and bypassing tools as part of Defense Evasion tactics. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A
