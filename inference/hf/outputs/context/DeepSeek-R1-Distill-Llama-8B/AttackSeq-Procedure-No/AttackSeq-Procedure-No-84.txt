Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Vyveva, the Lazarus backdoor, divides files into smaller chunks if they're 1,000,000 bytes or more before exfiltrating them. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. Under the Collection tactic, it says that Vyveva can compress files with zlib before sending them to C&C. So, compression is part of the process. Now, the question is about whether it divides the files if they're 1MB or more. 

I know that using zlib for compression can handle large files, but I'm not sure if it splits them. Typically, when you compress a large file, the tool might split it into smaller parts to make transmission easier, especially over networks. But does zlib do that automatically? Or does it just compress the entire file as one?

Looking at the CTI outline again, it mentions that Vyveva compresses files with zlib for collection. It doesn't explicitly state that it splits the files. So, maybe it just compresses the entire file without splitting. However, in real-world scenarios, large files are often split into chunks to avoid issues with size limits or network bandwidth. But since the outline doesn't mention splitting, I shouldn't assume that.

Wait, but the question is specifically about whether it divides the files if they're 1MB or more. Since 1MB isn't that large in today's standards, maybe it's not a big issue. Also, the CTI doesn't mention splitting, so it's safer to say that it doesn't divide the files. Therefore, the answer is likely "No."
</think>

The CTI outline specifies that Vyveva uses zlib for compression without mentioning file splitting. Therefore, it's unlikely that Vyveva divides files into smaller chunks based on size.

Final Answer: B: No
