Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers in this campaign disabled driver signing verification by tampering with registry keys before loading a rootkit driver. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the Initial Access part says that the campaign uses malicious documents with macros to trick victims into enabling them. The payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded after a click. The malicious code then creates files in random directories and uses a VBS script to execute a PowerShell script. The payload is a .sct scriptlet, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded file. The .sct and .inf use publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.

In the Execution phase, after enabling macros, the payload runs and creates these files. The .VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence. The payload is a PowerShell script that's obfuscated and has three parts: global variables, encryption functions, and a backdoor. The backdoor collects info, takes screenshots, and sends data to C&C via XML with commands like REGISTER, IMAGE, etc. It uses small RSA keys for encryption.

Looking at the Persistence section, the VBS script is added to the task scheduler, which is a common way to ensure the malware runs on each boot. The backdoor sends info to C&C, which is encrypted.

Now, the question is about whether the attackers disabled driver signing verification by tampering with registry keys before loading a rootkit driver. The CTI mentions that the .sct and .inf files use publicly available code to bypass AppLocker. Bypassing AppLocker usually involves manipulating the registry to disable or misdirect the verification process, which is a defense evasion tactic.

So, during Execution, after the payload runs, it drops these files. The .sct and .inf are used to bypass AppLocker, which would involve modifying the registry. This suggests that the attackers are using these files to disable driver signing checks, which is a form of defense evasion. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The attackers used .sct and .inf files to bypass AppLocker, which typically involves registry modifications to disable driver signing checks. This aligns with disabling driver signing verification as a defense evasion tactic.

Final Answer: A: Yes
