Okay, so I need to figure out whether NetFlash and PyFlash will use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography after the backdoor gathers information. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that Turla uses a watering hole attack, delivering malware through a fake Adobe Flash update. The malware is NetFlash and PyFlash. The backdoor, PyFlash, is a Python-based backdoor that runs on the infected machine. It collects OS info using commands like systeminfo, tasklist, etc., and sends it to the C&C server.

The question is about whether they use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography. I remember that HTTPS is a secure protocol using TLS/SSL, which is encryption. Asymmetric Cryptography is a part of that, where the server has a public key, and the client uses that to encrypt the data, ensuring only the intended recipient can decrypt it.

Looking at the CTI outline, it mentions that the malicious code loads external JavaScript from skategirlchina[.]com. The others section also notes that Turla has been active for over a decade, with campaigns like Mosquito and LightNeuron. It says the JavaScript is similar to past campaigns but with different targets and payloads. The operation uses a known social engineering trick and has shifted payloads to evade detection.

I don't see any specific mention of HTTPS or encryption protocols in the CTI outline. It talks about the C&C protocol being used for exfiltration, but it doesn't specify the details. Since Turla is a known group, I might recall that they use certain communication methods. From what I remember, Turla, also known as the Shikiteer group, has been known to use HTTP for C&C communication, possibly without encryption, which is less secure but might be enough for their operations. They might not always use HTTPS, especially if they're trying to stay under the radar or if their C&C servers aren't set up for HTTPS.

So, putting it together, the CTI doesn't mention HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography. Without explicit info, it's safer to assume they might not use HTTPS, especially if they're using HTTP. Therefore, the answer is likely No.
</think>

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography by NetFlash or PyFlash. Turla's past behavior suggests they might use HTTP rather than HTTPS, as there's no indication of encryption protocols being employed. Therefore, it's more plausible that they do not use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography.

Final Answer: B: No
