Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Flash file 'show.swf' from the spear-phishing attack would downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload from the GIF image. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the attack sequence described in the CTI outline. The attack started with a spear-phishing email that exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash, specifically CVE-2015-5119. The exploit was hosted on domains like rpt.perrydale[.]com and report.perrydale[.]com, which resolved to a Ukrainian IP. The exploit was a Flash file named 'show.swf' which contained malicious ActionScript code.

Looking at the execution phase, the Flash exploit used several ActionScript classes: MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, and ShellWin32.as. The 'TryExpl' function in MyClass.as exploited CVE-2015-5119 by creating a use-after-free condition. Additionally, the code shared functions with a previous attack using CVE-2015-3113, which involved data type manipulation, logging, and decrypting shellcode. The shellcodes for both CVEs were 99% similar, indicating a possible connection to the APT group known as UPS or APT3.

Now, the question is whether the 'show.swf' file would downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before installing the payload from the GIF. I know that NTLM is a protocol used for authentication, and downgrading it can allow attackers to capture hashes, which can be cracked to gain access to credentials.

In the attack, the Flash exploit's ActionScript code is designed to execute shellcode for installing a payload. The 'TryExpl' function is involved in the exploit, and there's a mention of shared functions with a previous attack using CVE-2015-3113, which involved decrypting shellcode. This suggests that the attackers have the capability to handle and decrypt shellcode, possibly for various purposes, including extracting credentials.

The fact that the shellcodes for both CVEs are similar supports the idea that the same group (APT3 or UPS) is involved. APT groups often use similar techniques across their operations, so if they used a similar approach with CVE-2015-3113, it's plausible they would also use it here.

Moreover, the use of a GIF image as a payload delivery method is a common technique. The 'b.gif' is the secondary payload, which might contain malicious code or be used for further attacks. If the Flash exploit is designed to extract NTLM hashes, it's likely that it would do so before proceeding to install the payload.

Putting this together, the 'show.swf' file, by sharing code with previous attacks that involved decrypting shellcode and handling data manipulation, would probably include functionality to capture NTLM hashes. This would allow the attackers to gather credentials, which could be used for lateral movement or accessing more systems within the network.

The 'show.swf' Flash file, sharing code with previous attacks involving shellcode decryption and data manipulation, likely includes functionality to capture NTLM hashes. This would enable the attackers to gather credentials, facilitating further network access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
