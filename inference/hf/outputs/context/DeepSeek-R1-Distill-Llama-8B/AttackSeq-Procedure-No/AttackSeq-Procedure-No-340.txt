Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Nemesis bootkit, used by the FIN1 group, would evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that the Nemesis bootkit infects the Volume Boot Record (VBR). This means it modifies the system's boot process so that it loads before the operating system starts. This makes it hard to detect and remove because even if you reformat the system, the VBR is still infected. The malware is designed to be persistent, which suggests it's trying to avoid being detected.

The question is about whether the malware would place its files in directories that are typically excluded from scanning. I remember that many antivirus programs and system scans often exclude certain directories from being scanned to save resources. Commonly, these might include system directories like C:\Windows, C:\Program Files, or others where critical system files are stored. Malware might use this to their advantage by hiding in these areas.

Since the Nemesis bootkit is a bootkit, it's likely designed to be stealthy. Bootkits often go beyond just hiding files; they modify the system at a lower level. The fact that it's part of the VBR suggests it's loaded early in the boot process, which could mean it's not just hiding files but altering the system's behavior to avoid detection.

The CTI outline mentions that FIN1 has been active for several years and uses sophisticated tools like Nemesis. It also notes that other bootkits like TDL4, Necurs, and Rovnix have been used, which are known for persistence and evading detection. These bootkits are typically designed to avoid being picked up by standard antivirus tools because they operate at a lower level than the OS, making them hard to detect.

So, putting this together, if the bootkit is using the VBR, it's probably not just placing files in excluded directories but is instead modifying the system's core processes. Therefore, it's likely that the malware would evade detection not just by hiding in excluded areas but by being integrated into the boot process itself. This makes the answer more about the nature of the malware's persistence mechanism rather than just file placement.

I think the key point here is that the bootkit's persistence through the VBR makes it harder to detect, not just because it's in an excluded directory, but because it's part of the system's boot process. So the answer would be that it's likely the malware does evade detection this way.

The Nemesis bootkit's use of the VBR for persistence suggests it's designed to evade detection beyond just hiding in excluded directories. It modifies the system's boot process, making it harder to detect through traditional methods. Therefore, it's likely that the malware evades detection by being integrated into the system's core processes rather than just hiding in excluded areas.

Final Answer: A: Yes
