Okay, so I need to figure out whether the keylogger component in the VERMIN malware collects keystrokes and clipboard data before storing them encrypted in a specific folder. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, from the outline, I know that VERMIN is a RAT, so it's designed for remote access and control. It's written in .NET and uses HTTP encapsulated SOAP for C2 communication, which is a bit unusual. The malware was first identified through a sample linked to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, which might suggest a target region.

Looking at the Execution section, after initial execution, the malware checks for the system's language. If it's not Russian or Ukrainian, it tries to exit but continues due to a coding error. Then it decrypts an embedded resource using a brute force method. It sets up a scheduled task every 30 minutes to collect info like machine name, username, OS, architecture, local IP, and anti-virus software. If anti-virus is found, it doesn't install the keylogger.

So, the key point here is that the keylogger component is only installed if anti-virus isn't detected. That means if the system doesn't have antivirus, the keylogger runs. But the question is about whether it collects keystrokes and clipboard data before storing them encrypted in a specific folder.

In the Execution section, it says the keylogger is part of the malware but only gets activated if anti-virus isn't present. The Persistence section mentions that the scheduled task includes parameters like keylogger path, so it's set up to run. The Discovery section says it collects info via WMI, but I don't see explicit mention of keylogging in the initial collection.

Wait, the question is about after collecting system info, does the keylogger collect keystrokes and clipboard data. The outline says that if anti-virus is detected, the keylogger isn't installed. So, if anti-virus isn't present, the keylogger is installed. But does it collect keystrokes and clipboard data?

The outline doesn't explicitly state that the keylogger collects keystrokes. It mentions that the keylogger is a component, but the actions it performs aren't detailed beyond being part of the scheduled task. The Discovery section only talks about collecting system info via WMI. So maybe the keylogger is for keylogging, but the outline doesn't specify whether it's used after initial collection.

Wait, the question is about whether it collects keystrokes and clipboard data before storing them encrypted. The outline says the keylogger is part of the malware but doesn't specify its functionality beyond being a component. Since the keylogger isn't installed if anti-virus is present, but if it is installed, does it collect keystrokes?

I think the keylogger is meant for keylogging, but the outline doesn't explicitly say it collects clipboard data. It might only collect keystrokes. However, the question includes both keystrokes and clipboard data. The outline doesn't mention clipboard data collection, so maybe it's not part of the keylogger's functionality here.

Alternatively, maybe the keylogger does both. Since the outline doesn't specify, but the question is about whether it does, I have to infer. Since the keylogger is a component, it's likely designed for keylogging, which typically involves capturing keystrokes, but clipboard data might not be included unless specified.

Wait, the outline says the keylogger is part of the malware but doesn't mention clipboard data. So the answer is probably no, it doesn't collect clipboard data, only keystrokes. But the question includes both, so maybe the answer is no because it's only keystrokes.

Wait, the question says "keystrokes and clipboard data." The outline doesn't mention clipboard, so the answer is no. So the answer is B: No.
</think>

The VERMIN malware's keylogger component is only mentioned to be installed when anti-virus software is not detected. The outline does not specify that it collects clipboard data, only that it is a component. Therefore, the keylogger likely collects keystrokes but not clipboard data.

Final Answer: B: No
