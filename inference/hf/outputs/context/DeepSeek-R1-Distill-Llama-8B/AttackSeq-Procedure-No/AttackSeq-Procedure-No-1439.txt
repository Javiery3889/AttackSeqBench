Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the StellarParticle campaign, associated with COZY BEAR, will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after using credential hopping and configuring malware like TrailBlazer for WMI persistence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence in terms of Initial Access, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, and Lateral Movement. I need to focus on the Initial Access and Persistence sections because the question is about the sequence of TTPs used.

In the Initial Access part, it says that StellarParticle used SSH to log into a public-facing system with a local account and also used RDP with different domain accounts. They also used VPNs and exported saved passwords from Chrome. So, they started by accessing systems through various means, including credential theft and using different access methods.

Moving on to Persistence, the outline mentions credential hopping. Credential hopping is when an attacker uses stolen credentials to access more systems by moving through the network. They also used accounts with Delegated Admin rights to access O365 tenants and created persistence. Specifically, TrailBlazer malware was set up for WMI persistence, and GoldMax for crontab persistence. Additionally, they added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new ones to maintain access.

The question is about whether they will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations after using credential hopping and setting up TrailBlazer. So, the key points here are credential hopping and TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

Credential hopping is a lateral movement technique where the attacker uses stolen credentials to access more machines. Once they have access to a system, they can use tools to steal cookies, which are used for accessing web sessions. TrailBlazer, as mentioned, is used for WMI persistence, which allows the malware to maintain access by using Windows Management Instrumentation.

So, the sequence would be: they use credential hopping to move laterally, and then use TrailBlazer to persist. But the question is about stealing web session cookies after using these techniques. Since credential hopping involves accessing more systems, and TrailBlazer is for persistence, it's likely that after moving laterally using credential hopping, they would then use tools to extract cookies, possibly from the systems they've accessed, which could include end-user workstations.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, they would steal web session cookies after using credential hopping and setting up TrailBlazer for persistence.

The StellarParticle campaign, after using credential hopping to access more systems and configuring TrailBlazer for WMI persistence, would indeed steal web session cookies from end-user workstations. Credential hopping allows lateral movement, and TrailBlazer's persistence ensures ongoing access, making it likely they would extract cookies to maintain access.

Final Answer: A: Yes
