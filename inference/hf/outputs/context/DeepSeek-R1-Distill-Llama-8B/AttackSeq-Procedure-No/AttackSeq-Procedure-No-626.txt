Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the SombRAT backdoor from the CostaRicto Campaign will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence, which includes Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, and Command and Control (C2) stages.

Starting with Initial Access, the attackers used stolen credentials and SSH tools for remote access. They set up a tunnel using proxying, which suggests they have a way to hide their traffic. The tunnel uses a private key for authentication, which is a common practice to maintain anonymity.

Moving on to Execution, they used various methods to deploy a 64-bit backdoor via PowerShell and a 32-bit backdoor with a custom loader. The use of PowerSploit modules like Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection indicates they're using some advanced techniques for injecting malicious code into memory, which can help bypass some detection mechanisms.

For Defense Evasion, they used process injection and deobfuscation techniques. This makes sense because using these methods can help avoid detection by making their activities less obvious to security tools.

In the Discovery phase, SombRAT has capabilities for process and system information discovery, which means they can gather a lot of data about the compromised environment. They also used tools like pscan and nmap for network scanning, which helps in identifying potential targets or vulnerabilities.

Collection involves using the SombRAT backdoor to archive data, which means they're gathering information that can be used for further attacks or exfiltration.

Now, the Command and Control (C2) section is crucial. The backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP. The traffic is SSL-encrypted, which is a strong encryption method. They also bypass HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies, which means they can route their traffic through different networks without being blocked. The C2 domain is hardcoded and obfuscated, making it harder to detect. Additionally, they use RSA encryption for the AES key exchange, which adds another layer of security to their communications.

The question is whether SombRAT will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol. From the outline, the C2 communication uses DNS and HTTP tunneling, which are both protocols. However, the question is about exfiltration, which is data transfer, not C2 communication.

Looking at the C2 methods, they use protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, but for exfiltration, they might use the same or different protocols. The outline doesn't explicitly mention HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration. However, since they're using encrypted communication for C2, it's possible they might use similar secure protocols for exfiltration to avoid detection.

But wait, the question specifies using a non-C2 protocol. The C2 is already using DNS and HTTP, so if they use HTTPS or SMTPS, those are different protocols. However, the outline doesn't mention these for exfiltration. It's more about their C2 communication.

The key point is that the C2 uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which are their own protocols. Exfiltration might use other methods, but the outline doesn't specify. Since the question is about whether they will use HTTPS or SMTPS, which are different from their C2 methods, but the outline doesn't provide info on exfiltration protocols. However, since the C2 uses encrypted methods, it's possible they might use similar ones, but the question is about non-C2 protocols.

Wait, the question is whether they will use HTTPS or SMTPS with a non-C2 protocol. The C2 uses DNS and HTTP, so if they use HTTPS, that's a different protocol. But the outline doesn't mention exfiltration methods, so maybe they don't use these for that. Alternatively, maybe they use their own C2 protocols for exfiltration as well.

But the question is specifically about exfiltration using non-C2 protocols. Since the C2 uses DNS and HTTP, using HTTPS or SMTPS would be non-C2. However, the outline doesn't specify, so I have to infer. Since the C2 uses encrypted communication, it's possible they might use HTTPS, but the question is about non-C2, which would mean they're using other protocols. But without explicit info, it's unclear.

Wait, the outline says the C2 uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which are their own methods. Exfiltration might use the same or different. The question is whether they will use HTTPS or SMTPS, which are different from their C2 methods. Since the C2 uses HTTP, using HTTPS would be a non-C2 protocol. But the outline doesn't mention exfiltration methods, so maybe they don't use these. Alternatively, they might use their own C2 protocols for exfiltration as well.

But the question is about using a non-C2 protocol, so if they use HTTPS or SMTPS, which are non-C2, but the outline doesn't specify. However, the C2 uses HTTP, so maybe they stick with their own. Alternatively, they might use other protocols for exfiltration.

Wait, the outline says the C2 uses HTTP and DNS tunneling, and the communication is SSL-encrypted. So for exfiltration, they might use the same or similar methods. But the question is about using non-C2 protocols, so HTTPS and SMTPS are non-C2. Since the C2 uses HTTP, using HTTPS would be a different protocol, but the outline doesn't specify. However, the question is whether they will use these, and the answer choices are Yes or No.

Given that the C2 uses HTTP, it's possible they might use HTTPS for exfiltration, but the outline doesn't confirm. However, the question is about using a non-C2 protocol, which HTTPS is. But without explicit info, it's a guess. Alternatively, they might not use these because their C2 is already using HTTP.

Wait, the outline says the C2 uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, which are their own methods. So for exfiltration, they might use the same or different. The question is whether they will use HTTPS or SMTPS, which are non-C2. Since the C2 uses HTTP, maybe they don't need to use HTTPS for exfiltration because they already have a secure method. Or perhaps they do. But the outline doesn't specify, so I have to make an educated guess.

Given that the C2 uses HTTP, it's possible they might use HTTPS for exfiltration, but the question is about non-C2 protocols. Since the C2 uses HTTP, using HTTPS would be a non-C2 protocol. However, the outline doesn't mention exfiltration methods, so it's unclear. But the question is whether it's likely, so considering they use encrypted communication, they might use HTTPS. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
</think>

The CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication, which is encrypted. While the outline doesn't explicitly mention exfiltration protocols, considering their use of encrypted methods, it's plausible they might use HTTPS or SMTPS for exfiltration, which are non-C2 protocols. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
