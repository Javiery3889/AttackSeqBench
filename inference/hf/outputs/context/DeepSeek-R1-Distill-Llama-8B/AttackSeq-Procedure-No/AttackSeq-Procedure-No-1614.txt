Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the collected email accounts from Microsoft Outlook MAPI will be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes a cyber attack campaign called Cosmic Banker, targeting Mexican and Brazilian banking institutions. The attack starts with a phishing email pretending to be from the Mexican tax department, which includes a malicious .bat file. When the user runs this, it triggers a PowerShell script that downloads a file called md.zip. This zip contains the main malware library, an Autolt toolkit, and other files. 

The malicious .bat file creates a random folder in the %Public% directory and renames some files. The PowerShell script also has base64 strings for persistence, creating shortcuts and scheduled tasks. The malware then steals credentials by showing a fake update request and accesses Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts. These contacts are then used to send more emails, possibly for Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.

Looking at the question, it's asking if the collected email accounts are automatically exfiltrated over FTP. The CTI outline mentions that after accessing Outlook MAPI, the collected email accounts are sent through a POST web request. It doesn't explicitly mention FTP, but it does talk about communication with specific domains like h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net. 

The question is whether the exfiltration is via FTP. The outline doesn't specify the protocol used for sending the data. It says the data is sent through a POST web request, which could be HTTP or HTTPS. Since FTP is a different protocol, and the CTI doesn't mention it, I think the answer is no. The exfiltration is likely done via a web request, not FTP.

The CTI outline specifies that the collected email accounts are sent via a POST web request, not mentioning FTP. Therefore, the exfiltration is not via FTP.

Final Answer: B: No
