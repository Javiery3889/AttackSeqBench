Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Derusbi will retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before binding to a raw socket and initiating communication with the C2 server after using the Turbo LKM to modify the system's global call table. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. The attack starts with initial access via SSH, downloading malware using wget. The malware is compiled on the same day, so it's likely active. Then, upon execution, it uses a custom loader to load Derusbi into memory. Derusbi drops a kernel module called Turbo, which it loads into the kernel and then deletes itself from the disk to avoid detection. The Turbo module is used to hide user-space processes, making it harder to detect malicious activities.

Looking at the persistence part, Turbo provides persistence by hiding processes. So, once it's on the system, it's working to keep itself hidden. For defense evasion, Derusbi and Turbo use cloaking and anti-analysis techniques. The Turbo LKM modifies the system's global call table, specifically process IDs, allowing processes to hide and unhide. It also modifies the CPU's control register to change the system call table, which probably affects how processes are tracked or detected.

Now, the question is about whether Derusbi will retrieve metadata for files on disk or list the current working directory before it binds to a raw socket and communicates with the C2 server. The options are Yes or No.

I think about what Derusbi does after initial execution. It drops the Turbo kernel module, which is used for hiding. After that, it probably needs to establish communication with its C2 server. To do that, it needs to set up a connection, which involves binding to a socket. But before that, does it need to gather any metadata?

Well, when a process wants to communicate over the network, it needs to know its own port or IP. If the system call table is modified, maybe it can create a socket without being detected. But does it need to list the current working directory or retrieve file metadata before this?

The current working directory is often used for process operations, but if the system call table is modified, maybe it can create sockets without needing to list the directory. Metadata retrieval might involve functions like scandir or dir, which could be affected by the modified system calls. If the system call table is altered, these functions might not work as expected, so Derusbi might not need to list the directory because it can get the necessary information through other means or because the modifications allow it to do so without being detected.

Alternatively, if the system call table is modified, maybe functions related to file operations are also altered, so Derusbi might not need to list the directory because it can access the necessary information directly or through other methods. Therefore, it might not need to retrieve metadata or list the directory because the modifications provide it with the necessary capabilities to communicate without revealing itself.

So, putting it all together, after using the Turbo LKM to modify the system call table, Derusbi might not need to retrieve metadata or list the current working directory because the modifications allow it to establish a connection without those steps. Therefore, the answer is No.

The analysis indicates that after using the Turbo LKM to modify the system's global call table, Derusbi can establish communication with the C2 server without needing to retrieve metadata for files or list the current working directory. The modifications allow it to hide and evade detection, enabling it to perform its actions undetected.

Final Answer: B: No
