Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of using shared MSP infrastructure before exfiltrating data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes APT10's tactics in detail, organized by MITRE ATT&CK categories like Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, etc. 

Starting with the Execution section, it mentions that APT10 uses tools like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access. They also use credential theft tools such as mimikatz or PwDump. This suggests they have access to compromised systems and can gather credentials, which might include admin or domain admin privileges.

Moving on to Privilege Escalation, it's clear that APT10 uses stolen MSP credentials to gain higher-level permissions. So, they have access to a lot of credentials, possibly including those from Managed Service Providers.

In the Discovery phase, they use common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools to map out the network. This phase is about understanding the environment and identifying targets.

Looking at the Collection phase, APT10 stages data for exfiltration, often placing it in the Recycle Bin using compression tools via remote command execution scripts. They might use legitimate tools like Robocopy or PSCP for this.

Now, the question is about whether they abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of using MSP infrastructure. From the outline, APT10 has a history of using MSPs for lateral movement and data exfiltration. They have been observed using MSP credentials for access and have tools like mimikatz for credential theft. 

AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) SAML tokens can be a way to move laterally within a network, especially if the token is compromised. However, the outline doesn't mention APT10 specifically using SAML tokens. Instead, it emphasizes their use of MSP infrastructure for movement and data exfiltration. 

Since the outline mentions that APT10 has a method that includes leveraging MSP infrastructure, it's more likely they would use that method rather than a different approach like SAML token abuse. There's no indication in the CTI that they've shifted to using SAML tokens as an alternative. Therefore, the answer is No, they are not likely to use the SAML token in this case.

The analysis indicates that APT10 typically leverages MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration, as detailed in the CTI outline. There's no mention of using SAML tokens, so the correct answer is No.

Final Answer: B: No
