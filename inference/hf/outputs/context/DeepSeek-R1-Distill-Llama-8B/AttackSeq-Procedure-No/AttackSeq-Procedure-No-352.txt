Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before setting up its command and control using a custom TCP protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that the attack started with emails containing a weaponized RTF document that exploited CVE-2012-0158. This document dropped a PE file named svchost.exe, which is a downloader. So the initial step is the delivery of this malicious file.

The malware is described as MSIL/Crimson, which is a modular malware family. It uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with its C&C servers. Some modules don't have C&C capabilities and rely on a RAT component for things like data exfiltration. The malware can download additional payloads, which are often used for keylogging, stealing browser credentials, and other invasive actions like using webcams or stealing email.

Looking at the question, it's asking if the malware will execute native Windows functions before establishing C&C. The options are Yes or No.

I remember that when malware drops a file, it often needs to perform certain operations on the system. Since the initial file is a PE, it's likely a Windows executable. Malware, especially when it's a downloader, might need to extract itself or other components. To do that, it might use functions like GetFileAttributesW to check file properties or GetSystemInfo to gather system information.

The CTI outline mentions that the malware is modular, so it's possible that after the initial download, it unpacks or runs other modules. These modules might require accessing system functions to perform their tasks. For example, if a module is responsible for data exfiltration, it might need to gather information about the system to decide how to exfiltrate data effectively.

The fact that some modules lack C&C but rely on RAT suggests that they might perform actions independently before establishing full communication. So, it's plausible that before the malware can fully communicate with its C&C server, it needs to gather some initial information using native functions.

Therefore, it's likely that the malware would execute functions like GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo as part of its initial operations to set up the necessary environment or gather information before it can use its custom TCP protocol for C&C.

The MSIL/Crimson malware is likely to execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo during its initial stages to gather system information and prepare for further operations before establishing command and control communication.

Final Answer: A: Yes
