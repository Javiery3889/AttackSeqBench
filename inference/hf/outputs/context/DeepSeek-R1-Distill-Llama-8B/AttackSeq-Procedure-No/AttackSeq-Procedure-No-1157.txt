Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in this scenario will lock out the original account owners by changing their passwords before using phishing sites to collect credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attackers targeted Instagram influencers. They impersonated technical support or friends, sending phishing emails, messages on Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram. The emails and messages claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges to trick the victims into visiting phishing sites that looked like Instagram. These sites then asked for credentials, which the attackers collected.

The impact mentioned is that the attackers demanded ransoms in Bitcoin, credit cards, or vouchers. Even when some victims paid, the attackers didn't restore access and kept demanding more payments. They also used the stolen accounts with large followings to continue scams and sell their hacking skills in the cyber underground.

So, the question is whether the attackers would change the passwords to lock out the original owners before using the phishing sites. Let me think about the typical behavior of such attackers. Phishing sites are used to collect credentials, so once the victim enters their username and password on the fake site, the attackers get that information. If the attackers change the password right after the phishing, they can lock the victim out, making it harder for the victim to regain access.

But wait, in this case, the attackers are using the stolen accounts to continue their operations. So maybe they don't need to change the password because they already have access through the phishing. Changing the password might not be necessary if they can just use the stolen credentials directly. Plus, if they change the password, they might risk the victim noticing the account is compromised, especially if two-factor authentication is enabled.

Also, the CTI mentions that the attackers didn't restore access even after receiving payments, implying they might not have the capability or intention to change the password. They're more focused on using the accounts for their own gain rather than securing them by changing passwords.

So, putting it together, it's unlikely the attackers would change the passwords before using the phishing sites. They probably just collect the credentials and use them as is without altering the original accounts.

The attackers in this scenario are likely not to lock out the original account owners by changing their passwords. They are more focused on using the stolen credentials directly through phishing sites rather than altering the original accounts. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
