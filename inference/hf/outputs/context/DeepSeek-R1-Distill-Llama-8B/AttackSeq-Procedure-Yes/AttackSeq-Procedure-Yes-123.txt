Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware after the 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers to send recon info or download files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It describes the attack sequence used by Agrius, which is a cyber threat group. The outline is divided into four main sections: Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Command and Control.

Starting with Initial Access, Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically targeting FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and using SQL injection. This allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP. So, their initial entry into the network was through these vulnerabilities.

Next, during Execution, they deployed a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor is used for exfiltration, deploying more malware, and has persistence features. It's registered as a service, which helps it survive system reboots.

Looking at Persistence, they used webshells and the 'IPsec Helper' service to maintain access. This makes sense because once a backdoor is registered as a service, it can automatically start on boot, ensuring persistence.

For Defense Evasion, they used obfuscated webshells, like ASPXSpy, and the 'IPsec Helper' had self-deletion capabilities. This shows they're trying to avoid detection by removing their traces after use.

Lateral Movement involved using webshells for RDP tunneling and compromised accounts. They also used tools for credential harvesting, which helps them move across the network laterally.

Command and Control is handled by 'IPsec Helper' communicating over HTTP with C2 servers. The configuration file has encrypted server addresses, and the malware waits for commands from these relays. The possible commands include updating relays, sending recon (reconnaissance) info, downloading files, and self-deletion.

Now, the question is about whether after 'IPsec Helper' sends recon info or downloads files, Agrius would deploy 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD'. 

I know that 'Apostle' is a wiper malware, which means it's used for data destruction. 'DEADWOOD' is another wiper, often used for overwriting files. These are typically used in the later stages of an attack, after initial access, lateral movement, and establishing command and control.

In the CTI outline, after establishing C2 communication, the next logical step would be to escalate their actions. Deploying wiper malware would be part of data destruction, which is a common post-arrival action once they've gained access and have a foothold in the network.

The 'IPsec Helper' is used for exfiltration and deploying more malware, so after using it to send recon or download files, it's plausible they would proceed to more destructive actions like deploying wipers. There's no mention in the outline of them not using these tools, so it's likely they would deploy them.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, Agrius is likely to deploy these wipers after that step.

The analysis indicates that after establishing command and control with 'IPsec Helper', deploying 'Apostle' and 'DEADWOOD' is a probable next step for data destruction.

Final Answer: A: Yes
