Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers in this case would demand a ransom after locking out the victims by changing their Instagram passwords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attackers targeted Instagram influencers through phishing emails, pretending to be support or friends. They used platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to send these messages. The phishing sites they set up asked for credentials, which the victims provided, thinking it was genuine. Once they had the login details, the attackers changed the passwords, locking the users out. They also downloaded data like images and messages.

So, the question is, would they then demand a ransom? I know that ransomware attackers typically do, but this seems more like a phishing and credential theft rather than a ransomware attack. Phishing for credentials is a common tactic, and once they have access, they can do various things like lock the account or demand payment to unlock it. But in this case, they've already changed the password, which effectively locks the user out. They might not need to demand a ransom because they already have control.

Wait, but sometimes attackers might still ask for a ransom even if they have access. Maybe they want more money or threaten to release sensitive data. But in this case, they've already taken the data by downloading it, so maybe they don't need to demand a ransom. They could just threaten to release the data unless the victim pays, but the question is specifically about demanding a ransom after changing the password.

I think in this scenario, since they've already changed the password and have the data, they might not need to demand a ransom. They could just threaten to release the data, but the question is about demanding a ransom after changing the password. So maybe they don't need to, because they've already achieved their goal of access. Alternatively, they might still ask for a ransom as a form of extortion, but it's not clear from the outline.

Looking at the answer choices, A is yes and B is no. The outline doesn't mention any ransom demands, but based on typical behavior, I think they might not need to because they've already compromised the accounts. So the answer is probably B: No.
</think>

The attackers in this case used phishing to obtain Instagram credentials, changed the passwords to lock users out, and downloaded data. While ransom is common in cyberattacks, here they've already achieved access, so demanding a ransom isn't necessary. 

Final Answer: B
