Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN13 will use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE after exploiting external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It says that FIN13 is a cybercriminal group targeting Mexico, active since 2017, with activities going back to 2016. They focus on financial, retail, and hospitality sectors. Their tactics include long-term intrusions, mapping victim networks, capturing credentials, and stealing sensitive documents for fraudulent money transfers. Unlike ransomware groups, they use custom passive backdoors and tools, which means they don't typically use ransomware but instead focus on traditional cybercrime.

Moving on to Initial Access, it mentions that FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware, specifically BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK. These web shells are a consistent gateway into their victim networks. So, the initial step is deploying these tools.

Next, under Persistence, the outline states that FIN13 uses various methods, including replacing legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to log passwords. They also deploy malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR. Additionally, they use email communications for command and control with a backdoor called MAILSLOT. So, after initial access, they move on to establishing persistence using these tools.

The question is whether they use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE before moving on to other persistence methods. From the outline, BLUEAGAVE is mentioned as a tool they deploy during initial access. It's described as a custom passive backdoor that establishes a local HTTP server on high ephemeral ports to listen for incoming HTTP requests and execute commands. So, after deploying web shells and malware, they do use BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor.

Then, they proceed to use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries for persistence. So the sequence is: web shells and custom malware deployment, followed by using BLUEAGAVE as a passive backdoor, and then moving on to other persistence techniques.

Looking at the question, it asks if they will employ BLUEAGAVE before using SIXPACK and KeePass binaries. Based on the outline, the answer is yes. Therefore, the correct choice is A: Yes.

The CTI outline indicates that after exploiting external servers, FIN13 deploys web shells and custom malware, including BLUEAGAVE, a passive backdoor. They then use other methods like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass for persistence. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A
