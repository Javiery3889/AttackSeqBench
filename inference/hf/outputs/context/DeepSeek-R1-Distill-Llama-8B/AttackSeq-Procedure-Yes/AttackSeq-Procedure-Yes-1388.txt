Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to get encrypted addresses of C&C servers before communicating with them using Telegram features. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that the Raccoon stealer is used in the campaign. It collects system info, account data, bank cards, and crypto wallet details. It also accesses config files. The Vidar stealer is another tool used, collecting similar data. 

In the Execution phase, after the malware is run, it communicates with C&C servers via Telegram. The C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'. So, the initial communication is through Telegram, but the servers are encrypted, which probably means they're hidden or not easily detectable.

The question is about whether, after collecting data, the Raccoon stealer would make network requests to a Telegram channel to get the C&C server addresses. Then, it would use those addresses to communicate, possibly bypassing blocks.

Looking at the Command and Control phase, it's mentioned that the C&C servers used Telegram's legitimate features, which suggests that the communication isn't direct but uses the platform's built-in capabilities. The servers are encrypted, so maybe the addresses are shared via a Telegram channel, which would require the stealer to reach out to that channel to retrieve them.

So, the Raccoon stealer, after collecting data, would likely need to contact the Telegram channel to get the encrypted C&C server addresses. Then, it would use those addresses to communicate securely, avoiding detection.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes, the Raccoon stealer would make network requests to the Telegram channel to get the encrypted C&C addresses before using them.

The Raccoon stealer, after collecting data, would likely request encrypted C&C server addresses from the Telegram channel 'blintick' to communicate securely and bypass detection.

Final Answer: A: Yes
