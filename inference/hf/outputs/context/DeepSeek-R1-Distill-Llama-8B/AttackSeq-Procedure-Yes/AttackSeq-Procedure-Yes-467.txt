Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Hidden Cobra will develop Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files under the Resource Development tactic. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that Hidden Cobra is targeting cryptocurrency and financial organizations, specifically in Turkey. The initial access is through spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878. This exploit allows arbitrary code execution, leading to the Bankshot implant being downloaded.

The Bankshot implant is designed to persist on the network for further exploitation. It's mentioned that the implant can communicate with control servers, which are online gambling sites in Chinese. The implant can also wipe files and erase evidence, indicating some level of persistence and destructive capabilities.

The question is whether, after the initial access, Hidden Cobra will develop Bankshot to give attackers full control and file-wiping abilities under the Resource Development tactic. I know that Resource Development in MITRE ATT&CK refers to activities like creating tools, implants, and other resources used in attacks.

Looking at the CTI, the Bankshot implant already has persistence and file-wiping features. It's used for initial access and further exploitation. The fact that it's tied to previous attacks, including against a major Korean bank, suggests that Hidden Cobra is expanding its capabilities. The mention of the implant being used since November 2017 indicates it's a mature tool.

Since the initial access is via a known exploit and the implant already has persistence and destructive capabilities, it's logical that Hidden Cobra would further develop it to enhance its capabilities, including full control over systems and more extensive file-wiping. This aligns with the Resource Development tactic as they're refining their tools for more impactful attacks.

So, considering all this, the answer should be yes, they are likely to develop it with those capabilities.

The analysis indicates that Hidden Cobra's Bankshot implant, already used for initial access and persistence, is likely to be further developed to grant attackers full system control and file-wiping abilities. This aligns with the Resource Development tactic, as the implant's existing features suggest an expansion of capabilities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
