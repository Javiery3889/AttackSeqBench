Okay, so I need to figure out whether Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase after creating fake websites to steal credentials. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that Charming Kitten's campaign involved fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram. These were used to extract credentials. The initial stage involved sending socially engineered emails from fake researchers or journalists, inviting victims to events. So, the first phase was sending these emails, which would be part of the reconnaissance phase, I think.

The question is specifically about whether they targeted non-Iranian researchers during this phase. The outline also mentions that the attackers used email trackers to monitor if their phishing emails were forwarded and collected geolocation and IP data. Additionally, they used a cookie to gather data from the victim's machine.

In the "Others" section, it's noted that ClearSky Security attributed the campaign to Charming Kitten, pointing to factors like the use of specific websites, targeting non-Iranian investigators whose expertise matches the group's TTPs, and impersonation of NIAC, which suggests an Iranian actor. So, the group is linked to Iran.

Putting this together, the initial phase involved sending emails to victims, including non-Iranian researchers, to gather information. The fake emails were part of the reconnaissance phase, which would involve targeting these individuals to gather data and credentials. The fact that the attackers used fake websites and email tracking suggests they were monitoring and collecting data from various sources, including researchers.

Looking at the answer choices, the question is whether they targeted non-Iranian researchers during the reconnaissance phase. The CTI outline says they did target non-Iranian investigators, so the answer should be yes.

The CTI outline indicates that Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers during the reconnaissance phase by sending socially engineered emails impersonating researchers or journalists. This aligns with the question's context, confirming that the answer is yes.
