Okay, so I need to figure out whether APT15 deployed backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS after obtaining domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, I see that APT15 used Mimikatz to get domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate. That's for the Credential Access part. So they have access to the network via VPN, and they have high-level permissions within the network.

Next, under the Execution section, it mentions that APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI is described as a tool that bypasses command prompt policies by patching cmd.exe. RoyalDNS works through DNS to execute commands and is persistent, using DNS for communication instead of HTTP.

So, after they've gained access with Mimikatz, it's logical that they would deploy these backdoors to maintain persistence and control over the network. RoyalCLI would help them avoid certain policy restrictions, making it easier to execute commands without being blocked by settings that disable command prompts. RoyalDNS is another way to maintain access, using DNS for command execution, which is a different method from the usual HTTP-based communication.

The question is specifically asking if they deployed these backdoors after obtaining the credentials and VPN access. Since the Execution section comes after Credential Access in the attack sequence, it makes sense that the backdoor deployment would follow the initial access. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they did deploy those backdoors, including RoyalCLI to bypass policies.

The attack sequence described in the CTI outline indicates that after obtaining domain admin credentials and a VPN certificate, APT15 proceeded to deploy backdoors. RoyalCLI was used to bypass command prompt policies, and RoyalDNS was employed for persistent DNS-based communication. This aligns with the question's scenario, confirming that the backdoors were indeed deployed.

Final Answer: A
