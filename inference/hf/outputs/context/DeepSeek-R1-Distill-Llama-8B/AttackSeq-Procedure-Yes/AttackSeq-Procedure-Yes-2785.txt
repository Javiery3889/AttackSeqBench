Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app, which is malware on iOS devices, will exfiltrate data like text messages, contacts, and location via HTTP requests using a Base64 token. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that the XAgent app is malware that's installed on compromised iOS devices. It's similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows. The app is designed to collect a lot of data: text messages, contacts, pictures, location, installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status. It runs in the background and is hard to terminate on iOS 7 but behaves differently on iOS 8, which was released in 2014.

The question is about whether this data gets exfiltrated via HTTP using a Base64 token. I remember that Base64 encoding is a way to transfer data in plain text, often used in HTTP requests. Malware might use this to avoid detection or to send data in a way that's not easily blocked.

Looking at the attack sequence, the initial access is through a poisoned pawn, which leads to the malware being installed. Then, during execution, the app collects all that data. The question is about the exfiltration part. Since the app is designed to collect data, it's logical that it would send this information back to its command and control (C&C) server. Using Base64 makes sense because it's a common encoding method for transferring data over HTTP, which is what the app would use to communicate with the server.

I don't see any information in the outline that says the app doesn't use HTTP or Base64, so it's more likely that it does. Therefore, the answer should be yes.
</think>

The XAgent app, after collecting sensitive data, is expected to exfiltrate it via HTTP using a Base64 token, as this is a common method for securely transmitting data over HTTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
