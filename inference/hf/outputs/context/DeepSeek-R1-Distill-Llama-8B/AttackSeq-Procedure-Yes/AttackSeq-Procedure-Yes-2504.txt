Okay, so I need to figure out whether the SHOTPUT backdoor from APT3's phishing campaign communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses, while the GH0ST RAT from APT18 calls out to their own CnC. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, I see that APT3's phishing emails contained URLs that led to a malicious Adobe Flash file. This file downloaded an obfuscated GIF, which had a SHOTPUT payload. SHOTPUT is a DLL backdoor. The backdoor communicates over HTTP to hardcoded command and control (CnC) addresses. So, yes, the SHOTPUT from APT3 does use hardcoded CnC addresses.

Then, APT18's phishing campaign delivered a GH0ST RAT. The GH0ST RAT variant called out to a known APT18 CnC address, which is 223.25.233.248. So, GH0ST RAT uses a hardcoded CnC address specific to APT18.

The question is asking if both backdoors use hardcoded CnC addresses. From the outline, both SHOTPUT and GH0ST RAT do use hardcoded CnC addresses. Therefore, the answer should be yes.
</think>

The SHOTPUT backdoor from APT3 communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses, and the GH0ST RAT from APT18 also uses a hardcoded CnC address. Therefore, both backdoors do use hardcoded CnC addresses.

Final Answer: A
