Okay, so I need to figure out whether Yellow Garuda exfiltrates data from Telegram and stores it in SQLite and JSON. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the CTI outline says that Yellow Garuda uses a Telegram 'grabber' tool. This tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data. So, the first part of the question is about exfiltration. The tool exfiltrates this data, so that's a yes.

Next, it mentions that the exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format. SQLite is a common database format, and JSON is a data interchange format. So, the data is stored in both of these formats.

Looking at the question, it's asking if the data is exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite and JSON. The CTI outline confirms both exfiltration and storage methods.

So, the answer should be yes, which is option A.

The CTI outline explicitly states that Yellow Garuda's Telegram 'grabber' tool exfiltrates data and stores it in both SQLite and JSON formats. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
