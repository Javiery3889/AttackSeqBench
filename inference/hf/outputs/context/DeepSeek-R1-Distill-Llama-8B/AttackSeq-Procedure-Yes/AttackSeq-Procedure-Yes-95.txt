Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the HTA file from the RTF document will communicate with the C2 server and use webserv-redir.net for Command and Control. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I see that the attack starts with exploiting CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document. This document drops an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net. The HTA file is designed to avoid using PowerShell, which is a common tool that's often monitored, so it uses VBS instead. 

Next, the HTA checks for installed antivirus software using WMI. If it doesn't find any, it proceeds to execute a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which is extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe. This backdoor is a VB script that uses a modified msvbvm60.dll, renamed to 8EBECD7C.dll. 

For persistence, the backdoor creates a registry key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WinSrv. 

In terms of defense evasion, the HTA avoids PowerShell and uses DLL sideloading with cmpbk32.dll to run Srvstr.exe. 

The HTA also uses WMI to discover installed antivirus products. 

Looking at the question, it's asking if the HTA will communicate with the C2 server and use webserv-redir.net for Command and Control. 

From the outline, the HTA file is from webserv-redir.net, and the backdoor (FinalBot.exe) communicates with the C2 server. The IOC includes the domain webserv-redir.net with the IP 185.106.120.43. Also, the RTF document has a URL pointing to webserv-redir.net. 

So, the HTA's initial communication is to download from webserv-redir.net, and the backdoor uses it for C2. Therefore, it's likely that the HTA does communicate with the C2 server via webserv-redir.net.
</think>

The HTA file, after checking for antivirus software, executes the FinalBot backdoor, which communicates with the C2 server via webserv-redir.net. The domain is used for both initial download and Command and Control.

Final Answer: A: Yes
