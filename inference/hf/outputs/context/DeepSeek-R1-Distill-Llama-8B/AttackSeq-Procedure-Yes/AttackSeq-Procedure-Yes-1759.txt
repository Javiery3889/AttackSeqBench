Okay, so I need to figure out whether Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after using HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, and then use those payloads to maintain control over compromised systems during their cyber espionage activities. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes a cyber attack by Shuckworm, also known as Gamaredon or Armageddon, against a Ukrainian organization. The attack started with a phishing email that delivered a malicious document containing a custom backdoor called Pterodo. The initial access was on July 14, 2021.

After the initial compromise, Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and activate the backdoor. On July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed, and on July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload. So, the VNC client was the final payload delivered.

Looking at the persistence section, Shuckworm created scheduled tasks to execute malicious VBS files every few minutes to ensure their backdoor remains active even after system reboots. For defense evasion, they used mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings, along with scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection.

In the collection phase, between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts. It's mentioned that during this period, the documents accessed might have been for exfiltration of sensitive information.

The "Others" section adds more context. Shuckworm has been active since at least 2013, using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks. Symantec found seven files used by Shuckworm, all 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries, including VBS files, a VNC client, and Process Explorer binary. IOCs show C&C IPs from specific hosting providers and malicious files in directories starting with 'd'. The SSU report attributes over 5,000 attacks since 2014, targeting over 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

Now, the question is about whether Shuckworm would download additional payloads after using HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers and then use those payloads to maintain control.

From the outline, after the initial infection, Shuckworm executed various scripts and backdoors. On July 16, they executed more Pterodo variants, and on July 28, they installed a VNC client as the ultimate payload. This suggests that after establishing initial access, they progressively deploy additional tools to maintain control.

In the collection phase, they used VBS scripts and backdoors, which might involve data exfiltration. The VNC client was the final payload, which could be used for lateral movement or exfiltration. The fact that they used HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers implies they might use these communications to receive further instructions or additional payloads.

Shuckworm's behavior includes using various tools like VBS scripts, HTA files, and other binaries. Since they used HTTP, it's plausible they would download more payloads via this method to enhance their control over the system, such as additional malware or tools for data collection or persistence.

So, considering the attack sequence and the tools used, it's likely that after using HTTP to communicate, Shuckworm would download additional payloads to maintain control, possibly for further exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious activities.

The analysis indicates that Shuckworm, after using HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, is likely to download additional payloads to maintain control over compromised systems. This aligns with their pattern of progressively deploying tools like VNC clients and other binaries to achieve their objectives.

Final Answer: A: Yes
