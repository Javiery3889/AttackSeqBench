Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Moafee and DragonOK, after using spear-phishing emails to gain initial access, will use custom-built backdoors and RATs during the resource development phase before employing environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks. 

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that both groups use custom-built backdoors and RATs such as CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as some publicly available ones like PoisonIvy. These tools are used to maintain access to the victim networks. So, after initial access via phishing, they probably deploy these backdoors and RATs to establish persistence and control over the compromised systems.

The outline also talks about their use of evasion techniques, including environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents. Specifically, the CT/NewCT payload checks the number of CPU cores to avoid detection in virtualized environments. This suggests that after initial access, they do use these evasion techniques to avoid detection while executing their payloads.

So, the sequence would be: initial access via phishing, then deploying custom tools (backdoors and RATs), and then using those tools along with evasion techniques like CPU checks. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they do use the custom tools before employing the evasion methods.

The CTI outline clearly states that Moafee and DragonOK use custom-built backdoors and RATs after initial access. They employ these tools to maintain access and then use techniques like CPU core checks for evasion. Thus, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A
