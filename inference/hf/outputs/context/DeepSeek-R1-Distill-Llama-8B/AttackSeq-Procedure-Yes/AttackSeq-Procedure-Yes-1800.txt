Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers used in the described scenario launched DDoS attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to have a total failure. The CTI outline mentions that FireEye observed two different single-byte XOR keys used by C2 servers to encode configuration files for a DDoS tool called KernelBot. These files instruct the botnet to attack domains and IPs associated with Next Media or Apple daily websites, except a few hosting the HKGolden forum. 

First, I need to understand the attack sequence. The attackers used KernelBot, which is a DDoS tool. The C2 servers sent instructions via XOR-encoded config files, which then told the bots where to attack. The targets included Next Media and Apple sites, but also some HKGolden forums. The Others section adds context that this activity is linked to APT actors, possibly Chinese ones, targeting anti-government activists and involved in IP theft and espionage. They used digital certificates used before, like in QTI and CallTogether, suggesting a common quartermaster.

The question is whether the DDoS attacks caused Next Media's network to fail entirely. The CTI says the attacks were against Next Media and Apple sites, so it's likely that these sites were targeted. The use of a botnet implies a large-scale attack, which could cause significant downtime or failure. The context also suggests the attackers have a history of such activities, possibly as state-sponsored, which would have the resources and persistence to cause a major disruption.

So, putting it together, the attackers did launch DDoS attacks against Next Media, so the answer should be yes.

The attackers used KernelBot, a DDoS tool, instructed by C2 servers to target Next Media and Apple sites, leading to network issues. The context links this to APT actors, suggesting a state-sponsored, resourceful group likely causing significant disruption. Therefore, it's plausible that Next Media's network suffered a total failure.

Final Answer: A: Yes
