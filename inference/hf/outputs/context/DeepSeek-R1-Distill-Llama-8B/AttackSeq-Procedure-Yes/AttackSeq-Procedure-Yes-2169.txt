Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails. The question is asking if this is likely, given some specific techniques they used.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It says that the initial access was through spear phishing emails. These emails had OLE2 format documents with embedded links. When opened in Microsoft Word, these documents sent a GET request to the attacker's server. So, the initial access vector was definitely through these spear phishing emails and the OLE2 documents.

Next, the defense evasion part mentions that the attackers used an undocumented Word feature involving the INCLUDEPICTURE field. This field contains a link, but in Unicode, so Word ignores it as an image but follows the URL attached to a form in the document. This makes the document look benign because there are no macros or active content, thus bypassing security measures. Kaspersky can detect this method, though.

The question is specifically about whether the attackers used a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform them about installed software during reconnaissance. From the outline, it seems that the OLE2 documents did send a GET request when opened, which would be used for initial access. The INCLUDEPICTURE field was used to embed the URL, so when the document is opened, Word follows the link, allowing the attacker to know the document was opened and possibly gather more info.

So, the question is asking if this GET request is part of the initial access. Since the initial access was through these documents, and the GET request is part of how they did that, the answer should be yes. The attackers used this method to gain access, so it's likely they did this.

The attackers used OLE2 documents with embedded links in spear phishing emails, which triggered a GET request upon opening, allowing them to gain initial access. The question asks if this GET request was part of their technique, which aligns with the CTI outline. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
