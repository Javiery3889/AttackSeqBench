Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RevengeRAT will communicate with its command and control servers and send information to specific domains after persistence is established. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I see that the attack starts with a phishing email delivering a malicious PowerPoint add-in. The add-in has a VBA macro that executes an .exe file, specifically mshta.exe, which then downloads a dropper from a Blogspot URL. This dropper contains a VBScript that's hidden and attributed to Microsoft, which then decodes and executes RevengeRAT. 

Next, the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs mshta.exe every two hours. The URL used is hxxps://pocasideiascdt.blogspot.com. The 'Outlook.exe' payload is also mentioned, but it's unclear if it's related to the communication.

The question is about whether RevengeRAT will communicate with its C2 servers and send info to office365update.duckdns.org and systen32.ddns.net. The attacker's infrastructure is in Canada and Brazil.

I know that RevengeRAT is a remote access Trojan, so it's designed to communicate back to its C2. The initial infection uses mshta.exe to download the dropper, which then runs the VBScript and decodes RevengeRAT. The scheduled task runs every two hours, which suggests periodic activity.

The VBScript in the dropper is responsible for executing the malicious actions, including storing the base64 encoded RevengeRAT in the registry and then decoding and executing it. So, after the initial execution, RevengeRAT should be on the system.

Since RevengeRAT is a RAT, it typically communicates over the internet to its C2 servers. The question mentions specific domains, which are likely part of the C2 infrastructure. The attacker's infrastructure is in Canada and Brazil, so the C2 servers might be hosted there as well.

The scheduled task runs mshta.exe, which might be part of the initial download or part of the persistence. However, RevengeRAT itself would need to establish its own communication. The VBScript in the dropper does some actions, but the main RAT would have its own communication methods.

I don't see any information that directly says RevengeRAT is used here, but the presence of the VBScript and the scheduled task suggests that the attacker is setting up persistence and possibly preparing for further communication. The fact that the VBScript is attributed to Microsoft might be a red herring or part of the initial phase to avoid detection.

Given that RevengeRAT is a known RAT, it's likely that once it's on the system, it would attempt to communicate with its C2 servers. The scheduled task might be part of the initial setup, but the actual communication from RevengeRAT would happen after that. The domains mentioned in the question are typical for C2, so it's plausible that RevengeRAT would send data there.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, RevengeRAT would communicate with its C2 and send information to those domains.

The analysis indicates that after establishing persistence, RevengeRAT, being a RAT, would communicate with its C2 servers and send data to the specified domains. The scheduled task and initial VBScript suggest setup for persistence and communication, making it likely that RevengeRAT will indeed send information to the given domains.

Final Answer: A: Yes
