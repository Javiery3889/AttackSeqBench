Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the T9000 malware will use sideloading a malicious DLL through a legitimate executable, specifically igfxtray.exe, before setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistence. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the T9000 malware, which is a variant of the T5000 family. It was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. Upon activation, it starts a multi-stage execution process. The initial shellcode stage locates and executes a secondary shellcode stub, which then decrypts and runs an embedded payload, creating a temp file and executing it with WinExec.

Next, the persistence section mentions that T9000 modifies registry keys like HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows to ensure its DLLs run on reboot or with user mode processes. It also injects ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistent execution.

Looking at the question, it's asking if T9000 will use sideloading via a legitimate executable, specifically igfxtray.exe, before setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll. Sideloading typically involves loading malicious code into a legitimate process, which is a common technique to bypass detection.

From the outline, the initial delivery is via RTF, then a multi-stage process. The persistence methods include registry modifications and DLL injection. The outline doesn't explicitly mention using igfxtray.exe or sideloading, but it does talk about modifying registry keys and injecting a DLL.

I recall that T9000 is known for extensive evasion techniques and was used in targeted attacks. It's part of the T5000 family, which is known for multi-stage attacks and sophisticated persistence methods. Since the outline mentions registry keys and DLL injection, it's plausible that T9000 would use multiple persistence methods, including sideloading.

The question is whether it does this before setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll. The outline doesn't explicitly say, but given that T9000 is a multi-stage malware, it's likely that it uses various methods, including sideloading through a legitimate process like igfxtray.exe, as part of its initial stages to establish persistence.

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely yes, T9000 would use sideloading through igfxtray.exe before setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll.
