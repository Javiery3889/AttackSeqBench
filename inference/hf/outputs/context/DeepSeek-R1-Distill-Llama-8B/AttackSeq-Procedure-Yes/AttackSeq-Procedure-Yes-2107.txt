Okay, so I need to figure out whether the attackers' backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its data collection before sending the data to the C&C server. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, during the Initial Access, the attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents. These documents used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from their server. So, the initial access was through phishing, which is a common tactic.

Next, in the Execution phase, they used Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a backdoor. They used RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities. This multi-stage infection led to the execution of malicious code, so the backdoor was successfully installed.

Moving on to Persistence, the attackers set up a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to run a DLL with rundll32.exe once a day. This helps them maintain a foothold on the system, ensuring the backdoor stays active.

For Defense Evasion, the loader used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques. It gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server. They also used dynamic API resolving to hide functionality, making it harder to detect statically.

In the Discovery phase, the backdoor gathered a lot of detailed information: hostname, OS details, user name, MAC addresses, and WMI info. This data was collected to assess the value of the compromised machine.

Now, the question is about whether the backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its data collection. The CTI outline mentions that during exfiltration, the backdoor exfiltrates data over the C&C channel, which includes screenshots, files, and system information. So, the backdoor does have the capability to send screenshots.

Additionally, the Others section attributes the activity to a Chinese APT group known for refining their tools. Their C&C servers are hosted in various locations, and they use specific tools like RoyalRoad, which suggests they have advanced capabilities.

Putting this together, the backdoor not only collects various data points but also exfiltrates screenshots. Therefore, after collecting the detailed information, it's likely that the backdoor will send screenshots as part of the data transmission to the C&C server.

The backdoor's capabilities include exfiltrating data, which includes screenshots, files, and system information. Therefore, after collecting the data, it communicates with the C&C server, which would include sending screenshots.

Final Answer: A: Yes
