Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Elise malware communicates with its C2 server using an application layer protocol for Command and Control after it collects system information. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, from the outline, I see that the malware is part of the DRAGONFISH group. They're using a malicious Microsoft Word document that drops an executable via CVE-2017-11882. The payload is an Elise malware. 

When the malware runs, it does several things. It starts iexplore.exe in a suspended state and injects NavShExt.dll into it. It creates a mutex called 'donotbotherme' to prevent multiple instances. It also saves data in thumbcache_1CD60.db. Importantly, it sends data to and downloads files or commands from a hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150.14.

Looking at the Execution section, the malware communicates with the C2 server. It's mentioned that it sends data to the server and downloads files or commands. So, this implies a two-way communication, which is typical for C2 communication. 

The question is about whether this communication uses an application layer protocol. Application layer protocols are things like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. Since the C2 is a hardcoded IP, it's likely using a protocol that's commonly used for C&C. Without more details, but given that it's a known C2 server, it's standard for such servers to use protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.

The question is specifically about whether it uses an application layer protocol. Since the malware is using a C2 server, it's highly probable that it's using an application layer protocol for communication. So the answer should be yes.

The Elise malware communicates with its C2 server, which is a hardcoded IP address. This communication involves sending data and downloading files or commands, indicating the use of an application layer protocol like HTTP or HTTPS. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
