Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the PIVY variant of the RAT communicates with C2 servers using application layer protocols after evading defenses through DLL sideloading and configuration changes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that PIVY is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses DLL sideloading. It drops a DLL named ActiveUpdate.dll and a shellcode file Active.dat into a directory called ActiveUpdate_[0-9]{3}. It then copies rundll32.exe to ActiveFlash.exe and executes this new file with the DLL path. This setup allows it to perform malicious actions.

The execution phase mentions that it uses this tactic, which has been used before with different executable names and directory structures. So, the main point here is that it's using a known method for deploying and executing its malicious code.

Now, looking at the defense evasion part, PIVY uses DLL sideloading to load the dropped DLL. This is a common technique to avoid detection because it's less likely to be picked up by traditional antivirus tools that only scan known file types. Additionally, the configuration has been modified to confuse tools that parse the configuration data. Specifically, the C2s are no longer null-padded, and each hostname ends with a null-byte followed by a string that changes slightly with each C2 server. This suggests that the C2 communication is done in a way that's not easily predictable or detectable by standard tools.

The question is whether PIVY will communicate with C2 servers like webserver.servehttp[.]com and admin.nslookupdns[.]com using application layer protocols. Application layer protocols typically include things like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. Since PIVY is a RAT, it's designed for remote access and control, so it's likely to use such protocols for communication.

The Others section mentions that PIVY samples were observed in Myanmar and other Asian countries, possibly targeting post-election activities, similar to the Seven Pointed Dagger campaign. This indicates that the attackers have a specific goal and are using a coordinated approach, which often involves establishing a command and control infrastructure for communication.

Putting this together, since PIVY uses DLL sideloading and modifies its configuration to evade detection, it's likely that it's using application layer protocols to communicate securely with its C2 servers. This would make sense because such protocols are commonly used for undetected communication, especially in targeted campaigns where stealth is crucial. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that PIVY communicates using application layer protocols.

The PIVY variant, after evading defenses through DLL sideloading and configuration changes, is likely to use application layer protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with C2 servers. This aligns with common practices in RATs for undetected communication, especially in targeted campaigns.

Final Answer: A: Yes
