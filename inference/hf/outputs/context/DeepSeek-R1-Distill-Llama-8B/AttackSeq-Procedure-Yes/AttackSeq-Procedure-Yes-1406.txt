Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers in this scenario would use phishing sites to collect Instagram credentials and then lock out the victims by changing their passwords. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I see that the attackers targeted Instagram influencers. They impersonated technical support or friends, sending phishing emails, messages on Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram. The messages were generic greetings or offers of verified badges to trick the victims into visiting fake sites that looked like Instagram. 

So, the first step is that the attackers are using phishing to get the victims to a fake site. That makes sense because the question is about whether they collect credentials there. The outline mentions that the phishing sites asked for credentials, specifically Instagram usernames, passwords, and email addresses. That's the first part of the process.

After they get these credentials, what do they do next? The outline says that despite some victims paying the ransom, the attackers didn't restore access and kept demanding more payments. Also, they used the stolen accounts to continue scams and sold their hacking skills. So, it seems like the attackers are not just after the ransom but also want to maintain control over the accounts.

If the attackers have the credentials, they can log into the Instagram accounts themselves. Once they have access, they can change the password to lock the victim out. That would prevent the victim from regaining access without the new password, which is another layer of control for the attackers.

So putting it together, the sequence is: Phishing the victims to a fake site to collect credentials, then using those credentials to access the real Instagram accounts, and finally changing the passwords to deny access. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they do use the phishing sites to collect credentials and then lock the accounts by changing passwords.

The attackers first use phishing to trick victims into providing credentials on fake sites. Once they obtain these credentials, they access the Instagram accounts and change the passwords, locking the victims out. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
