Okay, so I need to figure out whether the cybercriminals discovered outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol on the medical network perimeter after using tools like masscan and Shodan. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline provided, it's about a report by Denis Makrushin and Yury Namestnikov from March 2018. They mention using masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical keywords. So, masscan is a tool used for network scanning, which helps in finding open ports and services on various IPs.

They also used Shodan and Censys, which are search engines for finding public information about IP addresses and devices. Shodan is known for its database of scanned IPs and related data, while Censys helps in identifying devices and services on those IPs. So, using these tools, they would likely find various devices and services exposed on the network.

The report specifically mentions that they found non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication. Niagara Fox is a protocol used in building management systems, which are often part of medical infrastructure. Printers with web interfaces that don't require authentication are easy targets because they can be accessed via the internet, making them a potential entry point.

The question is whether, after using these tools, the criminals would find outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting MQTT. MQTT is another protocol used for communication in IoT devices, especially in healthcare settings for things like patient monitoring or building automation.

So, considering the tools used, masscan would scan for open ports and services. If the Building Management systems (BMS) are using Niagara Fox, which is a known protocol, and if those systems are outdated, they might have known vulnerabilities. Similarly, medical devices supporting MQTT could be part of the network perimeter if they're not properly secured.

The report also mentions that the criminals found printers with web interfaces without authentication, which is a common issue. This suggests that the network perimeter might have exposed services that aren't properly secured, making it easier to access and exploit them.

The 'Others' section talks about the targeting of pharmaceutical organizations by APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike for exfiltration. This indicates that after gaining access, they might exfiltrate data, but the initial step is reconnaissance to find these entry points.

So, putting it all together, using masscan and Shodan/Censys would help identify various devices and services on the network. Since BMS using Niagara Fox and MQTT devices are part of medical infrastructure, and if they're outdated or misconfigured, they would be found during this phase. Therefore, it's likely that the criminals discovered these systems on the network perimeter during their reconnaissance.

The cybercriminals used tools like masscan and Shodan/Censys to identify potential entry points into medical networks. These tools would reveal various services and devices, including outdated Building Management Systems using Niagara Fox and medical devices supporting MQTT. Since these systems were found, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
