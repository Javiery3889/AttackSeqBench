Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in this CTI outline uses InstallUtil.exe to bypass SmartScreen and AppLocker. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the initial access was via a phishing email with a .lnk file. The .lnk file executed a PowerShell script that then runs a WScript Shell. This shell creates three files: a decoy DOC file, a tool to install .NET files to bypass SmartScreen and AppLocker, and a malicious DLL.

Looking at the Execution section, the PowerShell script checks for administrative privileges. If the user is an admin, it creates a scheduled task with SYSTEM privileges. It also checks for Kaspersky and adjusts accordingly. The malicious payload is a Cobalt Strike beacon.

Now, the question is about whether InstallUtil.exe is used after creating a scheduled task to bypass SmartScreen and AppLocker. From the outline, the Execution step mentions that the WScript Shell creates a legitimate tool for installing .NET files to bypass SmartScreen and AppLocker. So, the tool is part of the execution process, not necessarily using InstallUtil.exe.

InstallUtil.exe is a known tool by Microsoft that's used for installing .NET applications. Attackers might use it to bypass certain security mechanisms, but in this case, the outline specifically talks about a .NET tool, not InstallUtil.exe. So, the answer is likely "No" because the bypass is done through a different method, not InstallUtil.exe.
</think>

The CTI outline describes a scenario where a .NET tool is used to bypass SmartScreen and AppLocker, not InstallUtil.exe. Therefore, the malware doesn't employ InstallUtil.exe for this purpose.

Final Answer: B: No
