Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the XAgent app, after executing on an iOS 7 device, will collect a list of processes before sending the data via HTTP to the C2 server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. The outline talks about Operation Pawn Storm, specifically focusing on an iOS malware similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows. The malware is installed on compromised systems, and it's active on both iOS 7 and 8, but with different behaviors on each. On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and runs in the background, restarting when terminated. On iOS 8, the icon isn't hidden, and it doesn't restart automatically, suggesting it was designed before iOS 8 was released in 2014.

Looking at the Command and Control section, the app sends data via HTTP using POST and GET requests. The logs are in HTML with colorsâ€”red for errors and green for others. The C&C URI is generated randomly with a base URI and parameters, and a token is used to identify modules, which is Base64 encoded with a random prefix. It can also upload files via FTP.

The question is whether, after hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7, the app will collect a list of processes before sending data. So, I need to see if the CTI outline mentions anything about process discovery.

The outline doesn't explicitly state that the app collects process information. It does mention that the app sends information via HTTP, but it doesn't specify what exactly is being sent. However, since it's similar to SEDNIT malware, which is known for process discovery, it's likely that XAgent does the same.

So, considering the behavior of similar malware and the fact that the app is designed to send data, it's probable that the app collects process data before sending it via HTTP. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The XAgent app, after executing on iOS 7, is likely to collect a list of processes before sending data via HTTP to the C2 server, similar to its behavior in other malware like SEDNIT.
