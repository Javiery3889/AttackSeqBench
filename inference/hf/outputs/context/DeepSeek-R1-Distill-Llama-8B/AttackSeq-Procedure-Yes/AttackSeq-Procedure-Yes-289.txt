Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor would iterate through password stores and steal Google Chrome credentials after evading defenses by using encoded blobs in PowerShell. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. The attacker is Dropping Elephant, also known as Chinastrats and Patchwork. They target high-profile entities, using spear-phishing and watering hole attacks. The initial access is through spear-phishing emails with documents that trigger a 'ping' to their server. Then, another email with an MS Word or PowerPoint document exploit is sent. They also use watering hole attacks where a website downloads a document that's malicious.

Looking at the execution phase, the backdoor used is UPX packed and downloads more malware from a C2 server. These downloads are encoded blobs that are decoded into PowerShell scripts. This method helps in evading detection because the scripts aren't easily identifiable as malicious until executed.

In the collection phase, the file-stealer module goes through directories to collect files with specific extensions like doc, docx, etc., and uploads them to the C2 server. So, they're gathering various files, which could include sensitive information.

The command and control part mentions that the backdoor pings the C2 server regularly, which can be detected via firewall logs, and they use encrypted C2s hidden in comments on legitimate sites.

Now, the question is whether, after evading defenses by using encoded blobs, the backdoor would iterate through password stores to steal Google Chrome credentials. The options are Yes or No.

From the CTI outline, the backdoor's main function after initial access is to download more malware via encoded blobs. The collection phase involves file-stealing, but it's not explicitly stated whether this includes password stores or specifically Chrome credentials.

I know that password stores often contain credentials for various applications, including browsers like Chrome. However, the CTI outline doesn't mention anything about the backdoor or file-stealer targeting password stores. It focuses on file collection, not specifically credentials.

So, while the backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection and download more malware, there's no direct indication that it would target password stores. The file-stealer grabs files with certain extensions, but without explicit mention of password files, it's unclear if Chrome credentials are stolen this way.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's not specified that the backdoor would iterate through password stores for Chrome credentials. So the answer is No.
</think>

The CTI outline describes that Dropping Elephant uses encoded blobs in PowerShell to download additional malware, which helps evade detection. The file-stealer module collects various file types, but there's no mention of targeting password stores or stealing Chrome credentials. Without explicit indication, it's unlikely the backdoor would specifically target password stores for Chrome. 

Final Answer: B: No
