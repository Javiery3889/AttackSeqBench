Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gamaredon's malware will search for sensitive documents after they inject malicious macros into Word and Excel files. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The initial access is through spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. Then, during execution, they use scripts like Batch and VBScript, and rundll32 to drop backdoors. For persistence, they use scheduled tasks, registry keys, and macros in documents.

In the lateral movement phase, it says they inject malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents accessible on compromised systems. They use Outlook VBA macros to send more emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. So, after compromising one system, they spread the infection laterally by attaching malicious files to emails sent from the infected system.

Now, the question is about whether, after this injection, the malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase. The CTI outline mentions that during discovery, the backdoors list interesting files like Office documents for future exfiltration. So, once the backdoor is established, it automatically lists files that could be exfiltrated later.

Putting this together, after injecting macros, the malware would likely use the backdoor to collect and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Therefore, it's likely that they do search for these files during the collection phase.

The CTI outline indicates that Gamaredon's malware injects malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for lateral movement. These macros are used to send more emails, which suggests the malware is designed to spread further. Additionally, the backdoor automatically lists files for exfiltration, implying that after initial compromise, the malware actively seeks out and collects sensitive documents. Therefore, it's likely that the malware does search for these files during the collection phase.

Final Answer: A: Yes
