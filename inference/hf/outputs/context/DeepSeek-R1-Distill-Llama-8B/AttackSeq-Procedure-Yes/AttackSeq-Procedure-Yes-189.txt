Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from local systems based on file extensions during the discovery phase. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the behavior of the Infamous Chisel malware. It's associated with Sandworm activity and has several components like dropbear, scp, nmap, etc. The netd component is a key part here.

In the Execution section, it says that Chisel replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, giving it root privileges. So, netd is a critical component for the malware's operation.

Moving on to the Persistence section, netd is replaced and checks if it's run by init. This ensures it runs as root, which is important for maintaining access.

For Privilege Escalation, it's mentioned that netd is executed as root, which means it can perform actions with high privileges.

In the Credential Access section, the malware scrapes files containing credentials and key info. It also deploys tcpdump to sniff network traffic. This suggests it's gathering a lot of data from the system.

Discovery is where the focus is. The netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS info, lists installed packages, and gathers system info like Android ID and hardware details. It also does IP scanning on the local network. So, during discovery, it's gathering various system files and information.

The question is about whether, after enumerating directories and gathering info, the netd component automatically collects files based on extensions. The CTI outline doesn't explicitly say that netd uses file extensions for collection. Instead, it mentions that netd collects files of interest, but it doesn't specify the criteria, like extensions. It just says it collects files and system info.

So, the key point is that while netd does collect files, there's no mention of using file extensions as a criterion. The outline talks about directory enumeration and data collection but doesn't specify that it's based on file extensions. Therefore, the answer would be that it's not specified whether it uses extensions, but the outline doesn't mention it, so the answer is No.
</think>

The CTI outline does not explicitly state that the netd component uses file extensions to collect files. It only mentions that it collects files of interest and system information without specifying the criteria, such as file extensions. Therefore, it's not confirmed that it automatically collects files based on extensions.

Final Answer: B: No
