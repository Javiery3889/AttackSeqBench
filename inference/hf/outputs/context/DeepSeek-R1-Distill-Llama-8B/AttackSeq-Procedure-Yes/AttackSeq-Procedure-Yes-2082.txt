Okay, so I need to figure out whether RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting them to its landing page. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It says that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising or by visiting compromised sites with injected exploit kit JavaScript. This is part of the Initial Access phase, which is the first step in the attack sequence. So, the initial method is malvertising, which is a drive-by compromise technique.

Next, the Execution phase mentions that after initial access, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure. This uses techniques like Command and Scripting Interpreter and Exploitation for Client Execution. So, the initial access is through malvertising, and then it moves to execution via a PowerShell script.

Looking at the Command and Control section, RIG EK uses proxy servers and a reverse proxy setup to make infections harder to detect. It also has an API server that serves the exploit through the proxy, which detects the user's browser and returns the exploit code encrypted with RC4. This shows that the delivery method is likely through the initial access vector mentioned earlier.

The Others section adds more context: RIG EK has been active since 2014, using malvertising to distribute malware like Dridex and RaccoonStealer. It targets outdated IE browsers and has a high success rate, especially on certain days. This reinforces that malvertising is a primary method of initial access.

Now, the question is about whether RIG EK delivers exploits via malvertising before redirecting to its landing page. From the outline, the initial access is through malvertising, which is a drive-by compromise. This means that the user is redirected to a malicious page (advertising or compromised site) which then executes the exploit. After that, the exploit runs, leading to further stages like the PowerShell script execution.

So, the sequence is: malvertising redirects the user to an exploit, which then leads to the RIG EK's landing page or further stages. Therefore, the answer should be yes, RIG EK does use malvertising to redirect users before moving to its landing page.

The analysis indicates that RIG EK initiates its attack by delivering exploits through malvertising, which redirects users to malicious pages before proceeding to its landing page. This aligns with the initial access method described in the CTI outline.

Final Answer: A: Yes
