Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Derusbi malware uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscated communication and sends HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp after gathering system information. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes a cyber attack that starts with initial access via SSH, then execution of Derusbi malware, which drops a kernel module called Turbo. This module provides persistence by hiding processes and modifies the system's process ID table. It also uses cloaking and anti-analysis techniques, like modifying the system call table and disabling write protection on the CPU's control register.

Next, during the discovery phase, Derusbi collects system information, like hostname and GCC version, and sends this data back to the command and control (C2) infrastructure via network beacons. The question is about whether this data transmission uses HTTP beaconing with obfuscation and specifically targets the URL /photos/photo.asp using HTTP POST requests.

From the outline, it's mentioned that Derusbi sends data via network beacons. Beaconing typically refers to periodic data transmission to a C2 server, often over HTTP or HTTPS. The fact that it's using port 443 suggests HTTPS, as that's the standard HTTPS port. However, the question is about HTTP beaconing, which is less common but possible.

The key point is whether the communication is obfuscated. The outline doesn't explicitly mention obfuscation techniques. It does talk about cloaking and anti-analysis, but that's more about hiding processes and avoiding detection, not about communication encryption or obfuscation during data transmission. So, while the use of port 443 implies HTTPS, there's no direct mention of obfuscation.

Now, looking at the URL /photos/photo.asp, the outline doesn't specify where the data is sent. It just says the data is sent via beacons. Without specific information about the endpoint URL, I can't confirm if it's /photos/photo.asp. However, the question is about whether it's likely, given the context.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Since the outline doesn't mention obfuscation, I lean towards No. Also, the specific endpoint isn't detailed, so it's uncertain if it's /photos/photo.asp. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: No.

The CTI outline indicates that Derusbi sends system information via network beacons using port 443, which suggests HTTPS, but doesn't mention obfuscation or a specific endpoint like /photos/photo.asp. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: B
