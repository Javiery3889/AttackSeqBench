Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether PurpleFox will install a rootkit driver to hide its files and processes and also execute a .vbs script to block ports 135, 139, and 445 after ensuring persistence by replacing sens.dll. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that PurpleFox uses an MSI package for persistence. The MSI installs components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory and modifies the registry to replace sens.dll with their malicious version. This makes the backdoor run as a System Event Notification Service (SENS), which is a legitimate Windows service, so it's less likely to be detected.

Now, the question is about what PurpleFox does next. The options are whether they install a rootkit driver to hide their files and processes and also block specific ports using a .vbs script.

Looking at the Execution phase, PurpleFox uses PowerSploit to load an exploit and the Tater module to run the MSI. After that, the Persistence phase is handled by the MSI, which sets up the backdoor. There's no mention in the outline of installing a rootkit driver or using a .vbs script to block ports.

The Others section mentions that the backdoor uses WebSockets for C&C and has capabilities like key negotiations and command execution. It also notes that Trend Micro's MDR detected suspicious PowerShell commands related to FoxSocket. However, there's no direct mention of using a rootkit or firewall rules post-persistence.

So, the outline doesn't specify that PurpleFox would use a rootkit or block ports after ensuring persistence. Therefore, the answer is likely "No."

The CTI outline does not mention PurpleFox installing a rootkit or using a .vbs script to block ports after ensuring persistence. The focus is on using the MSI for persistence and establishing a backdoor via WebSockets. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
