Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in question sends the collected data via HTTP and then uploads files via FTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It talks about an iOS malware called XAgent, which is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows. The malware is installed on compromised systems, and it's been around since before iOS 8 was released in 2014. 

Looking at the Execution part, the app is hidden on iOS 7 but not on iOS 8. It runs in the background and restarts when terminated. This suggests it's persistent and evasive, which is common in malware to avoid detection.

Now, the Discovery section lists what the app can do: collect text messages, contacts, geo-location, start voice recording, get installed apps, processes, and Wi-Fi status. So, it's gathering a lot of personal and sensitive data.

The question is about whether this data is sent via HTTP and then files via FTP. I know that HTTP is a common protocol for data transmission, often used for C2 (Command and Control) communication. FTP, on the other hand, is less secure and was more commonly used in the past, but it's still possible.

The CTI outline mentions that the malware is similar to SEDNIT, which I recall is associated with Russia and uses various protocols. SEDNIT uses both HTTP and FTP for communication, so it's plausible that XAgent does the same.

Putting it together, since the app collects data and the malware is similar to SEDNIT, it's likely that the data is first sent via HTTP and then files via FTP as part of its C2 operations. So the answer should be yes.

The malware in question, XAgent, is designed to collect various data types and is similar to SEDNIT malware, which uses both HTTP and FTP for communication. Given this, it's plausible that the data is transmitted via HTTP and files via FTP.

Final Answer: A: Yes
