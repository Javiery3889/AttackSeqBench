Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the encoded PowerShell script from a VBS macro in a phishing email will execute and download Ursnif and GandCrab malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The initial access was through phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros. These macros, when executed, delivered Ursnif and GandCrab malware. The documents had VBS macros that used the .Net Webclient class in PowerShell to download payloads from C2 servers without writing to the disk, which is a classic evasion technique.

The question is specifically about whether the PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and download these payloads. From the outline, it's clear that the VBS macro does execute PowerShell code. The script uses DownloadString and DownloadData methods to communicate with C2 servers, which then download the malicious payloads. Since the macro is designed to do this, it's likely that it will successfully execute and fetch the malware.

I don't see any information in the outline that suggests the script wouldn't execute or that there's any defense mechanism preventing it from doing so. The focus is on how it evades detection by not writing to the disk, but the functionality of retrieving and executing the payloads is present.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, the script will execute and download the malware.

The phishing email's VBS macro executes PowerShell code that communicates with C2 servers to download Ursnif and GandCrab. Since the script is designed to do this without writing to disk, it's likely to succeed.

Final Answer: A: Yes
