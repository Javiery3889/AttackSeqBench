Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether QuasarRAT communicates with a C2 server using AES-128 encryption based on the CTI outline provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline to understand how QuasarRAT operates. The outline mentions that QuasarRAT is a backdoor used by the MenuPass threat actor. It arrives as a 64-bit service DLL using CppHostCLR to decrypt, load, and invoke a .NET assembly in memory. The assembly is obfuscated with ConfuserEx. The payload is stored in the Microsoft.NET directory and is encrypted. There are two versions mentioned: 2.0.0.0 and 1.3.0.0.

For persistence, QuasarRAT installs itself as a service called DILLJUICE in later variants. The payload is stored encrypted and decrypted in memory. The loader uses CppHostCLR and is obfuscated with ConfuserEx v1.0.0. Some loaders are signed with a certificate from CONVENTION DIGITAL LTD, countersigned by Symantec.

In terms of defense evasion, the use of multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption is clear. The initial loader injects and executes the .NET loader assembly, and the payload is stored under the Microsoft.NET directory. The .NET loader is obfuscated with ConfuserEx.

Now, the question is about whether QuasarRAT communicates with a C2 server using AES-128 encryption as specified in its configuration. The outline mentions that the threat actor added a custom connectivity check to the backdoor. It also says that if a valid URL is specified in the configuration, the malware will try to download the content of that URL and connect to the C2 server only once the download is successful. Additionally, YARA rules can identify QuasarRAT loaders and possible high-entropy payloads in the Microsoft.NET directory.

I don't see any specific mention of encryption protocols like AES-128 in the CTI outline. The focus is on obfuscation techniques like CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx, which are about how the code is hidden and loaded, not about communication encryption. The outline talks about the configuration having a URL, but it doesn't specify the encryption method used for C2 communication. It's possible that the configuration could include encryption, but the outline doesn't provide details on that.

So, the question is whether AES-128 is specified. Since the outline doesn't mention AES-128, I can't confirm that it's used. The threat actor might have used other encryption methods, or it might not have used any specific one. Without explicit information, it's safer to say that it's not specified, so the answer would be No.
</think>

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of AES-128 encryption for C2 communication. It focuses on obfuscation techniques but doesn't specify encryption protocols. Therefore, it's not confirmed that QuasarRAT uses AES-128.

Final Answer: B: No
