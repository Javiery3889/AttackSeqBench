Okay, so I need to figure out whether FIN4 uses C2 servers for collecting credentials and relies on Tor for command and control. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the outline says that FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with VBA macros to get Outlook credentials. These credentials are sent to their C2 servers. So, yes, they definitely use C2 servers for collecting the stolen info.

Now, the question is about whether they rely on Tor for command and control. The outline mentions that they have over 70 campaign codes and use C2 servers, but I don't see any mention of Tor. Tor is typically used for anonymity, but the outline doesn't specify that they use it. So, I think the answer is no.

The CTI outline clearly states that FIN4 transmits stolen credentials to their C2 servers but does not mention the use of Tor for command and control. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
