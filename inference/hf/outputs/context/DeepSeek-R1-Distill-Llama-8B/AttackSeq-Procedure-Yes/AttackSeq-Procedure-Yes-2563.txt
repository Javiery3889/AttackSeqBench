Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Shellbot will establish C&C communication via an IRC channel after gathering information about the infected host. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attack starts with initial access where the Outlaw group uses Shellbot to compromise FTP servers. They then link these to a high-availability cluster to host an IRC bouncer for command and control. So, the IRC bouncer is set up as part of the initial access phase.

In the Execution phase, Shellbot is described as being distributed via command injection vulnerabilities on various devices, including Linux and Windows. It's also mentioned that the botnet was previously spread using Shellshock, but now it's mostly brute-forced or via compromised hosts. This tells me that the botnet is already being managed through IRC, as the initial access involved setting up an IRC bouncer.

Moving on to Persistence, the Shellbot communicates persistently with C&C servers via IRC. It's noted that even if the machine is restarted, the changes remain, which suggests that the IRC connection is maintained. So, once the bot is installed, it keeps the IRC channel open, possibly using PING/PONG to avoid disconnection.

In the Discovery phase, the bot gathers specific info about the infected host, like processor details and presence of monitoring tools. This step is part of the bot's operation, but the key point is that after gathering this info, the bot's next action is likely to establish or maintain communication with its C&C server. Since the bot is already set up to use IRC for persistence, it's logical that after gathering data, it would use that same method to send commands or receive further instructions.

The Others section mentions that the group uses these attacks for cybercrime, operates during business hours, and recommends security measures like monitoring CLI traffic and non-DNS monitoring. It also notes that Trend Micro's XGen can help. But the key point here is that the bot uses IRC for C&C, which is a known method in the initial access phase and is persistent.

So, putting it all together: The bot gathers info, then uses IRC to communicate with its C&C. Therefore, the answer should be yes.
</think>

The Shellbot, after gathering information about the infected host, is likely to establish C&C communication via IRC, as it's already set up for persistent communication through an IRC bouncer as part of the initial access and persistence phases.

Final Answer: A: Yes
