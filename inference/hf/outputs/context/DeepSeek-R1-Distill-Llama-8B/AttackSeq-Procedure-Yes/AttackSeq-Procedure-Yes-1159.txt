Okay, so I need to figure out whether the PROMETHIUM malware encodes the archives with an unusual scheme and splits them into chunks before sending them to the C2 server. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the outline says that during the Collection phase, PROMETHIUM searches for Microsoft Office files, compresses them into an archive, and then encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server. So, the key points here are that it compresses the files and then encodes them.

The question is asking if the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks. From the outline, it mentions that the malware compresses the files into an archive and then encodes it. Now, the term "unusual scheme" makes me think about how the encoding is done. Typically, encoding could be done with a standard method like AES encryption, which is common. But the outline doesn't specify any unusual scheme beyond the fact that it's encoded.

However, the outline does mention that the archives are split into chunks. Splitting into chunks is a common way to handle large files for transmission, especially over the internet, to avoid issues with size limits or network constraints. So, the malware splits the archive into smaller chunks, which is a standard practice to manage large data transmission.

Wait, but the question is about both the encoding scheme and splitting into chunks. The outline says it compresses and encodes, but doesn't specify the type of encoding scheme. So, if the scheme is unusual, that would be a yes. But the outline doesn't mention an unusual scheme, just that it's encoded. So maybe the unusual part is the splitting into chunks, which is a common practice, so that's not unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the encoding is done with a specific, less common method, but the outline doesn't specify. So, based on the information given, the malware does split the archives into chunks, but the encoding scheme isn't described as unusual. Therefore, the answer would be yes because it does split them, but the encoding part isn't necessarily unusual.

Wait, the question is whether it's likely that the malware will do both: encode with an unusual scheme and split into chunks. Since the outline says it compresses and encodes, but doesn't specify the scheme, but does mention splitting into chunks, the answer would be yes because it does split them, but the encoding scheme isn't specified as unusual. So, the correct answer is A: Yes.

The malware compresses and encodes the files, and the outline mentions splitting into chunks, which is a common practice. While the encoding scheme isn't specified as unusual, the splitting is confirmed. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
