Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware after establishing command and control using backdoor malware. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes a cyber attack on the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) by the Lazarus group. The attack involved several stages: Execution, Persistence, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control.

In the Execution phase, the attackers used a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) which established persistence by creating a registry key and placing itself in the C:\Windows\Temp directory. They also used a 'Polyglot' file, which is a ZIP file hidden within a bitmap image, and executed it as a TMP file. Additionally, they used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida to communicate with command and control servers.

Moving on to Persistence, the malware spread itself across the network using hardcoded user accounts and passwords, and it set up a registry key for automatic execution. This shows they wanted to ensure their malware runs on startup.

For Lateral Movement, the attackers used the same loader/spreader to copy themselves to other devices on the network, using a list of 5357 hardcoded IPs. They also used SMB shares with the credentials obtained from the initial infection to move laterally.

In the Command and Control section, the backdoor malware communicated with remote servers, taking commands from the C&C and executing them. The backdoor was designed to receive a command line parameter for the C&C address and port, then fetch tasks from there.

Now, the question is whether after establishing C2, they deployed Hermes ransomware. The CTI outline mentions that the attackers used backdoor malware to communicate with C&C and execute commands. It also talks about the Polyglot file and the use of Themida, but there's no direct mention of Hermes ransomware or any file encryption using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm or leaving ransom notes.

Hermes ransomware is known for encrypting files with a 2048-bit RSA key and appending .hermes or .key files, and leaving ransom notes. However, the CTI report doesn't specify any encryption activities beyond the initial execution and C2 communication. The focus is on establishing persistence, lateral movement, and command execution, not on data encryption.

So, while the attackers used backdoor malware for C2, there's no evidence in the CTI outline that they used Hermes ransomware. Therefore, the answer is likely "No."
</think>

The CTI outline does not mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware, focusing instead on establishing command and control and lateral movement. There's no indication of file encryption with a 2048-bit RSA algorithm or ransom notes left by the attackers.

Final Answer: B: No
