Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware described in the CTI outline would perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before deleting its own indicators. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline talks about a malware system called netsat.exe, which infects removable media and collects data from infected drives. It mentions that the malware has components like netui3.dll and winmgt.dll. The malware operates by receiving commands from an encrypted file on the local system, which suggests a command and control (C2) mechanism. 

In the Execution section, it says that netsat.exe is the master program that infects removable media and collects data. The other components, netui3.dll and winmgt.dll, act as field units. They collect system information and files from connected systems and shared drives. So, these components are responsible for gathering detailed information.

Looking at the Discovery section, the malware collects a lot of data points, including IP addresses, system names, OS versions, drive details, network adapter descriptions, and recursive directory listings. This indicates that the malware is not only collecting files but also performing directory traversal to gather more information.

The Collection section mentions that the malware collects files, which might be obfuscated using a custom XOR operation. The exfiltration method isn't specified, but the data is presumably collected by the master system, implying that the master system might have a way to send the data out.

Now, the question is whether the malware would perform recursive directory listings and collect system details before cleaning up by deleting indicators of its presence. From the outline, during the Discovery phase, the malware does perform recursive directory listings. It collects detailed information, which includes system details. So, it's clear that the malware does collect these details.

The outline doesn't explicitly mention whether the malware deletes indicators after collection. However, the fact that it's a sophisticated malware suggests it would try to cover its tracks. Malware often does this to avoid detection. So, it's reasonable to infer that after collecting the necessary data, the malware would delete its own artifacts to prevent being detected.

Putting this together, the malware does perform recursive directory listings and collects system details as part of its operation. It's also likely that it would clean up by deleting indicators of its presence. Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."
</think>

The malware described in the CTI outline collects system details through recursive directory listings and is likely to delete its indicators afterward. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Discovery Phase:** The malware collects detailed information, including recursive directory listings.
2. **Malware Sophistication:** Sophisticated malware often includes cleanup to avoid detection.
3. **Inference:** The outline suggests the malware collects data and is likely to delete indicators post-operation.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
