Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether TG1021, the threat actor, demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation. 

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the Initial Access, TG1021 exploited IIS servers using deserialization attacks. That's the first step. Then, they executed a memory-resident malware called something, which I think is the second step. 

Next, for Persistence, the outline says they used web shells and a custom malware framework called NodeIISWeb. This malware intercepts HTTP requests and operates in memory. Importantly, it mentions that after using these tools, they removed all disk-resident tools. So, this seems like a clear effort to clean up and avoid leaving traces on the disk, which would help in evading detection.

Moving on to Privilege Escalation, they used a custom version of PotatoEx.dll, which is a local privilege escalation tool. This is the specific action mentioned in the question. After this, the outline doesn't mention any additional steps for persistence beyond what was already done with the web shells and NodeIISWeb framework. So, the focus here is on using the Potato tools for escalation but then removing tools to avoid detection.

The question is whether this removal of disk-resident tools is a significant effort to avoid detection. From the outline, yes, they did remove these tools after using them. That's a clear indicator of defense evasion. So, the answer should be yes, they made an effort to avoid detection by removing tools.

The CTI outline explicitly states that TG1021 removed disk-resident tools after using them, indicating a deliberate effort to avoid detection. This aligns with the question, so the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A: Yes
