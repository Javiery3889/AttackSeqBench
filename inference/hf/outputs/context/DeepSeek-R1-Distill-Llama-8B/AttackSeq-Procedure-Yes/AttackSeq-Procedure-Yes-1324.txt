Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the outline describes how CosmicDuke operates. It starts with initial access, where it uses a PDF with a Flash exploit to get into the system. Then, during execution, it uses a loader to drop malware. The persistence mechanism involves creating scheduled tasks and services to keep itself running.

Looking at credential access, it mentions that CosmicDuke targets various software like Skype, Google Chrome, and others to steal credentials. It also steals Windows credentials, including LM and NT hashes, cached passwords, LSA secrets, and WLAN keys. Additionally, it exports certificates and private keys using a password 'saribas'. So, it's clear that it's gathering a lot of information from the system.

Now, the question is about whether it uses keyloggers, screenshotters, and clipboard stealers. The outline doesn't explicitly mention keyloggers or screenshotting tools. It does mention that it searches for files and non-English filenames related to encryption, but that's more about data collection through file searching rather than active monitoring.

However, the credential access part does include stealing credentials, which could be done through keyloggers, but the outline doesn't specify that. It also mentions exfiltration via FTP, so it's about data collection and sending it out.

Since the outline doesn't explicitly state the use of keyloggers or screenshotters, but it does focus on stealing credentials and data through file searching and exfiltration, I'm leaning towards it not using those tools. It's more about direct data collection rather than actively monitoring user activity.

The CTI outline does not explicitly mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. It focuses on stealing credentials and exfiltrating data through file searching and FTP. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that CosmicDuke does not use these tools.

Final Answer: B: No
