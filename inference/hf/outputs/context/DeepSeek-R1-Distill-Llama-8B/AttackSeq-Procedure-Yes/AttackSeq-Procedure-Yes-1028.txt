Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gamaredon will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents after using their Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let's go through each part.

Initial Access: Gamaredon uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. They abuse compromised email accounts to send these to the victim's contacts. So, they start by getting initial access through phishing.

Execution: They use scripting like Batch files and VBScript, and use rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, which are backdoors. They also use CreateProcess to run payloads from C&C servers and rely on users executing email attachments for initial compromise. So, after the initial phishing email, they execute malicious scripts to gain a foothold.

Persistence: They register modules as scheduled tasks, use Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder. They also insert malicious macros into documents so they reopen with persistence. So, they make sure their malware stays on the system.

Defense Evasion: They use obfuscated files, modify registry keys to disable security mechanisms in Office, use code signing with valid certificates, deobfuscate and decrypt strings, and add remote templates to documents. They also have a C# compiler module that's obfuscated and uses csc.exe to compile and execute. So, they try to avoid detection.

Discovery: Their backdoors list interesting files, like Office documents, for future exfiltration. So, once they have access, they look for files to exfiltrate.

Lateral Movement: They inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system and use Outlook VBA macros to send more emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. So, after initial access, they move laterally by sending more emails.

Command and Control: Uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.

Exfiltration: Uploads harvested documents to C&C servers.

Others: They've been active since 2013, targeting Ukrainian institutions, using various tools, not very stealthy, focus on quick data exfiltration. They use many domains for C&C, change them often, and use separate domains for different groups. They install multiple scripts and executables, making it hard for defenders.

Now, the question is about whether after using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement, they deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents. 

Looking at the CTI outline, under the "Discovery" section, it says their backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration. So, they do have a process where they identify files to exfiltrate, which suggests they might scan for sensitive documents.

In the "Exfiltration" section, they upload harvested documents to C&C, which implies they collect data. So, after gaining access, they look for files to take and send back.

In the "Lateral Movement" section, they inject macros into documents and send more emails, which could be part of their collection process. But the question is about deploying scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents. 

In the "Others" section, it's mentioned they use various tools to gather sensitive info and spread further. So, they might have scripts that automatically scan for specific types of files or data.

Putting it together, after using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement, it's likely they would deploy scripts to scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities. So, the answer should be "Yes".

The analysis indicates that Gamaredon's tactics include using Outlook VBA macros for lateral movement and then employing scripts to identify and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Therefore, it's likely they deploy scripts to automatically scan for such data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
