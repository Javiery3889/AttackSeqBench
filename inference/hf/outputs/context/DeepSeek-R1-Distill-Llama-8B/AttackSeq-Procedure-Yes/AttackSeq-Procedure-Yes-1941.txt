Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Smooth Operator malware will exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after establishing communication with its C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence, which is based on MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The malware is called Smooth Operator and targets macOS via a supply chain attack on 3CX software. The initial access is through a malicious dylib in the 3CX package, which is signed and notarized by Apple, making it look legitimate.

Looking at the Execution section, the malware runs as part of the 3CX software without affecting its normal use. It creates a new thread and uses a constructor function in the dylib to initiate. So, it's pretty stealthy in how it operates.

Next, Persistence is handled by abusing a legitimate component, ensuring it runs every time libffmpeg.dylib is loaded. That means once it's on the system, it's there to stay, which is a common tactic to ensure long-term access.

For Defense Evasion, the second-stage payload, called UpdateAgent, is mentioned. It daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process, which helps in evading detection. It also deletes itself from the disk right after execution, which is a way to avoid being found. Additionally, it writes to the legitimate 3CX directory, making it look like a normal part of the system. The C2 traffic is obfuscated with a custom algorithm, so even if someone is monitoring, it's hard to tell what's going on.

Moving on to Discovery, the malware collects information from the victim machine. It gathers the OS version from SystemVersion.plist and domain and account names from config.json. This data is included in beacons or exfiltration. So, the data collection is done before any exfiltration.

In the Collection section, it's clear that the malware stages data to be included in beacons or exfiltration. It extracts OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index, which are sent in every beacon. The UpdateAgent also extracts domain and account names from config.json for exfiltration. So, the data is both collected and then sent back to the C2 servers.

Command and Control is handled by HTTPS communication with multiple C2 servers. Each beacon uses a new server randomly, and if one doesn't work, it tries another. The data is obfuscated, which adds another layer of stealth.

Now, the question is whether the malware will exfiltrate data via a HTTP GET request after establishing C2 communication. The CTI outline mentions that the UpdateAgent is the second-stage payload, which parses and extracts data from config.json for exfiltration. It also says that the data collected is included in beacons or exfiltration. The UpdateAgent uses a HTTP GET request for C2 communication, but the question is about exfiltration.

Wait, the outline says that the UpdateAgent is lightweight and meant to determine which victims to pursue further stages. It also mentions that the second-stage payload is meant for exfiltration. So, the UpdateAgent is the one that does the data extraction and sends it via HTTP GET. Therefore, after establishing C2 communication, the UpdateAgent would exfiltrate data using HTTP GET.

So, the answer should be Yes, it's likely that the malware will exfiltrate data via HTTP GET.

The malware uses the UpdateAgent, which communicates via HTTPS and HTTP GET to send exfiltrated data. The CTI outline confirms that the UpdateAgent is responsible for exfiltration, making the answer Yes.

Final Answer: A
