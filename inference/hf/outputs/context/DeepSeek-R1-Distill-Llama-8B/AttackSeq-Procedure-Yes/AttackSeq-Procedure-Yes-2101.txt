Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the backdoor installed by the attackers will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltrating data. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the initial access was through spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents. These documents used the remote template technique to get the next stage from the attacker's server. So, the attackers are using a phishing tactic to get their foot in the door.

Next, during execution, they used Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a backdoor. They used RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities. This led to a multi-stage infection, ending with malicious code execution. So, the backdoor is installed, which is a big step in maintaining control over the system.

For persistence, the attackers set up a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to run a DLL called '5.t' with rundll32.exe once a day. This helps them maintain their foothold, ensuring the backdoor stays active.

Looking at defense evasion, the loader used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques. It gathered data on the victim's computer, encrypted it, and sent it to the C&C server. They also used dynamic API resolving to hide their activities, making it harder to detect.

In the discovery phase, the backdoor gathered a lot of system information, like hostname, OS details, user info, and network data. This helps them assess the value of the compromised machine.

Collection involved the backdoor's ability to collect various data types, such as files, processes, services, screenshots, network info, registry keys, etc. This is crucial for their surveillance.

Command and Control: The backdoor communicates with a C&C server using encrypted messages. It sends a 'Start conversation' and receives a 'Get Victim Information' message. The communication uses XORed data with a 256-byte key, so it's secure but not perfect.

Exfiltration: Data like screenshots, files, and system info are sent back via the C&C channel. Now, the question is whether the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer after exfiltration to disrupt operations.

Looking at the Others section, the attackers are a Chinese APT group with a history of refining their tools. Their infrastructure includes C&C servers in Asia and a backdoor C&C on Zenlayer. They've been using RoyalRoad and other tools, which gives context about their tactics.

So, the key points are that the backdoor is used for data collection and exfiltration. The question is about whether the backdoor will shut down the computer. From the outline, the backdoor's main functions are to gather data, communicate with C&C, and exfiltrate data. There's no mention of actions like shutting down the system. The persistence mechanism is a scheduled task, but that's for maintaining the backdoor's presence, not disrupting operations.

The attackers' focus seems to be on surveillance and data collection, not on causing immediate disruption. They might be more interested in gathering intel rather than causing system downtime. So, it's unlikely they would shut down the computer after exfiltration. They probably want the system to remain operational to continue gathering data without being noticed.

The backdoor's primary functions include data collection and exfiltration, not system disruption. There's no indication in the CTI outline that the attackers have the intent or capability to shut down the victim's computer. Their focus is on surveillance, so the most plausible answer is that the backdoor will not shut down the system.

Final Answer: B: No
