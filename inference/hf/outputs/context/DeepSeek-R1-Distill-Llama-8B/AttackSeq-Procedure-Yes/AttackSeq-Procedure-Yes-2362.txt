Okay, so I need to figure out whether the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and if the malware will use PowerShell for further execution after the FHAPPI campaign. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attack started with a phishing email that had a link to a Geocities website hosting VBScript malware. The VBScript was encoded, which probably means it was Base64 encoded to avoid detection. When the user clicked the link, the VBScript was downloaded and executed, which then opened a .doc file. This .doc file, I assume, is where the real action happened because it led to a PowerShell attack.

The outline mentions that the attack was fileless, which usually means it's using something like PowerShell to execute malicious code without writing to disk, making it harder to detect. So, after the VBScript runs, it's likely that it triggers a PowerShell command to execute the actual payload, which is Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy is a well-known malware that can do things like keylogging, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.

The VBScript being encoded in Base64 makes sense because Base64 is a common encoding method used to hide malicious code. So when the VBScript is decoded, it probably contains commands that are then executed via PowerShell. The fact that the attack was fileless and used multiple encodings supports the idea that it's using PowerShell for execution.

Also, the CTI outline mentions that the attack was linked to a larger campaign and was recognized in Japan, which might mean that the attackers are using techniques that are known to be effective in that region or against certain targets.

Putting it all together, the VBScript would decode and execute, leading to a PowerShell command that runs the malicious code. Since the attack was fileless and used Base64 encoding, it's highly probable that PowerShell was used for further execution. So the answer should be yes.
</think>

The FHAPPI campaign used a VBScript encoded with Base64, which, when executed, led to the download of a .doc file. This file likely triggered a PowerShell command to execute the Poison Ivy malware, a fileless attack method. Given the use of Base64 encoding and the fileless nature of the attack, it's highly likely that PowerShell was used for further execution.

Final Answer: A: Yes
