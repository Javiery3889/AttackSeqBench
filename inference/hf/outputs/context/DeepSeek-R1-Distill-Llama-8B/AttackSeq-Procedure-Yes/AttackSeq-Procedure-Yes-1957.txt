Okay, so I need to figure out whether the StellarParticle campaign, associated with COZY BEAR, would use credential hopping and delegated admin rights for persistence after gaining initial access via SSH and RDP, and then evade defenses by stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that StellarParticle uses various initial access techniques. They start by logging into a public-facing system via SSH using a local account they stole. They also use port forwarding to establish RDP sessions with different domain accounts. So, they have multiple ways to get into the network.

Next, looking at defense evasion, they use techniques like stealing browser cookies to bypass MFA. That makes sense because MFA often relies on cookies or other session data. They also rename their systems to match the victim's naming convention, which could help them avoid detection.

Now, for credential access, they use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP. They also use compromised service principals to make changes in Office 365 and access data from information repositories. So, they have a mix of different access levels.

In the lateral movement section, they use both types of accounts for RDP, which suggests they can move around the network using various credentials. They also use tools like AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets to gather info from Active Directory and other systems.

The question is about whether they use credential hopping and delegated admin rights for persistence after initial access. Credential hopping typically involves moving from one set of credentials to another, often using stolen credentials or those obtained through previous access. Delegated admin rights would allow them to access resources they don't have direct access to by using the permissions of another user, like a domain admin.

Looking at the CTI outline, they do use both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP. This indicates they might have access to higher-level permissions, possibly through credential access techniques. They also accessed information repositories, which could involve moving laterally and using different accounts.

They also used stolen browser cookies to bypass MFA, which is a form of defense evasion. So, after initial access, they'd likely try to maintain access by moving to higher privilege levels. Credential hopping would help them do that, and using delegated admin rights would allow them to persist by making changes that give them ongoing access.

Putting it all together, yes, it's likely they'd use credential hopping and delegated admin rights after initial access to maintain persistence and bypass MFA by stealing cookies.

The StellarParticle campaign, after gaining initial access via SSH and RDP, is likely to use credential hopping and delegated admin rights to persist and evade defenses. They use stolen browser cookies to bypass MFA, which aligns with their defense evasion tactics. Their use of both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP and accessing information repositories suggests a strategy to escalate privileges, making credential hopping and delegated admin rights plausible for persistence.

Final Answer: A: Yes
