Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether cybercriminals would use Shodan and Censys to find outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting MQTT in medical networks. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the CTI outline mentions that Shodan and Censys are tools used for discovering publicly available resources. Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices, and Censys helps identify exposed IoT devices. So, using these tools, one could find various services on medical network perimeters, like outdated Building Management systems and printers with unprotected web interfaces. Additionally, there are medical devices such as spirometers or blood pressure monitors that use MQTT, which is a protocol for IoT devices communication. These devices are discoverable online, posing a risk of unauthorized access and control.

The question is whether, after using Shodan and Censys, cybercriminals would likely find these outdated systems or devices. The answer choices are Yes or No.

Looking at the CTI outline, it's clear that the report discusses the use of these tools to discover such resources. The outline also mentions that these tools would help identify devices that could be vulnerabilities, like outdated systems and those supporting MQTT. The Others section adds context about the high malware rate in medical organizations and the targeting by APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike, indicating interest in data exfiltration, especially intellectual property or business plans.

So, the process would be: use Shodan and Censys to find exposed devices, identify outdated systems and MQTT-supported devices, which are then exploited. Therefore, it's highly likely that cybercriminals would find these targets after using these tools.

The analysis indicates that using Shodan and Censys would indeed help discover outdated Building Management systems and MQTT-supported medical devices, making it likely that cybercriminals would find these targets.

Final Answer: A: Yes
