Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the malware in this case will connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org during command and control communication after using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and evade defenses. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The attack started with an initial access phase where Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119). They embedded this exploit on a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) website. This was done to target visitors interested in a specific legal case between the Philippines and China.

Next, the execution phase involved the deployment of a malware payload called Rdws.exe, which is a dropper executable. This dropper used a DLL sideloading technique. It used a legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll). This DLL then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat). So, the malware was loaded through a legitimate process, which is a classic sideloading technique to bypass some security defenses.

Looking at the defense evasion part, the attackers used the same sideloading technique to deploy the malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program. This helps in evading detection because the system thinks it's a legitimate process. The malware then connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

Now, the question is whether the malware will connect back to pic.nicklockluckydog.org during command and control communication. The CTI outline mentions that the exploit domain used was registered with falsified information, which suggests it's a domain under the attackers' control. The malware, after being deployed, typically would need to communicate back to its command and control (C2) servers to receive further instructions or exfiltrate data.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Based on the information, the attackers used the domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org for the exploit, and the malware was designed to connect back to their infrastructure. Since the domain is part of their infrastructure, it's logical that the malware would use this domain for C2 communication. Therefore, the correct answer should be A: Yes.

The malware, after deploying via sideloading, is likely to connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog.org for command and control.

Final Answer: A
