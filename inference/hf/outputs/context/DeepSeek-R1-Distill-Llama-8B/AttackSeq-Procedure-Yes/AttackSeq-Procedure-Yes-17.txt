Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Machete malware, after establishing persistence, will log keystrokes, capture audio, and hijack the clipboard. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that Machete creates a file called 'Java Update.lnk' which points to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe' and installs itself into 'appdata/MicroDes/'. So, the first part of the attack is about persistence, which means the malware is ensuring it stays on the system after reboots or shutdowns.

Next, the Collection section details what Machete can do. It says it can log keystrokes, capture audio from the microphone, take screenshots, get geolocation data, take webcam photos, copy files to a remote server or a USB, and hijack the clipboard. So, the collection capabilities are extensive.

The question is asking if, after establishing persistence, Machete will perform these three specific actions: log keystrokes, capture audio, and hijack the clipboard. From the outline, I see that all three are listed under the Collection section. There's no indication that these actions are optional or conditional; they seem to be part of the malware's standard behavior.

I should also consider the context provided. The malware has been active since at least 2010 and 2012, targeting high-profile places like intelligence services and government institutions. This suggests it's a sophisticated tool, likely designed to gather as much data as possible to achieve its objectives, which would include sensitive information through keystroke logging, audio, and clipboard hijacking.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since all the mentioned actions are part of the Collection capabilities, the answer should be A.

The Machete malware, after establishing persistence, is designed to perform multiple collection actions, including logging keystrokes, capturing audio, and hijacking the clipboard. These actions are explicitly detailed in the CTI outline under the Collection section, indicating that all three are part of its standard behavior.

Final Answer: A
