Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' after using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor to communicate with C2 servers. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It describes the attack sequence used by Agrius. The outline mentions that Agrius starts by exploiting public-facing applications, specifically targeting FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and using SQL injection. This initial access allowed them to upload webshells for lateral movement via RDP.

Next, during execution, they deploy a .NET backdoor called 'IPsec Helper'. This backdoor is registered as a service for persistence, which means it's designed to keep running even after a system restart. The backdoor can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration from C2 servers. So, this is the key tool they're using for command and control.

Looking at the Command and Control section, the 'IPsec Helper' communicates over HTTP with C2 servers. It uses a configuration file with encrypted server addresses. The actions it can perform include updating relays, sending reconnaissance info, downloading files, and self-deletion. This shows that the backdoor is quite versatile and can handle various tasks as needed.

Now, the question is whether they then deploy wipers like 'Apostle' to destroy data. I know that wipers are ransomware that overwrite data, often causing data loss. The CTI outline doesn't explicitly mention the use of wipers. It does mention that the backdoor can download files, but it doesn't specify that these are wipers. The focus seems to be on initial access, lateral movement, and persistence through webshells and the backdoor.

The outline also talks about defense evasion techniques like obfuscation and self-deletion, but there's no mention of data destruction beyond what's necessary for their operations. Since the question is about deploying wipers, and the CTI doesn't mention this, I would lean towards the answer being 'No'. There's no indication in the provided information that Agrius used wipers in this attack.

The CTI outline does not mention the deployment of wipers like 'Apostle' or any ransomware. It focuses on initial access, lateral movement, and persistence through webshells and the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor. Without explicit evidence of wiper deployment, the answer is:

Final Answer: B: No
