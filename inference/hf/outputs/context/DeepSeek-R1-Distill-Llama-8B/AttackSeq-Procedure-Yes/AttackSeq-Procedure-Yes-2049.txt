Okay, so I need to figure out whether Charming Kitten impersonated well-known researchers or journalists to target non-Iranian researchers during the reconnaissance phase before redirecting them to decoy websites for initial access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that Charming Kitten's campaign involved fake websites impersonating various entities, including Google services like Gmail or Google Drive, and Instagram's official website. These were used to extract credentials and were hosted on BelCloud Hosting in Bulgaria. 

In the Initial Access section, it says the first stage was sending socially engineered emails from fake accounts impersonating known researchers or journalists, inviting victims to events. The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites. So, the initial phase was about reaching out to potential targets, likely using false identities to gain their trust.

The question is specifically about whether they targeted non-Iranian researchers during the reconnaissance phase before redirecting them to decoy sites for initial access. The outline mentions that the attackers used email trackers to monitor if their phishing emails were forwarded and collected geolocation and IP data. This suggests that the reconnaissance phase involved more than just the initial outreach; they were gathering information about the victims.

The 'Others' section attributes the campaign to Charming Kitten, noting that they targeted non-Iranian investigators whose expertise matched their TTPs. This indicates that the attackers were specifically going after individuals who were likely involved in cybersecurity or related fields, which fits with the use of researchers and journalists as initial targets.

Putting this together, the initial phase involved sending emails to non-Iranian researchers, which is part of the reconnaissance. Then, after that, they redirected them to decoy sites for initial access. So yes, they did use impersonation of researchers or journalists during the reconnaissance phase before moving to the next step.

The CTI outline clearly states that Charming Kitten's campaign began with sending socially engineered emails impersonating researchers or journalists as part of the initial access phase. These emails were part of the reconnaissance efforts to target non-Iranian researchers. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
