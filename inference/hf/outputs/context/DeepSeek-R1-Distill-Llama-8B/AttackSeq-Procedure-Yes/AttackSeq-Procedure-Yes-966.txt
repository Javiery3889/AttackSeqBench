Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Naikon APT group uses HTTP and TCP protocols during their Command and Control (C&C) stage after using the Aria-body backdoor for discovery. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the Naikon APT group's tactics, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Discovery, Collection, and others. 

In the Execution section, it mentions that the Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts config data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the backdoor. So, after execution, the backdoor is loaded, which is used for further activities.

During the Discovery phase, the backdoor gathers a lot of system information: hostname, computer name, username, etc. So, after gathering this data, the next step would logically be to send this information back to their C&C server. 

Looking at the Collection phase, the backdoor has several capabilities: create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate modules, gather file metadata, close sessions, collect OS info, and verify location. This suggests that the backdoor can send data back via some protocol. 

The question is about whether they use HTTP and TCP for sending data and listening for commands. The outline mentions that the C&C servers are used for collecting and relaying data, but it doesn't specify the protocol. However, given that modern C&C often uses protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for communication, especially if they're using something like GoDaddy for domain registration and Alibaba for hosting, which are common for setting up HTTP-based infrastructure.

Also, considering that the group uses fileless techniques and limited C&C server uptime, it's likely they're using standard protocols to avoid detection. HTTP is a common protocol for data transmission, and TCP is often used as the transport layer for such communications.

So, putting it together, after discovery, the backdoor would send the collected data via HTTP and TCP to the C&C server, and then listen for commands using the same or similar protocols.

The Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols during the Command and Control stage after discovery. These protocols are commonly used for data transmission and command handling in modern cyber operations, aligning with the described C&C activities.

Final Answer: A: Yes
