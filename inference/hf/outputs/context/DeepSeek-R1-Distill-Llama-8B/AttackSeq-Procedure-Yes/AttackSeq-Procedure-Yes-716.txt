Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the outline mentions that the Rising Sun implant is part of Operation Sharpshooter. The initial access phase involved distributing malicious documents with a macro that injects a downloader into the memory of Word. The macro then executes a second-stage implant called Rising Sun from a control server.

In the execution phase, the shellcode runs and uses functions like LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress to resolve libraries and APIs. It then downloads the second-stage payload and a decoy document. It uses CreateProcessA and ShellExecuteA to run these payloads. So, this part shows that the implant is actively downloading and executing files, which suggests it's communicating over a network.

Looking at the exfiltration phase, the Rising Sun implant encrypts data with RC4 and Base64, then sends it via HTTP POST requests to the control server. This directly mentions HTTP POST being used for communication.

The question is specifically about whether, after initial reconnaissance, the implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST. The initial reconnaissance is part of the discovery phase, where it gathers info from the registry. The exfiltration phase, which comes after, uses HTTP POST. So, after gathering info, the Rising Sun does send data via POST to the control servers.

So, the answer should be yes, it does communicate using HTTP POST after reconnaissance.

The Rising Sun implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests after initial reconnaissance. 

Final Answer: A: Yes
