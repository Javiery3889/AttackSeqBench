Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether RIG EK's exploit server uses a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. It mentions that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect. That's part of their defense evasion technique. Now, the question is about how they establish an encrypted connection for command and control.

I know that RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm commonly used in older protocols like SSL/TLS. It's known for being fast but not as secure as newer algorithms like AES. But the question is specifically about a custom version of RC4.

Looking at the outline, RIG EK is described as using known browser vulnerabilities and malvertising to deliver exploits. They run PowerShell scripts after initial access. They also use proxy servers for evasion. However, the outline doesn't explicitly mention the encryption method they use for C&C.

I don't see any specific mention of RC4 or any custom encryption in the outline. It talks about using proxy servers but not about the encryption protocols. So, while proxying is a method for evasion, there's no info on encryption algorithms.

The question is whether they use a custom RC4 version. Since the outline doesn't specify, I can't confirm that. But given that RIG EK is an exploit kit known for being active since 2014 and has evolved, it's possible they might use standard encryption methods. However, without explicit info, I can't say for sure.

Wait, but the question is about whether they use a custom RC4. Since the outline doesn't mention RC4 or any encryption, the answer is likely no. So the answer is B: No.
</think>

The CTI outline doesn't specify the encryption method RIG EK uses, so it's not mentioned whether they employ a custom RC4 algorithm. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that they don't use it.

Final Answer: B
