Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control (CnC) servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw after it uses a downloader to decrypt itself. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that Taidoor is a malware used in cyber espionage campaigns, often targeting government agencies, corporate entities, and think tanks, especially those related to Taiwan. The initial attack is via spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. When the attachment is opened, it exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware onto the system. There's also a decoy document to make the attack look legitimate.

In the Execution phase, the Taidoor malware communicates with a CnC server using an HTTP GET request that includes an encrypted MAC address of the compromised computer. So, the initial variant of Taidoor uses this method.

Now, the question is about a newer variant of Taidoor that's evolved to avoid detection. Specifically, this new variant uses a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts. This encrypted text is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware. Additionally, the network traffic pattern has changed to avoid detection.

The question is whether this new variant will communicate with the CnC servers mentioned: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.

Looking at the Others section, it's noted that Taidoor has been active since 2008 and has evolved, especially in 2011 and 2012. It's not an off-the-shelf malware and is associated with activities using it, and another malware family, Taleret, uses a similar technique for CnC communication. There's a connection between various activities using Taidoor and a similar naming scheme between Taidoor and Taleret.

So, the key points are:
- Taidoor communicates with CnC servers via HTTP GET requests with encrypted MAC addresses.
- The new variant uses a downloader from Yahoo Blogs to get encrypted text, which is decrypted into the malware.
- The network traffic has changed to avoid detection.

The question is about whether the new variant will use the same CnC servers as before. Since the original Taidoor used a specific CnC communication method, and the new variant's downloader is part of its evolution to avoid detection, it's likely that the new variant would still use similar CnC servers but with changes to evade detection.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Since the new variant is an evolution of Taidoor, it's probable that it maintains the same CnC communication method but with improved evasion techniques. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The new Taidoor variant, despite using a downloader to avoid detection, is likely to communicate with the same CnC servers as previous versions. This is because the evolution of the malware aims to evade detection rather than changing core communication methods. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer: A
