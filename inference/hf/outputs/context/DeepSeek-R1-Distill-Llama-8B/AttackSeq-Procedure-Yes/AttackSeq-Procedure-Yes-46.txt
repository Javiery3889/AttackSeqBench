Okay, so I need to figure out whether the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from an embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file. The CTI outline provided gives a detailed breakdown of the attack sequence, so I'll start by analyzing that.

First, the outline mentions that the campaign uses phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros. These macros are designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware. So, the initial step is the phishing email with the malicious document, which is the 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file as per the question.

Next, upon opening the document, a VBS macro is executed. The VBS macro calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script. This script then downloads and executes payloads for both Ursnif and GandCrab. So, the next step after the macro is the execution of this PowerShell script.

Looking at the question, it's asking if the campaign will execute the VBS macros after initial access. The answer choices are Yes or No. From the outline, it's clear that the VBS macro is triggered upon opening the document, so the answer should be Yes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Yes.

The campaign uses phishing emails with embedded macros that execute VBS scripts, which then download and execute malicious payloads. The question asks if the macros will execute after initial access, which aligns with the attack sequence described.

Final Answer: A: Yes
