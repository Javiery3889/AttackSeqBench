Okay, so I need to figure out whether the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine and attempt to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87.122:10001 before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the initial access was through malicious emails with an RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This RTF drops a PE file named svchost.exe, which is a downloader. So the first step is the execution of this downloader.

The CTI mentions that the MSIL/Crimson malware is modular and has a RAT component. The main RAT module is used to download additional payloads, which include keylogging and browser credential theft. It also says that infections happen in stages, with the first stage being the downloader component. So the initial execution is the downloader, which probably connects to its C&C server to fetch the full RAT.

The question is whether the malware will download the full RAT from 213.136.87.122:10001. The CTI doesn't specify the exact C&C server, but it does mention that the malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication. The outline also states that some modules rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration, which suggests that after the initial download, the RAT is activated.

Since the initial step is the downloader (svchost.exe), which is part of the MSIL/Crimson family, it's logical that this downloader would connect to its C&C server to receive further instructions or additional payloads. The RAT is a key component, and the CTI mentions that the RAT is used for data exfiltration, which implies that after the initial download, the RAT is activated to perform its functions.

Therefore, the sequence would be: RTF document drops svchost.exe (downloader), which connects to download the full RAT from the specified C&C server (213.136.87.122:10001), and then establishes command and control using the custom TCP protocol.
</think>

The MSIL/Crimson malware, after executing the initial RTF document, would use the svchost.exe downloader to connect to 213.136.87.122:10001 to fetch the full RAT component. This aligns with the described attack sequence, indicating that the answer is yes.

Final Answer: A
