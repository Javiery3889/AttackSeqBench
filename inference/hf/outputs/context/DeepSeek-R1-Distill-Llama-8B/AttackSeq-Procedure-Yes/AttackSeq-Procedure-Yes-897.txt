Okay, so I need to figure out whether the Office document delivered by KerrDown will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the system architecture. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline provided, I see that KerrDown is a downloader used by the OceanLotus group (APT32). It's delivered through two methods: Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros and RAR archives that use DLL side-loading. The RAR files have names in Vietnamese, suggesting targets are likely in Vietnam or speak Vietnamese.

The initial access method uses these documents to deliver KerrDown. So, the user is likely opening a document, which would trigger the macros. Now, the question is about whether the Office document contains an image file that tells the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the payload, depending on the system architecture.

From the outline, the KerrDown malware uses a VBS decode function to retrieve and execute the payload. The DLL is saved in a specific directory, and the payload (Cobalt Strike Beacon) is executed in memory without being written to the system. So, the payload is fetched via a URL based on the OS architecture.

I don't see any mention of an image file in the Office document instructing the victim to enable macros. The focus is more on the delivery method (macros and RAR) and the subsequent actions of KerrDown. The Others section talks about compile times and working hours but doesn't mention any image files or specific instructions within the document.

So, the question is whether the Office document includes such an image. Since the CTI outline doesn't mention this, it's unlikely. Therefore, the answer is No.

The CTI outline does not mention the inclusion of an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. The focus is on the delivery method (macros and RAR) and the subsequent actions of KerrDown, not on specific instructions within the document. Therefore, it's unlikely that the Office document contains such an image.

Final Answer: B: No
