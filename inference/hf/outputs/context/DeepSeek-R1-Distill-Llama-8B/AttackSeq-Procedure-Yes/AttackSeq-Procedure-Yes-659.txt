Okay, so I need to figure out whether Gallmaker would use living off the land (LotL) tactics and remove tools from the victim's machines after exploiting the DDE protocol. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that Gallmaker starts with a spear-phishing email delivering malicious Office documents. These documents use the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory, which means they don't leave artifacts on the disk. That's a common technique to avoid detection.

Next, after initial access, they execute various tools. They use WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts, a Metasploit reverse_tcp payload, a legitimate WinZip console for command execution and possibly data exfiltration, and the Rex PowerShell library. So, they're using legitimate tools for their malicious purposes, which is a living off the land technique because they're using existing, legitimate software to avoid detection.

The question is whether they would remove these tools after use. The CTI mentions that Gallmaker is likely using LotL tactics, which include using legitimate tools and services for malicious activities. This suggests they might avoid leaving behind tools that could be traced back to them. So, it makes sense that they would remove the tools they used, like the PowerShell scripts or the WinZip console, to prevent detection.

Also, the CTI notes that Symantec's TAA detected their activities, which implies that Gallmaker is evading detection by using these techniques. Therefore, removing tools would be part of their defense evasion strategy.

Looking at the answer choices, A is "Yes" and B is "No." Since the CTI mentions LotL and the need for defense evasion, the answer should be A.

Gallmaker uses legitimate tools like PowerShell and WinZip for their attacks, which is a living off the land (LotL) tactic. To avoid detection, they would likely remove these tools after use.

Final Answer: A
