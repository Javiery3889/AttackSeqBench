Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the PowerShell script used in this attack communicates with C2 servers to download Ursnif and GandCrab payloads. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The attack starts with reconnaissance via phishing emails with malicious Word documents. The initial access is through these documents, which have embedded macros. When the macro is executed, it triggers a VBS script that calls a shape box to run a PowerShell script. This script then downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

The defense evasion part mentions that the PowerShell script operates in memory, using the .Net Webclient class to download payloads. It also uses a specific DCOM object to execute the files without writing them to disk. So, the script is designed to avoid disk writes, which is a common evasion technique.

Now, the question is whether this script communicates with C2 servers. From the outline, the script uses the .Net Webclient to download payloads. Typically, when a script uses Webclient, it needs to send data over the internet, which would involve communication with a server. The fact that it's using Webclient suggests it's reaching out to some server to get the payloads.

Also, the script is associated with PS Empire, which is a tool used in attacks for launching malicious activities, including communication with C2 servers. PS Empire is known for its ability to interact with command and control servers, so it's likely that the script is doing the same.

Putting this together, the script needs to contact a server to download the malicious payloads. Since it's using Webclient and associated with tools that interact with C2s, the answer should be yes.

The PowerShell script uses the .Net Webclient to download payloads, which implies communication with a server. Given the association with PS Empire, a tool known for C2 interactions, the script likely communicates with C2 servers.

Final Answer: A: Yes
