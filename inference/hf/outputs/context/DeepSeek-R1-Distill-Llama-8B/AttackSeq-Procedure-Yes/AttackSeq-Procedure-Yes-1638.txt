Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether SUNSPOT malware will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor after monitoring MsBuild.exe. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that SUNSPOT is used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion products. The malware is designed to monitor processes involved in compiling the Orion product. Specifically, it looks for MsBuild.exe, which is part of Microsoft Visual Studio. So during the Discovery phase, the attacker uses MsBuild.exe to detect when the build process is running.

Now, the question is about whether this detection leads to modifying the source code. The outline mentions that SUNSPOT was designed to replace a source file with the backdoor code. So the process seems to be that once the malware detects the build process, it triggers the insertion of the backdoor.

Looking at the attack sequence, the steps are: Execution (dropping the malware), then Discovery (monitoring MsBuild.exe), and then Impact (modifying the source code). So after detecting the build process, the Impact phase would involve altering the code.

The answer choices are A: Yes and B: No. Since the outline clearly states that SUNSPOT is used to modify the source code upon detecting the build process, the answer should be Yes.

The SUNSPOT malware monitors MsBuild.exe to detect the build process, which is part of the Discovery tactic. Once detected, it modifies the source code to inject the backdoor, aligning with the Impact tactic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
