Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the attackers in the RevengeHotels campaign would collect credit card information from OTA websites after they've already infected a target environment with RAT malware like RevengeRAT. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, I know that the RevengeHotels campaign targets the hospitality sector, using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. These attachments, like Word, Excel, or PDF files, exploit CVE-2017-0199, which is a vulnerability. The emails are well-crafted with social engineering tactics, using typo-squatting domains to impersonate legitimate companies. Once the attachment is opened, it uses template injection to execute macro code, leading to the download of malware such as RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT, or ProCC.

Looking at the Execution section, the malware includes .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator, which when unpacked, reveal RATs like RevengeRAT. Additionally, there's a module called ScreenBooking that captures credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com. In the ProCC campaigns, the malware uses Delphi binaries with a backdoor that can collect data from the clipboard and printer spooler, as well as capture screenshots.

Credential Access part mentions that the attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTAs). They also sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks infected by the campaign. This access allows other cybercriminals to steal credit card details from hotel administration software.

So, the attackers' goal seems to be stealing credit card information, both directly from hotel systems and from OTAs. The ScreenBooking module specifically targets booking.com, which is an OTA. The ProCC malware also has capabilities to capture data from the clipboard, which could include credit card details if they are copied from a website or application.

Putting this together, after initial access via spear-phishing and execution of RATs, the attackers would likely use the obtained access to target not just the hotel's systems but also OTAs like booking.com. The ScreenBooking module is explicitly mentioned for capturing credit card data from these sites. Therefore, it's highly probable that they would collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations.

The attackers in the RevengeHotels campaign, after gaining initial access and executing RAT malware, would indeed collect credit card information from OTA websites. The ScreenBooking module targets booking.com, and the ProCC malware captures clipboard data, which could include credit card details. Thus, the answer is:

Final Answer: A: Yes
