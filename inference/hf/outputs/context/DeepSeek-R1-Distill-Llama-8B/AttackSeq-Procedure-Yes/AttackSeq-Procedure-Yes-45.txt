Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the KONNI malware will upload stolen data, like keystrokes and screenshots, to its C2 infrastructure after communicating via HTTP. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline mentions that KONNI is used in multiple campaigns over the years, starting with email attachments and .src files. It evolves, using decoy documents and becoming a dual-file structure. It steals credentials from browsers and can collect files, keystrokes, and take screenshots. The C2 communication is done via HTTP to domains like 000webhost, and it can upload, register, and download files.

The question is about whether, after using HTTP to communicate with C2, KONNI will upload stolen data, including keystrokes and screenshots. From the outline, I see that the malware is designed for data collection, including keystrokes and screenshots. It also mentions that it can perform exfiltration, which is the process of moving data out of a system. The C2 infrastructure is used for both command and control, which would include receiving data from the infected machines.

So, considering that KONNI is designed to collect this data and the C2 is set up to handle file uploads, it makes sense that the next step would be exfiltration. The fact that it's used in active campaigns as of April 2017 supports that it's still operational. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's likely that the data will be uploaded.

The KONNI malware is designed for data collection, including keystrokes and screenshots, and uses its C2 infrastructure to handle file uploads. Since it's still active, it's probable that it will exfiltrate this data.

Final Answer: A: Yes
