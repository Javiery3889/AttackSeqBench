Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used to enable continuous communication with hardcoded or known CnC addresses after exploiting a zero-day vulnerability through phishing campaigns. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, both APT3 and APT18 used phishing campaigns to deliver malicious payloads. APT3's payload was a DLL backdoor called SHOTPUT, which communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses. Similarly, APT18 used a GH0ST RAT variant that also communicates with a known CnC address.

The question is asking which ATT&CK technique enabled this communication. The options are T1071, T1566, T1572, or T1036.004.

Let me recall what each of these techniques entails:

- **T1071 (Application Layer Protocol):** This involves using legitimate protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc., to communicate. Since the backdoor uses HTTP, this seems relevant.

- **T1566 (Phishing):** This is about the initial attack method, which is already mentioned as the phishing campaigns. So this is more about how they got in, not the communication after.

- **T1572 (Protocol Tunneling):** This would involve techniques like VPNs or proxies to hide communication, but the CTI doesn't mention anything about that. The CnC is hardcoded and direct, so tunneling might not be needed.

- **T1036.004 (Masquerade Task or Service):** This is about creating fake services or tasks to avoid detection. Not directly related to communication methods.

So, the key here is that the backdoor uses HTTP to communicate with CnC. Therefore, T1071 is the correct technique.

The malicious payloads used by APT3 and APT18 communicate via HTTP, which falls under the ATT&CK technique T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). This technique is used to establish continuous communication with the hardcoded CnC addresses.
