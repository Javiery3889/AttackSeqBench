Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used when the Elise malware communicated with its C2 server. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The malware is called Elise, and it's distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document. When the document is opened, it drops an executable and uses a vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, to execute it. The payload is then moved to a specific folder and deleted.

In the Execution section, it starts Internet Explorer in a suspended state, injects a DLL into it, and calls a function. It creates a mutex to prevent duplicates and stores data in a thumbcache file. It also communicates with a hardcoded C2 server using an IP address.

Looking at the Persistence part, the malware uses a Run Registry key named IAStorD. So that's how it ensures it runs on each boot.

Now, the question is about the ATT&CK technique used when the malware communicates with the C2 server. The options are T1497, T1574.010, T1571, and T1071.

I remember that T1071 is about using non-standard ports. The question mentions a hardcoded IP address, which is 103.236.150.14. That's not a standard port, so maybe it's using a non-standard port. But wait, the IP is hardcoded, so maybe it's using a non-standard port, but the question is about the communication method.

Wait, T1071 is about using protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS, like using something like IRC or SMTP. But the question says it's sending data to and downloading from the C2 server. So maybe it's using a protocol like HTTP or HTTPS, but the port isn't standard. Or perhaps it's using a non-standard port, which would be T1571.

Alternatively, T1497 is about virtualization evasion, which doesn't seem relevant here. T1574.010 is about file permissions, which isn't related to communication.

So, the key point is that the communication is via a hardcoded IP and port. Since the port isn't specified, but it's not using the standard 80 or 443, it's likely using a non-standard port, which would be T1571. So the answer should be D: T1071-Application Layer Protocol or T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Wait, no, T1071 is about the protocol, not the port. T1571 is about using non-standard ports. So if the C2 communication is happening over a non-standard port, then T1571 applies. But the question is about the technique used when communicating, which is the protocol. Wait, no, the question is about the technique used when it communicates, which is the protocol, so T1071 is about using non-standard protocols, but the question is about the port. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the technique used when it communicates, which is the protocol. So if it's using a non-standard port, that's T1571. But if it's using a protocol like HTTP over a non-standard port, that's T1071. Alternatively, if it's using a different protocol, like IRC, that's T1071.

Wait, the CTI says it sends data to and downloads files from a hardcoded C2 server. It doesn't specify the protocol, but since it's a server, it's likely using HTTP or HTTPS. But the port isn't specified, so it's using a non-standard port, which would be T1571. So the answer is D: T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. T1071 is about using non-standard protocols, like using something other than HTTP/HTTPS. T1571 is about using non-standard ports. So if the communication is over HTTP but on a non-standard port, that's T1571. If it's using a different protocol, like IRC, that's T1071.

In the CTI, it's not specified, but the fact that it's a hardcoded IP and port suggests it's using a non-standard port. So the answer is D: T1571-Non-Standard Port.
</think>

The Elise malware communicates with its C2 server by using a non-standard port, which falls under the ATT&CK technique T1571-Non-Standard Port.

Final Answer: D: T1571-Non-Standard Port
