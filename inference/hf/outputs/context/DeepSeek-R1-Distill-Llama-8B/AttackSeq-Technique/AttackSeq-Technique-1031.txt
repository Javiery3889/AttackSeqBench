Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique facilitated the deployment of the Kingslayer backdoor into enterprise environments. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the Kingslayer backdoor was deployed using a stolen code signing private key. The private key was from Alpha's software packaging system, which was compromised between April 9th to 25th, 2015. So, the attackers used a compromised private key to sign the backdoor, making it look legitimate.

The question is asking which ATT&CK technique enabled this deployment. The options are A: T1195.003-Compromise Hardware Supply Chain, B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, C: T1021.005-VNC, and D: T1219-Remote Access Software.

I remember that the ATT&CK framework categorizes techniques based on how they're used. T1195 is about supply chain compromise. Specifically, T1195.003 refers to compromising hardware through a compromised supply chain, like tampering with hardware during manufacturing. T1195.005 is about software supply chain compromise, such as altering software during its development or distribution.

In this case, the attackers used a compromised private key from Alpha's software packaging system. This suggests that the software was altered after it was already in the supply chain, possibly during its packaging or distribution phase. So, it's more about the software supply chain rather than the hardware.

Looking at the options, T1195.003 is about hardware, which doesn't fit here. T1021.005 is about VNC, which is more about remote access via a virtual network computing session, not relevant here. T1219 is about remote access software, which could be a method, but the primary method here was the compromised private key, which ties to the supply chain.

So, the correct technique is T1195.005, but wait, the options don't have T1195.005. Wait, the options are A: T1195.003 and B: T1195. The main T1195 is about supply chain compromise, which can include both hardware and software. Since the attack involved a compromised software packaging system, it's more about the software supply chain, which would fall under T1195. So, the answer is B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise.
</think>

The Kingslayer backdoor was deployed using a compromised code signing key from Alpha's software packaging system, indicating a supply chain compromise. This aligns with ATT&CK technique T1195, which covers supply chain compromise, specifically T1195.005 for software. However, since the options only list T1195, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise
