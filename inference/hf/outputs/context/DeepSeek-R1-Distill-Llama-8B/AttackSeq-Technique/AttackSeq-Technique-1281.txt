Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used after Tropic Trooper exploited Microsoft Office's Equation Editor to gain access. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the CTI outline, Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, which are in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor. This allowed them to execute commands, specifically running an installer package via msiexec. The installer was downloaded from a URL and executed, which suggests that the initial access was through a malicious document that tricked the user into opening it, leading to the exploit.

Now, the question is about what technique was used when the backdoor's installer leveraged user action or interaction to deploy. The options are T1573-Encrypted Channel, T1564.009-Resource Forking, T1648-Serverless Execution, and T1204-User Execution.

Looking at the CTI outline, the installer was executed by the user because it was done via msiexec, which is a legitimate installer. The user's action of executing the installer package would fall under T1204-User Execution because it's the user interacting with the malicious document that led to the installation. 

T1573-Encrypted Channel is about using encrypted communication, which isn't mentioned here. T1564.009-Resource Forking is about creating new processes, which might not directly apply here. T1648-Serverless Execution involves using serverless computing, which isn't relevant since this is about a local installation.

So, the most likely technique is T1204-User Execution because the user's interaction with the document led to the installer being run.

The correct answer is T1204-User Execution because the backdoor's installer was triggered by the user executing the malicious document, which led to the installation of the backdoor.

Final Answer: D: T1204-User Execution
