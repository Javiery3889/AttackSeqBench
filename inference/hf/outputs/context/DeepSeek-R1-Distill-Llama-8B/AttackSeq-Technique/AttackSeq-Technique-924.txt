Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used by the Volatile Cedar malware to maintain its presence across reboots. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The outline describes the attack sequence, which includes various stages like Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Execution, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Lateral Movement, and Command and Control. 

The question specifically mentions that the Explosive Trojan dynamically loads a backend API DLL during runtime. So, the key point here is how the malware maintains its presence after a reboot. The options given are T1543, T1110, T1129, and T1574.014.

Let me go through each option:

- **T1543-Create or Modify System Process**: This technique involves creating or altering system processes to establish persistence. For example, adding a scheduled task or modifying a system service. If the malware creates a new process that runs on startup, that could help it maintain persistence. But the question is about dynamically loading a DLL, so I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

- **T1110-Brute Force**: This is about brute-forcing authentication, like password guessing. It doesn't directly relate to persistence mechanisms, so I don't think this is the right choice.

- **T1129-Shared Modules**: This technique involves using shared modules or libraries to avoid detection. It's about hiding by blending with legitimate processes. While this could help in evading detection, it doesn't specifically explain how the malware stays active after a reboot.

- **T1574.014-AppDomainManager**: This technique is about managing application domains in .NET environments. It allows the malware to inject code into running processes. If the DLL is loaded into the app domain, it can execute code without needing to be loaded into memory, which could help maintain persistence across reboots.

The CTI outline mentions that the Explosive Trojan uses a DLL that's dynamically loaded by the main executable. It also talks about defense evasion techniques like hiding from detection tools and using separate DLLs for suspicious activities. This suggests that the malware is using a modular approach, possibly leveraging existing processes or app domains to maintain its presence.

Given that the DLL is dynamically loaded, T1574.014 (AppDomainManager) seems to fit because it's about managing application domains, which would allow the malware to inject its code into existing processes without needing to be loaded into memory each time, thus persisting across reboots.
</think>

The correct answer is **T1574.014-AppDomainManager** because the malware uses a dynamic DLL loading approach, which aligns with the AppDomainManager technique to maintain persistence across reboots by injecting into existing processes.

Final Answer: D: T1574.014-AppDomainManager
