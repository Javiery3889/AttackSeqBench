Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used to communicate with compromised systems during the SolarWinds Orion compromise. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the CTI outline provided. The SolarWinds attack involved UNC2452, a known threat group. The initial access was through a supply chain compromise, specifically T1195.002, which is about compromising the software supply chain. So that's the entry point.

After initial access, the attackers used various Execution techniques. The CTI mentions T1072 Software Deployment Tools and T1569 System Services. So they deployed malicious code using these methods. This suggests they might have used these to establish a foothold in the system.

Now, the question is about Command and Control (C2) communication. The options given are A: T1665-Hide Infrastructure, B: T1071-Application Layer Protocol, C: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise, and D: T1036.001-Invalid Code Signature.

I know that T1195 is about supply chain compromise, which was the initial access method, not C2. T1036.001 is about invalid code signatures, which might relate to how they maintained persistence but not direct C2. T1665 is about hiding infrastructure, which is more about avoiding detection once they're in.

T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. I recall that in the SolarWinds case, the attackers used legitimate applications to communicate with their C2 servers. They used protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, which fall under T1071. This technique allows them to communicate over these protocols without raising suspicion.

So putting it together, the initial access was via T1195, but the C2 communication would have been via T1071, using legitimate protocols to send commands and exfiltrate data.

The SolarWinds attack used T1071 to communicate with compromised systems via legitimate protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, facilitating C2 without detection.

Final Answer: B
