Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used by TG-3279 for their C2 communication over port 443 without HTTPS. Let me start by going through the CTI outline provided.

First, the outline describes the attack sequence using MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Let me list them out in order:

1. **Reconnaissance**: They use open source research and network scanning.
2. **Resource Development**: They reuse network infrastructure, using domain names that might be unique or from legitimate companies.
3. **Initial Access**: They use a port scanning tool 's' and an RDP brute force tool 'rdp_crk'.
4. **Persistence**: They use DLLs to establish persistence with the Conpee plugin framework without modifying the registry or startup items.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: They compromise admin credentials.
6. **Lateral Movement**: They use key hosts as beachheads with Conpee or Etso tools. They add scheduled tasks using credentials from pwdump6.

The question is about the C2 communication using port 443 without HTTPS. Looking at the CTI, under Defense Evasion, it says their C2 uses port 443 but isn't HTTPS. It also mentions that the C2 is part of a larger framework called PATX. They use IP calculations and domain name parking to complicate investigations.

So, the key point is that they're using port 443 for C2, but not HTTPS. Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: T1071.003 - Mail Protocols. This is about using email protocols, which doesn't fit because the CTI mentions port 443, not email.

B: T1595 - Active Scanning. This is about scanning across multiple ports, but the question is about C2 communication, so probably not.

C: T1571 - Non-Standard Port. Port 443 is a standard port, but the CTI says it's non-HTTPS, so maybe this is about using a non-standard protocol on a standard port. Wait, but 443 is typically used for HTTPS, so using it without HTTPS would be non-standard. So T1571 would fit here.

D: T1583 - Acquire Infrastructure. This is about accessing resources, not C2 communication.

Wait, but the CTI says the C2 is part of the PATX framework. I'm not sure if that's a specific technique. Alternatively, maybe T1078.003 is about using non-standard ports, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, T1571 is about non-standard ports, so port 443 without HTTPS would be non-standard usage, hence T1571.

So the correct answer should be C: T1571-Non-Standard Port.
</think>

The correct answer is C: T1571-Non-Standard Port.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the C2 Communication Method**: The CTI states that TG-3279 uses port 443 for C2 without HTTPS.
2. **Understand the ATT&CK Technique**: The question asks which technique facilitates this. Port 443 is typically used for HTTPS, so using it without HTTPS makes it non-standard.
3. **Match with Answer Choices**: Among the options, T1571 refers to using non-standard ports, which fits the scenario of using port 443 without HTTPS.

**Final Answer: C**
