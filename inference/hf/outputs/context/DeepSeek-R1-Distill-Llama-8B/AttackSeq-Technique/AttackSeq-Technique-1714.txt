Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used to deceive users into executing the malicious '.lnk' files in the Mustang Panda campaign. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the CTI outline, the attack starts with spearphishing using '.lnk' files. These files contain embedded HTA scripts. When executed, these scripts drop decoy documents and run malicious payloads like Cobalt Strike Stagers and PlugX in the background. The question is about the technique used to deceive users into opening these files.

I remember that in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, each technique is labeled with a T-number. The options given are T1036-Masquerading, T1070.006-Timestomp, T1647-Plist File Modification, and T1566-Phishing.

Let me think about each option:

- **T1036-Masquerading**: This usually involves making something appear as something else, like a legitimate file or document. For example, making a file look like a document from a known legitimate company or person. The '.lnk' files might be masquerading as something else, like a document or an email attachment that looks official.

- **T1070.006-Timestomp**: This technique is about altering timestamps on files to make them appear older or newer than they are. I'm not sure how this would directly relate to deception in this context. It's more about covering tracks rather than making the file appear legitimate.

- **T1647-Plist File Modification**: This involves modifying configuration files (like .plist files on macOS) to change system settings or behaviors. I don't see any mention of modifying configuration files in the CTI outline, so this might not be the right fit.

- **T1566-Phishing**: Phishing is about tricking users into interacting with malicious links or files by impersonating a trusted entity. This could involve email spoofing or creating files that look like something official.

In the CTI outline, the '.lnk' files are used to deliver malicious payloads. The key here is that the files are being used to deceive users into executing them. Since the files are being used to trick users, it's likely a phishing technique. The files might be designed to look like something legitimate, like a document or an email attachment, to trick the user into opening them.

So, considering all this, the most likely technique is T1566-Phishing because it's about deceiving users into interacting with malicious files by impersonating a legitimate source.

The '.lnk' files used in the campaign were designed to deceive users into executing them, which aligns with the T1566-Phishing technique. This technique tricks users by impersonating legitimate entities, making the files appear trustworthy enough to be opened.

Final Answer: D: T1566-Phishing
