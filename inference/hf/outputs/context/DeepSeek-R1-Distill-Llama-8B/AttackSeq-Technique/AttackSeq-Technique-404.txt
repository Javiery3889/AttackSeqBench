Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique was used by the Gholee malware to avoid detection. Let me go through the CTI outline step by step.

First, the initial access was through a spear phishing email with a malicious Excel file. The file wasn't detected initially but was later detected as a Trojan. So, the initial access is via T1531.001 Spear Phishing Attachment.

Then, upon opening the Excel file, the macro uses ASCII codes to avoid detection. The macro creates a PE file and executes it using cmd.exe with some commands. This makes me think about how the malware is executing the malicious code. Maybe T1077.001: OS Command Execution, since it's using command-line tools.

The command and control part shows the malware communicates over port 443 using an expired certificate. It uses GET and POST requests. So, that's T1112.001 Data Collection. Also, the communication is over SSL, which is T1537.001 Data Encryption.

Now, the question is about the technique used before the malware avoided detection through debuggers and obfuscation. The options are T1529, T1036, T1027.014, and T1071.

T1529 is System Shutdown/Reboot, which doesn't seem related to avoiding detection during execution.

T1036 is Masquerading, which could involve hiding processes or files, but the outline mentions the use of macros and code to avoid detection, not necessarily masquerading.

T1027.014 is Polymorphic Code, where the code changes its form to avoid detection. The outline says the macro uses ASCII codes to concatenate into a variable, which might be a form of obfuscation, possibly indicating polymorphic code.

T1071 is Application Layer Protocol, which is more about communication, like using HTTP or HTTPS, which we've already covered with T1112.001.

So, the key part is the use of ASCII codes to avoid detection, which points towards T1027.014 Polymorphic Code.
</think>

The Gholee malware used polymorphic code techniques to avoid detection by obfuscating its code through ASCII character manipulation. This matches T1027.014.

Final Answer: C: T1027.014-Polymorphic Code
