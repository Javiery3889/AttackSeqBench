Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which ATT&CK technique is used to send the collected data out as Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the CTI outline provided. It talks about an iOS malware called XAgent, which is similar to SEDNIT malware for Windows. The malware is installed on compromised systems, and it's been around since before iOS 8 was released. 

Looking at the Execution part, the app is hidden on iOS 7 but not on iOS 8, and it restarts when terminated. That gives some info about its persistence, but maybe not directly relevant here.

The Discovery section lists what the malware can do: collect text messages, contacts, geo-location, etc. So the malware is gathering a lot of sensitive data.

Now, the question is about sending this data via Base64 encoded tokens with a random prefix. I need to match this to an ATT&CK technique.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1614-System Location Discovery – This is about gathering location data, which the malware does, but the question is about sending the data out, not just collecting it.

B: T1132-Data Encoding – This seems relevant because it's about encoding data, specifically Base64 with a prefix. That fits the description of sending the data out.

C: T1090.004-Domain Fronting – This is about using a domain for command and control, maybe, but the question is about encoding data, not communication method.

D: T1195.001-Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools – This is about exploiting software dependencies, which isn't directly related to data encoding.

So, the most likely technique is T1132-Data Encoding because it's about encoding the data into Base64 with a random prefix, which is exactly what the question describes.
</think>

The correct answer is B: T1132-Data Encoding.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Action**: The question focuses on sending data via Base64 encoding with a random prefix.
2. **Match with ATT&CK TTPs**: T1132 refers to Data Encoding, which involves converting data into a specific format for transmission.
3. **Eliminate Other Options**: Other techniques like T1614, T1090.004, and T1195.001 don't relate to data encoding but to location gathering, command and control, or software exploitation, respectively.
4. **Conclusion**: T1132 is the only technique that fits the described data transmission method.

**Final Answer: B**
