Okay, so I need to figure out which ATT&CK technique Gamaredon used after they used their backdoor to list interesting files. Let me start by going through the CTI outline provided.

First, the outline describes the attack sequence. The group starts with initial access via spearphishing emails. Then, during execution, they use various scripts like Batch and VBScript, and rundll32 to drop backdoors. For persistence, they use scheduled tasks, registry keys, and macros in documents.

In the discovery phase, it says their backdoor automatically lists interesting files, like Office documents, for future exfiltration. So after listing these files, they would need a way to gather those files. The question is about the technique used to collect sensitive documents from the system, drives, and network shares.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: T1596.002-WHOIS – I'm not sure about this one. I think WHOIS might relate to domain information, not file collection.

B: T1553-Subvert Trust Controls – This is about bypassing trust controls, maybe like exploiting misconfigurations, but not directly about collecting files.

C: T1119-Automated Collection – This sounds like it could be about automated tools used to gather data, which fits with the backdoor listing files and then collecting them.

D: T1213.001-Confluence – Confluence is a collaboration tool, so maybe exfiltration through that, but the question is about gathering from the system, not through a tool.

The CTI says they use the backdoor to list files and then exfiltrate. So the next step would be to collect those files, which is likely done through automated tools. So T1119-Automated Collection makes sense.

The correct answer is C: T1119-Automated Collection.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Context**: Gamaredon uses a backdoor to list interesting files for exfiltration.
2. **Understand the Question**: What technique is used to gather these files?
3. **Evaluate Answer Choices**:
   - A: Unrelated to file collection.
   - B: Relates to trust controls, not file gathering.
   - C: Refers to automated tools for data collection, matching the backdoor's role.
   - D: Involves Confluence, not direct file collection.
4. **Conclusion**: T1119-Automated Collection aligns with the described process.

**Final Answer: C**
