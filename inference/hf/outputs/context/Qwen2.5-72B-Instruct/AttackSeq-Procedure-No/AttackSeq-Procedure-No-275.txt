### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using current events to lure victims.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used, with filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating hidden system directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Extensive system information is collected, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including metadata and content.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via a custom TCP-based protocol with compressed and encrypted messages.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol over non-standard ports only after collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol with compressed and encrypted messages.
   - **Collection:** The report confirms that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including metadata and content.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it implies that data collection (discovery and collection) occurs before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection:** The report clearly indicates that Korplug collects metadata and content from all mapped drives, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also clearly states that data exfiltration is performed using a custom TCP-based protocol with compressed and encrypted messages.
   - **Order of Operations:** While the report does not explicitly state the order, it is logical to assume that data collection must occur before exfiltration, as the data needs to be collected before it can be exfiltrated.
   - **Non-Standard Ports:** The report does not specify whether the custom TCP-based protocol uses non-standard ports, but it is common for malware to use non-standard ports to evade detection.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of operations and the information provided in the report, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
