### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan is executed, consisting of a main executable binary and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:** The Explosive Trojan is installed with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan avoids detection by frequently changing versions, monitoring memory consumption, and detaching suspicious API activities.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** The campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework for control, including C&C servers, static update servers, and dynamic update servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Explosive Trojan will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for Lateral Movement before employing a multi-tiered server backend framework for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms that the Explosive Trojan uses keylogging to gain access to administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of SAML tokens or AD FS servers for lateral movement. Instead, it mentions that the attackers use various means to further penetrate the internal network, including manual online hacking and an automated USB infection mechanism.
   - **Command and Control:** The report clearly states that the campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any specific information about the use of SAML tokens or AD FS servers for lateral movement. The methods mentioned for lateral movement are manual online hacking and automated USB infection.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report does not include the abuse of SAML tokens before setting up the command and control infrastructure.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report, if the attackers were using SAML tokens for lateral movement, it would likely have been mentioned.
