### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access through the Log4Shell vulnerability, using PowerShell to download and execute a chain of scripts.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) to hide and protect malicious artifacts, employs DKOM, and uses stolen certificates and Themida for packing.
   - **Discovery:** Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Exfiltration:** Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Milestone backdoor will communicate with a C2 server over a non-standard port before exfiltrating data through the same C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:** The report confirms that the Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery and screen capture.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that the Milestone backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of non-standard ports for C2 communication. However, it is common for advanced APT groups to use non-standard ports to evade detection.
   - **Contextual Information:** The use of a kernel rootkit (Fire Chili) and stolen certificates suggests a sophisticated approach to evade detection, which could include using non-standard ports.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the Milestone backdoor and the use of advanced techniques like kernel rootkits and stolen certificates, it is plausible that the backdoor would use non-standard ports to communicate with the C2 server to avoid detection.
   - The report does not explicitly state the use of non-standard ports, but the context and the group's known capabilities suggest this is a likely scenario.
