### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Date:** July 12, 2021
- **Target:** Instagram users, particularly influencers
- **Method:** Impersonation of technical support or friends
- **Delivery:** Phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram
- **Lure:** Messages with generic greetings, claims of copyright violations, or offers of verified badges
- **Action:** Victims were lured into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface

**Impact:**
- **Ransom Demands:** Attackers demanded ransom payments in bitcoin, prepaid credit cards, or vouchers for the return of the compromised Instagram accounts
- **Continued Exploitation:** Even after some victims paid, the attackers did not restore access but continued to demand more payment
- **Further Use:** Stolen accounts with significant followings were used to perpetuate scams and the attackers sold their hacking expertise in the cybercriminal underground

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- **Context:** After impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges
