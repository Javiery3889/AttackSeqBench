### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
- SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
- Traffic was redirected from malicious domains to a proxy listening on a local port.
- Tunnel authentication was performed using the attackers' private keys.
- Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

**Execution:**
- Malicious code was executed through various methods.
- 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
- PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection) used to inject the final payload DLL into memory.
- 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).

**Defense Evasion:**
- Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
- Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

**Discovery:**
- SombRAT backdoor had capabilities for:
  - Process discovery
  - System information discovery
  - System time discovery
- Tools like pscan and nmap were used for network service scanning.

**Collection:**
- SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.

**Exfiltration:**
- SombRAT backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the CostaRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control channel, is it likely that it performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The SombRAT backdoor is explicitly mentioned to have capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery.
- The Discovery phase is clearly described as including these activities.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report clearly states that the SombRAT backdoor has capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery.
  - The Discovery phase is a logical step in the attack sequence after establishing the C2 channel.
- **B: No**
  - This answer would contradict the information provided in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report explicitly mentions that the SombRAT backdoor has capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery.
2. The Discovery phase is a critical step in the attack sequence, typically occurring after the initial access and execution phases.
3. Establishing a C2 channel is a necessary step before the Discovery phase, as the backdoor needs to communicate with the attackers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
4. Given the capabilities of the SombRAT backdoor and the logical sequence of the attack, it is highly likely that process discovery and system information discovery were performed during the Discovery phase.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
