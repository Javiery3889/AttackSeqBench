### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access through the Log4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **Others:** Attribution to Deep Panda and Winnti based on the use of Milestone backdoor and Fire Chili rootkit.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to deploy the Fire Chili kernel rootkit to achieve Defense Evasion by using Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) only after proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Discovery:** The Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery and screen capture.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The question specifically asks about the deployment of the Fire Chili kernel rootkit for DKOM after discovery functionalities.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report mentions the use of the Fire Chili rootkit, which is known for its DKOM capabilities, but it does not specify the exact sequence of deployment relative to discovery functionalities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the Milestone backdoor has discovery capabilities, including system information discovery and screen capture.
   - The report also mentions the use of the Fire Chili rootkit, which is known for its DKOM capabilities.
   - However, the report does not explicitly state that the Fire Chili rootkit is deployed only after the discovery functionalities are completed.
   - Given the nature of APT groups, it is plausible that they would deploy advanced tools like the Fire Chili rootkit at various stages of the attack to maintain stealth and evade detection. However, the specific sequence mentioned in the question is not supported by the report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
