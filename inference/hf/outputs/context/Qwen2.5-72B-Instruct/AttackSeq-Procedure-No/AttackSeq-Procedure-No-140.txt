### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance (July to August 2011):** The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Persistence (February 2014):** The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - **Credential Access (July to August 2011):** The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Command and Control (May 2015):** The attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks. Initial backdoors are relatively simple, but continually forward all SMS messages and call information back to their C2 servers. All identified victims reside in Japan or South Korea. 2015: A number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromise a number of Japanese companies involved in power generation, oil and natural gas, construction, finance, and transportation.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack group would send spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold into victim networks before securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Credential Access (July to August 2011):** The group used phishing domains to gather user credentials. This indicates that they were already using phishing techniques to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence (February 2014):** The group began securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems. This suggests that they had already gained access to the systems and were now looking to maintain that access.
   - **Command and Control (May 2015):** The group adopted and customized backdoors, indicating a more advanced stage of the attack where they were establishing and maintaining control over the compromised systems.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report shows that the group used phishing domains to gather credentials during the reconnaissance phase. This is a common initial step in many cyber attacks.
   - After gaining initial access through phishing, it is logical for the group to then use spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files to gain a foothold in the victim networks. This would allow them to execute malware and establish a more persistent presence.
   - The report also indicates that the group began securing alternative means of persistence in February 2014, which aligns with the idea that they would first gain access and then work on maintaining it.
