### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers targeted Instagram users, particularly influencers.
- They impersonated technical support or friends.
- They used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages.
- These messages contained generic greetings and claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges.
- The messages lured victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface.

**Impact:**
- The cybercriminals demanded ransom payments in bitcoin, prepaid credit cards, or vouchers for the return of the compromised Instagram accounts.
- Despite some victims paying the ransom, the attackers did not restore access but continued to demand more payment.
- They used the stolen accounts with significant followings to perpetuate their scams.
- They sold their hacking expertise in the cybercriminal underground.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After impersonating technical support or friends to deliver phishing messages claiming copyright violations or offering verified badges, is it likely that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect Instagram usernames, passwords, and email credentials?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Impersonate technical support or friends.
   - Deliver phishing messages via various channels (emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram).
   - Lure victims into providing credentials on phishing sites.

2. **Impact:**
   - Demand ransom payments.
   - Continue to demand more payment even after receiving initial payments.
   - Use stolen accounts to perpetuate scams.
   - Sell hacking expertise.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the attackers will lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect more credentials.
  - This sequence does not align with the CTI report. The report indicates that the attackers first lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites, which implies that the account compromise happens after the credentials are collected, not before.

- **B: No**
  - This suggests that the attackers will not lock out the original owners by changing account passwords only before using phishing sites to collect more credentials.
  - This aligns with the CTI report. The report clearly states that the attackers use phishing sites to collect credentials first, and then they can use these credentials to lock out the original owners and demand ransom.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the attackers first use phishing sites to collect credentials from the victims.
- After obtaining the credentials, they can then lock out the original owners and demand ransom.
- The sequence described in the question (changing passwords before using phishing sites) does not match the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
