### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Execution:**
  - APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
  - RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.
  - RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output, and installs persistently.

- **Persistence:**
  - RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.

- **Defense Evasion:**
  - RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.

- **Credential Access:**
  - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

- **Collection:**
  - APT15 used tools like CSVDE, BCP, and bespoke tools to extract information from various sources.

- **Others:**
  - NCC Group tracked APT15's movements over more than a year.
  - Ahmed Zaki highlighted the sophistication of APT15.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that APT15 used valid account information (such as VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks instead of deploying backdoors like BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Credential Access:**
  - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
  - This indicates that APT15 had valid account information (VPN credentials).

- **Execution and Persistence:**
  - APT15 deployed multiple backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
  - RoyalDNS is particularly noted for its persistent installation and DNS-based communication.

- **Defense Evasion:**
  - RoyalCLI evades policy settings by patching cmd.exe, indicating a sophisticated approach to maintaining access.

- **Context:**
  - The use of both valid account information and backdoors suggests a multi-faceted approach to maintaining access and evading detection.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Obtaining Valid Credentials:**
   - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
   - This provides them with valid account information for remote access.

2. **Deploying Backdoors:**
   - Despite having valid credentials, APT15 also deployed multiple backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
   - These backdoors serve as additional entry points and can be used to maintain access even if the valid credentials are changed or revoked.

3. **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
   - The backdoors, especially RoyalDNS, are designed to be persistent and evade detection.
   - This indicates a strategic approach to ensure long-term access to the network.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - While APT15 did use valid account information (VPN credentials), they also deployed backdoors to ensure they had multiple methods of accessing the network.
   - The use of both methods suggests a comprehensive and sophisticated approach to maintaining access.

### Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes

APT15 likely used valid account information (such as VPN credentials) to remotely access victim networks, but they also deployed backdoors to ensure they had multiple methods of maintaining access.
