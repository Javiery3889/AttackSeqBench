### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing documents (Office Excel files) with malicious macros.
     - Macros release and execute a backdoor program.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious macro releases WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 and 12-B-366.txt (HTA file) into the %TEMP% directory.
     - HTA file launches the PowerShell script.
     - PowerShell script decodes and decompresses content, writes it to OfficeUpdateService.exe, and executes it.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Backdoor program checks for "st:off" and "pd:off" parameters.
     - If checks pass, it writes startup items for persistence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Backdoor program gathers host information after executing evasion techniques.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with C2 server through DNS tunneling.
     - Command dispatch loop and taskHandler function for command execution.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the backdoor program is likely to use **ListPlanting** to inject code into a trusted process before gathering host information through evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **ListPlanting:**
     - ListPlanting is a technique where an attacker injects code into a trusted process by manipulating the linked list of processes in the Windows kernel. This is a sophisticated technique often used for persistence and evasion.
   - **Sequence in the CTI Report:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor program gathers host information after executing evasion techniques.
     - There is no explicit mention of ListPlanting or any code injection technique in the report.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The backdoor program uses DNS tunneling for C2 communication and checks for virtual machines, sandboxes, or debugging environments.
     - The report focuses on the initial access, execution, persistence, and C2 communication, but does not detail any code injection techniques.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any evidence that the backdoor program uses ListPlanting or any other code injection technique before gathering host information.
   - The sequence described in the report is more focused on the initial access, execution, persistence, and C2 communication.
   - Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the backdoor program uses ListPlanting before gathering host information.
