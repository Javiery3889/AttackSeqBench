### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
     - SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
     - Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed through various methods.
     - 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
     - 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).
     - PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection) injected the final payload DLL into memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
     - Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.
   - **Collection:**
     - SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
     - C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
     - RSA encryption for AES key exchange.
     - Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - SombRAT backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT malware will archive collected data using a custom storage file format before employing its process discovery and system time discovery capabilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the CostaRicto Campaign used process injection and deobfuscation to decode information related to the SombRAT backdoor.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report explicitly states that the SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Process Discovery and System Time Discovery:**
     - The report does not mention process discovery or system time discovery capabilities explicitly.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the SombRAT backdoor archives collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - The report does not provide any information about process discovery or system time discovery capabilities.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the SombRAT malware will employ process discovery and system time discovery capabilities after archiving collected data, as these capabilities are not mentioned in the report.

### Final Answer
