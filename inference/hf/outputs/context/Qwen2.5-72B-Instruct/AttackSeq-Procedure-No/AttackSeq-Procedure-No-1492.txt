### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Iranian threat actors used fake personas on social media to connect with US officials and gather information.
     - They created over a dozen fake personas, including falsified identities from news organizations and attractive women profiles.
     - The attackers connected with over 2,000 individuals to access information on their location, activities, and relationships.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The NEWSCASTER operation involved creating fake personas and a fictitious news organization to support their espionage activities.
     - They used these personas to establish connections on social media platforms and harvest credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers used low-tech approaches to avoid traditional security defenses, exploiting social media and the human element.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The campaign focused on credential harvesting and reconnaissance.
     - The attackers used social media connections to harvest corporate and personal email credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After establishing connections on social media, the attackers used the harvested credentials to potentially move laterally within the networks of their targets.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The campaign leveraged malware with the capability to exfiltrate data, although the malware used was not particularly sophisticated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian hackers sent "consent phishing" emails containing malicious links designed to steal usersâ€™ access tokens before attempting to gain initial access by using social media platforms and sending spear-phishing messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Resource Development:**
     - The report emphasizes the use of fake personas and social media to gather information and establish connections.
     - The attackers used these connections to harvest credentials.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The focus was on harvesting credentials through social media connections.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of "consent phishing" emails containing malicious links to steal access tokens.
     - The initial access method described is primarily through social media and spear-phishing messages.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers used low-tech approaches to avoid traditional security defenses, which aligns more with social engineering and social media-based attacks rather than sophisticated phishing techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report focuses heavily on the use of social media and fake personas to establish connections and harvest credentials.
   - There is no mention of "consent phishing" emails or malicious links designed to steal access tokens.
   - The attackers' methods were described as low-tech and focused on exploiting the human element through social media.
   - Given the emphasis on social media and the lack of mention of more sophisticated phishing techniques, it is less likely that the attackers used "consent phishing" emails before attempting to gain initial access through social media and spear-phishing.

### Final Answer: B: No
