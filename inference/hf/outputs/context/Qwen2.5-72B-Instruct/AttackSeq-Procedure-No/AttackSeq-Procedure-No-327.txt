### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after the iOS malware sends gathered information, writes log messages, uses a token for communication, and uploads files during the Command and Control phase, it is likely that the app will subsequently collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data on the victim's device during the Discovery phase.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware is designed to collect various types of information, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
- This collection is part of the Discovery phase.

**Key Points from the Question:**
- The question asks about the likelihood of the app collecting information after the Command and Control phase.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the malware is designed to collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
- The Discovery phase is where this collection occurs.
- The Command and Control phase involves sending gathered information, writing log messages, using tokens for communication, and uploading files.
- It is logical that the malware would continue to collect information in the Discovery phase even after performing Command and Control activities, as the collection of information is a continuous process for maintaining persistence and gathering more data.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The malware is designed to collect information as part of its core functionality.
- The Discovery phase is where this collection occurs.
- The Command and Control phase involves sending the collected information, but it does not preclude the malware from continuing to collect more information.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that the app will continue to collect information such as text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data after performing Command and Control activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
