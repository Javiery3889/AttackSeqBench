### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Data from network shared drives, archived using utilities.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Web services, web shells, and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance only after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, following the use of WMI for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement, which is consistent with the question.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing to obtain credentials, which is also consistent with the question.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** The report mentions that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials, which implies internal reconnaissance. However, it does not explicitly state that they use native OS binaries and scripts for this purpose only after gaining credentials via LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question (WMI for lateral movement, followed by credential access via LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing, and then internal reconnaissance using native OS binaries and scripts) is plausible based on the report.
   - The report indicates that FIN13 uses a variety of techniques for internal reconnaissance and credential access, but it does not specify the exact order or the use of native OS binaries and scripts only after gaining credentials.
   - However, given the sophistication and thoroughness of FIN13's operations, it is reasonable to assume that they would use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance after gaining credentials to avoid detection and gather more detailed information.
