### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The FHAPPI campaign used an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- The malware was a VBScript encoded script hosted under the account 'vbiayay1'.
- When executed, the script downloaded a .doc file and opened it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The campaign utilized multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding.
- The attack was fileless, avoiding known signatures.
- The attack did not originate from the attacker's territory, improving the chances of a successful APT campaign.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicated with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15, a dial-up IP in South Korea.
- The domain used for C2 communication was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.
- The WHOIS information for the domain included contact details for 'Liu Ying'.

**Others:**
- The FHAPPI campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI).
- The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code.
- The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.
- The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian.
- The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities.
- The campaign was linked to a larger APT campaign and utilized email addresses 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing.
- The CNC IP address and the email sender addresses are recommended to be blocked and traced.
- The malware files associated with the campaign have been deleted with the help of Yahoo Incident Response Division (YIRD), JP-CERT/CC, and other security professionals in Japan.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website and the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution, is it likely that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility instead of using PowerShell for further execution?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - APT phishing email with a link to malware on a Geocities website.
   - VBScript encoded script is downloaded and executed.
   - The script downloads a .doc file and opens it.
   - PowerShell is used to execute the malware and infect the system with Poison Ivy.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection.
   - Fileless attack to avoid known signatures.
   - Attack does not originate from the attacker's territory.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - Communication with a C2 server using a specific IP and domain.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the malware will install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
  - However, the CTI report clearly states that the malware uses PowerShell for further execution, not a cron job.
  - Cron jobs are typically used in Unix-like systems, while the report indicates the use of PowerShell, which is a Windows feature.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that the malware will not install itself as a cron job using the cron utility.
  - This aligns with the information in the CTI report, which states that the malware uses PowerShell for further execution.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly mentions that the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
- The use of PowerShell is a key part of the attack sequence, and there is no mention of cron jobs or any Unix-like system utilities.
- The malware's fileless nature and the use of PowerShell for execution are consistent with the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
