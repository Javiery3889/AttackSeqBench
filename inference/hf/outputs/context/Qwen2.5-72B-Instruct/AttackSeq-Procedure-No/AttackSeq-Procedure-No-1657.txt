### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- The malware is a VBScript encoded script that, when executed, downloads a .doc file and opens it.
- This leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

**Execution:**
- The VBScript creates a shell object and executes a PowerShell command to run base64 encoded code.
- This code downloads and executes a .ps1 file from another URL.
- The .ps1 file contains more base64 encoded code, which, when decoded, reveals the infection code for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- The malware masquerades as a 'Security Update' process and uses PowerShell to execute the base64 code.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicates with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15.
- The domain used for C2 communication is 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.
- The WHOIS information for the domain includes contact details for 'Liu Ying'.

**Others:**
- The campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI).
- The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code.
- The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.
- The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian.
- The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities.
- The campaign was linked to a larger APT campaign and utilized email addresses 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing.
- The CNC IP address and the email sender addresses are recommended to be blocked and traced.
- The malware files associated with the campaign have been deleted with the help of Yahoo Incident Response Division (YIRD), JP-CERT/CC, and other security professionals in Japan.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After executing encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads from URLs, is it likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection only after establishing connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses VBScript and PowerShell to download and execute payloads.
- The payloads are base64 encoded and downloaded from URLs.
- The malware communicates with a C2 server at 61.97.243.15.
- The main payload is Poison Ivy, which is injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.

**Evaluation:**
- The report indicates that the malware uses file-based techniques (downloading and executing .doc and .ps1 files) to establish the initial infection and communicate with the C2 server.
- There is no explicit mention of fileless techniques being used after the initial infection and C2 communication.
- Fileless techniques typically involve running code directly in memory without writing to the disk, which is not described in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report describes a sequence where the malware uses file-based techniques to download and execute payloads.
- The report does not mention any fileless techniques being used after the initial infection and C2 communication.
- Given the detailed description of the file-based techniques and the absence of any mention of fileless techniques, it is unlikely that the FHAPPI campaign would switch to fileless techniques only after establishing a connection with the C2 server.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
