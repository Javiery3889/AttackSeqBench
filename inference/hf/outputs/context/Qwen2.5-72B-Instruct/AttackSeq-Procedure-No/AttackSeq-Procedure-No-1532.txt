### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with the delivery of an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various VBScripts and batch files were executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Persistence:** 'stopedge.bat' scheduled 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' was present.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scripts were heavily obfuscated, and 'stopedge.bat' managed file deletions to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** 'versioninfo.bat' collected information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** 'versioninfo.bat' prepared the collected information for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicated with the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to upload the collected data to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox before exfiltrating it via a POST request.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Method:** The CTI report mentions that 'unactivate.vbs' was capable of exfiltration through a POST request. There is no mention of using Dropbox or any other cloud storage service for exfiltration.
   - **Data Collection and Exfiltration:** The 'versioninfo.bat' script collected information and prepared it for exfiltration, which was then handled by 'unactivate.vbs' via a POST request.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report does not provide any evidence or indication that the Konni APT Group uses Dropbox or any other cloud storage service for data exfiltration. Their primary method of exfiltration, as described, is through POST requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the exfiltration of data is done via a POST request using the 'unactivate.vbs' script.
   - There is no mention of using Dropbox or any other cloud storage service for data exfiltration.
   - The group's modus operandi, as described, involves direct communication with the C2 server for exfiltration.
