### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating hidden directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with initial handshakes over HTTPS or TCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug malware is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol only before gathering data from network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.
   - **Network Shared Drives:** The report does not explicitly mention the sequence of exfiltration and gathering data from network shared drives. However, it does mention that the malware collects extensive system information, which could include information about network shared drives.
   - **Sequence:** The question implies a specific sequence where exfiltration happens before gathering data from network shared drives. The report does not provide a clear sequence of these actions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the malware collects extensive system information, which could include data from network shared drives, but it does not specify the exact sequence of exfiltration and gathering data from network shared drives.
   - The exfiltration process is described as occurring via a custom TCP-based protocol, but the report does not state that this happens before gathering data from network shared drives.
   - Given the lack of explicit sequence information, it is not accurate to assume that exfiltration happens only before gathering data from network shared drives.
