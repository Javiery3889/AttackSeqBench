### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access:**
  - SolarWinds was compromised in a sophisticated supply-chain attack.
  - The attackers deployed a custom backdoor, Sunburst, on the networks of over 18,000 customers.
  - This initial access allowed for further exploitation.
- **Additional Information:**
  - HAFNIUM, a new APT actor, exploited four zero-days in Exchange Server for initial access.
  - A campaign active since mid-March targeted governmental entities in the Russian Federation using these Exchange zero-days.
  - The campaign utilized a previously unknown malware family named FourteenHi.
  - There were overlaps with HAFNIUM in terms of infrastructure and TTPs, as well as the use of ShadowPad malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access, is it likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the CTI Report:**
  - The Sunburst backdoor was deployed as part of a supply-chain attack.
  - The backdoor allowed for further exploitation, implying it was used after the initial access was achieved.
- **Logical Analysis:**
  - The Sunburst backdoor was designed to be deployed after the initial access was achieved through the supply-chain attack.
  - The backdoor's primary purpose is to maintain and extend the attacker's presence in the network, which requires communication with a C2 server.
  - It would not make sense for the backdoor to communicate with a C2 server only before the initial access is achieved, as the backdoor is a post-compromise tool.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The Sunburst backdoor was deployed as part of a supply-chain attack to gain initial access.
  - Once the initial access was achieved, the backdoor was used to maintain and extend the attacker's presence in the network.
  - Communication with the C2 server is a critical function of the backdoor, which occurs after the initial access is achieved.
  - Therefore, it is not likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol only before the initial access is achieved.

**Final Answer: B: No**
