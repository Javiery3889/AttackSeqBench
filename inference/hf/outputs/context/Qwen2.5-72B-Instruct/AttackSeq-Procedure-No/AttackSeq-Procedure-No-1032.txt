### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report describes the use of Cobalt Strike's beacon for initial access, which can be installed and executed in various forms and communicates with the C&C server using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** After gaining initial access, attackers use tools like Mimikatz to steal account information, requiring higher privileges than Administrator. They may use UAC bypass or LPE vulnerabilities to achieve this.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Cobalt Strike provides techniques to bypass detection, including packet manipulation and process manipulation.
   - **Discovery:** Attackers use tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather information about the network and connected PCs, including Active Directory details.
   - **Others:** The report discusses various cases of Cobalt Strike usage in different stages of cyber attacks, including ransomware attacks and lateral movement.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token to achieve lateral movement after using tools like ADFind and port scanning to gather Active Directory and network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report clearly states that attackers use ADFind and port scanning to gather information about the network and Active Directory.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the abuse of SAML tokens from a compromised AD FS server. However, it does discuss the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and the importance of gathering Active Directory information.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report emphasizes the use of various techniques for lateral movement, including the use of stolen credentials and the manipulation of network communications.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to Lateral Movement:** After gathering Active Directory and network information, attackers often look for ways to move laterally within the network. This can involve using stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities, or abusing trust relationships.
   - **SAML Token Abuse:** While the report does not explicitly mention SAML token abuse, it is a known technique in the cybersecurity domain. Compromising an AD FS server and abusing SAML tokens can be a highly effective method for lateral movement, especially in environments where SAML is used for authentication.
   - **Plausibility:** Given the detailed information gathering and the focus on lateral movement in the report, it is plausible that attackers would use any available method, including SAML token abuse, to achieve their goals.
