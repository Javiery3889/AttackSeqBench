### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Functions used: `LoadLibraryA`, `CreateProcessA`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`, `LdrRegisterDllNotification`, `LdrUnregisterDllNotification`, `cmd.exe /C`, `powershell`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Functions used: `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, `DeleteKey`.
     - Registry key: `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Functions used: `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, `ZwClose`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS.
     - Strings: `Mozilla/5.0`, `Host:`, `http://`, `https://`, `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=%s`, `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="upload_file"; filename="%s"`.
   - **Others:**
     - Encoding and obfuscation techniques.
     - GUIDs for unique identification.
     - File path manipulation.
     - Use of `runas` and `copy` commands.
     - ActiveX objects and Internet Explorer settings manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that operators would use the `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` function to detect the presence of a debugger before proceeding to command and control activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Queries:**
     - The report mentions the use of `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` for system information collection, which aligns with the initial part of the question.
   - **CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`. However, the defense evasion section includes various functions that manipulate memory and processes to avoid detection, which suggests a focus on evading security mechanisms.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report clearly indicates the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control activities, which aligns with the latter part of the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of functions like `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, and `ZwMapViewOfSection` indicates a sophisticated approach to evading detection. While `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` is not explicitly mentioned, it is a common technique used by adversaries to ensure their code is not being analyzed in a debugging environment.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical for adversaries to check for the presence of a debugger before engaging in command and control activities to avoid detection and analysis. This would ensure that their communication with the command and control server is not intercepted or monitored.
