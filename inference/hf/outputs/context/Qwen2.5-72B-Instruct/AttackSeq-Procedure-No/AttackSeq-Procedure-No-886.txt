### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used weaponized RTF files, archive files with malicious DLLs, and direct executable loaders to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key, and sometimes injected itself into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group operated C&C servers within limited daily windows, used fileless loading techniques, and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:** The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
   - **Command and Control:** The Aria-body backdoor used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with C&C servers, sending collected data along with an XORed password and listening for additional commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor is likely to enumerate AWS storage services (S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes) during the Discovery phase before sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The CTI report does not mention any specific activities related to enumerating AWS storage services. The Aria-body backdoor's capabilities are listed as creating/deleting files and directories, taking screenshots, searching for files, launching files, enumerating process loaded modules, gathering file metadata, closing TCP sessions, collecting OS information, and verifying location using external services. None of these activities specifically mention AWS services.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The report confirms that the Aria-body backdoor sends collected data to the C&C domain using HTTP and TCP protocols, along with an XORed password.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor's capabilities are focused on local and network activities within the compromised system, such as file and process manipulation, screenshot capture, and OS information collection. There is no indication that the backdoor has the capability or intent to enumerate AWS storage services.
   - The group's primary targets are national government entities in the Asia Pacific region, which are less likely to have extensive AWS infrastructure compared to cloud-based businesses.
