### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server before collecting system information during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention a Discovery phase, but it is a common step in the MITRE ATT&CK framework where attackers gather system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server as part of their Collection tactics.
   - The Discovery phase typically occurs after gaining initial access and before or during the Collection phase to gather information that can be used to further the attack.
   - Given the sequence of events described in the report, it is more likely that FamousSparrow would perform the Discovery phase to gather system information before or during the Collection phase, rather than after exfiltrating file contents.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
