### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries gather publicly available information and use active discovery methods.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign to deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) using weaponized MS Office email attachments.
     - Employees must enable macros for the RAT to be installed.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware establishes a connection to an attacker-controlled C2 server after installation.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance to discover potential targets and expand access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Adversaries use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct further reconnaissance.
   - **Impact:**
     - Adversaries develop and deliver malicious code, schedule UPS disruptions, trip breakers, and initiate a telephony DoS attack.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will perform a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT after establishing a C2 connection through malicious VBA script execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a phishing campaign where adversaries send targeted emails with weaponized MS Office attachments.
     - Employees must enable macros for the RAT to be installed.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - After the RAT is installed, it establishes a C2 connection.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The phishing campaign (Initial Access) occurs before the C2 connection is established.
     - The C2 connection is established as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The phishing campaign is the initial step to deliver the RAT and gain initial access to the network.
   - The C2 connection is established after the RAT is installed, which is a result of the successful phishing campaign.
   - Therefore, the phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT occurs before the C2 connection is established, not after.
