### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, which has been updated over time.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup' (display name: 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service').
   - **Credential Access:** The malware targets various software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bat email client, Outlook Express, Outlook, and Google Desktop. It also steals Windows credentials and exports certificates.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information. It also searches removable drives for files.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to enumerate Azure AD users as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not mention any specific discovery operations related to Azure AD users. The focus is on credential access and information collection from local and network resources.
   - **Collection:** The report details the use of a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer for information collection. It also mentions searching removable drives for files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not indicate any specific operations related to enumerating Azure AD users. The focus is on local and network credential theft and information collection.
   - The malware's primary targets are local applications and system credentials, which are more aligned with the described collection methods (keylogger, screenshotter, clipboard stealer).
   - Enumerating Azure AD users would typically be a more advanced and specific operation, often associated with cloud-based attacks, which is not mentioned in the report.
