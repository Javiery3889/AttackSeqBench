### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT41 has conducted reconnaissance activities, targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems, particularly ahead of Chinese officials' stays, suggesting tasks to reconnoiter facilities for security reasons.
   - **Execution:** APT41 deploys a variety of malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits, to execute their operations within compromised systems.
   - **Persistence:** APT41 has deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits to maintain persistence on select victim systems, with bootkits adding stealth by executing before the operating system initializes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT41 uses bootkits for defense evasion, which are executed prior to the operating system initializing, adding an extra layer of stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials within compromised systems.
   - **Discovery:** APT41 is adept at moving laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, to discover and access game production environments.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until accessing game production environments.
   - **Collection:** APT41 collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments.
   - **Impact:** APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and has attempted to deploy ransomware in the video game industry for financial gain.
   - **Others:** APT41 is a Chinese cyber threat group involved in state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated operations since 2014. They are known for supply chain compromise tactics, limiting malware deployment to specific systems, and using non-public malware typically reserved for espionage in financially motivated activities. APT41's malware arsenal includes over 46 different families and tools, and they have been linked to Chinese espionage contractors advertising their services online. The group's activities suggest a blurred line between state power and crime.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities such as targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that APT41 has conducted reconnaissance activities, specifically targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems. This is part of their initial activities, which can be seen as a precursor to gaining initial access.
   - The report does not explicitly state the sequence of gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails followed by reconnaissance. However, it is common for advanced threat actors like APT41 to conduct reconnaissance before and after gaining initial access to gather more information and plan their next steps.
   - Given APT41's sophisticated nature and the detailed reconnaissance activities described, it is highly likely that they would continue to gather intelligence even after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT41 is known for conducting thorough reconnaissance activities.
   - The report mentions that they target call record information and hotel reservation systems, which are valuable for understanding the environment and planning further actions.
   - Spear-phishing is a common initial access vector for APT groups.
   - After gaining initial access, it is logical for APT41 to continue their reconnaissance to gather more detailed information about the compromised systems and the network.
