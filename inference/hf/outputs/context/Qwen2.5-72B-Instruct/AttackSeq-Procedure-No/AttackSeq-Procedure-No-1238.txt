### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT28 scans for targets, focusing on Ukraine and Spain.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits.
   - **Execution:** Deploys a dropper (runrun.exe) and a second stage component (winloat.exe) to take control of the machine.
   - **Persistence:** Changes file timestamps to hide files.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses a tool exploiting CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool to contact internal systems.
   - **Credential Access:** Deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on mimikatz to dump passwords from LSASS.
   - **Collection:** Collects data using pr.dll and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:** Transfers stolen data, including emails and files, to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups during the Discovery phase after deploying a password dumper (run.exe) to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS during Credential Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report clearly states that APT28 uses a password dumping tool (run.exe) to access credentials from logged-in users through LSASS.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention the enumeration of permissions associated with Windows groups. However, it is a common practice in the Discovery phase to understand the network and system environment, including user and group permissions, to facilitate further actions such as lateral movement and privilege escalation.
   - **Contextual Information:** APT28 is known for thorough and methodical attacks, often involving multiple stages of reconnaissance, exploitation, and data collection. Enumerating permissions would be a logical step to understand the environment better and identify high-value targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT28 has a comprehensive attack strategy that includes multiple stages of reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - After gaining credentials through the password dumper (run.exe), it is highly likely that APT28 would want to understand the permissions associated with the obtained credentials to identify which accounts have higher privileges and can be used for further actions.
   - The enumeration of permissions is a crucial step in the Discovery phase to facilitate lateral movement and privilege escalation, which are key tactics in APT28's attack methodology.
