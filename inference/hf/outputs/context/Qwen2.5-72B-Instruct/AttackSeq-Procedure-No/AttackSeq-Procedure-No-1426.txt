### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved through a malicious installer (20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe) that placed spyware components in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` directory and launched `sysCrt32.exe`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The spyware establishes persistence by adding the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` folder to the `%PATH%` environment variable and setting up scheduled tasks to run `sysBus32.exe` every 3 hours.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The spyware uses `libchrome.exe` to query Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords.
   - **Collection:**
     - The collection process involves `sysOptimizer.bat`, `libCache32.exe`, and `libTemp32.exe` to collect and archive personal files, perform keylogging, and clipboard content logging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The C2 servers are hosted on Novinhost, and the malware uses `curl.exe` to access the FTP servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The exfiltration process is handled by `sysUp32.bat`, which collects and uploads files to the FTP server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the spyware will use Windows DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) for execution of commands and a malicious VBS before establishing persistence by ensuring the WindowsApps folder is added to the `%PATH%` environment variable.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved by placing spyware components in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` directory and launching `sysCrt32.exe`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report states that the spyware establishes persistence by adding the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` folder to the `%PATH%` environment variable and setting up scheduled tasks.
   - **Windows DDE and VBS:**
     - The report does not mention the use of Windows DDE or a malicious VBS for executing commands. The persistence mechanism described is through environment variable manipulation and scheduled tasks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access and persistence mechanisms are clearly outlined in the report.
   - The report does not mention the use of Windows DDE or a malicious VBS for command execution.
   - The persistence mechanism described in the report is different from the one suggested in the question.
