### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
- They sent 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails containing a Cozyduke payload to compromise high-profile government networks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
- It communicates with over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.

**Credential Access:**
- The Duke group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell) and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials.

**Collection:**
- Seaduke allows attackers to:
  - Retrieve detailed bot/system information.
  - Update bot configuration.
  - Upload files.
  - Download files.
  - Securely delete the malware from the system using a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.

**Exfiltration:**
- Seaduke archives sensitive information and exfiltrates data via legitimate cloud services.
- It also performs secure file deletion.

**Others:**
- The Duke group has been active since at least 2010.
- They have a range of malware tools, including Cozyduke, Miniduke, and Cosmicduke.
- They target high-profile networks and have sophisticated operational capabilities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that Seaduke will:
- Retrieve detailed bot/system information.
- Securely delete itself using a 'seppuku' function.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Seaduke is capable of retrieving detailed bot/system information.
- Seaduke has a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
- **B: No**

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that Seaduke can retrieve detailed bot/system information and has a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.
- These capabilities are part of the Collection and Exfiltration tactics described in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report confirms that Seaduke can retrieve detailed bot/system information.
2. The CTI report also confirms that Seaduke has a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.
3. Both of these capabilities are mentioned in the context of the malware's operations.
4. Therefore, it is likely that Seaduke will utilize these functions as part of its attack sequence.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
