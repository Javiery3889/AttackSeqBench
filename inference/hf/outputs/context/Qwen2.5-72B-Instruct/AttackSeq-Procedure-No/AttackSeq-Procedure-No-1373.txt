### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Word document that uses the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code.
     - The DDE technique is used to invoke PowerShell commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader.
     - The control server domain is webviewres[.]net.
   - **Others:**
     - The document is distributed from hxxp://sendmevideo[.]org/SaberGuardian2017.docx.
     - The document calls sendmevideo[.]org/dh2025e/eh.dll to download Seduploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after:
     - Gaining initial access using the DDE technique.
     - Using Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) to download a file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report confirms that the initial access is gained using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique.
     - The DDE technique is used to invoke PowerShell commands.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The document contacts a control server to download the first stage of the malware, Seduploader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with the sequence in the CTI report:
       1. Initial access using DDE.
       2. Using PowerShell to download a file.
       3. Creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question matches the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report. Therefore, it is likely that APT28 will create persistence through a batch file and registry entry only after gaining initial access using the DDE technique and using Command and Scripting Interpreter to invoke PowerShell commands to download a file.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
