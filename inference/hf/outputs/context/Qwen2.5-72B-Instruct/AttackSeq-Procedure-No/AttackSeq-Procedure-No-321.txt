### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- It runs in the background immediately after installation.
- It can restart automatically on iOS 7 but not on iOS 8.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the app uploads files via FTP protocol as part of its Command and Control operations, is it likely to send the gathered information via HTTP only after performing routines on the iOS device?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The app performs various data collection routines.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of FTP or HTTP for data exfiltration.
- The report focuses on the app's ability to collect and store data on the device.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This would imply that the app sends data via HTTP only after performing the data collection routines.
  - The report does not provide explicit information about the exfiltration method (FTP or HTTP) or the sequence of exfiltration.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that the app does not necessarily send data via HTTP only after performing the data collection routines.
  - The report does not specify the exact sequence of exfiltration methods, and it is more likely that the app uses multiple methods for data exfiltration, including FTP and HTTP, without a strict sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly state that the app sends data via HTTP only after performing the data collection routines.
- The report mentions that the app collects various types of information but does not specify the exact sequence or method of exfiltration.
- Given the lack of specific information about the exfiltration sequence, it is more plausible that the app uses multiple methods (FTP and HTTP) for data exfiltration without a strict sequence.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
