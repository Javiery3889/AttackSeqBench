### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deleted itself.
- UserInstall.exe dropped:
  - A normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool)
  - A malicious loader (in "C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll")
  - An encrypted configuration file
- UserInstall.exe used BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
- The malicious loader used DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launched dllhost.exe.
- The loader injected a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
- Malicious documents with embedded backdoor droppers were observed.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor decrypts an encrypted configuration file and uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- DLL hijacking was used to evade antivirus detection.
- The installer dropped files into the Apple/Update directory and created a hidden directory (UFile) as a ruse.
- The loader executed dllhost.exe and injected a malicious DLL backdoor.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient used custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

**Others:**
- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- These documents use job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations to target recipients.
- The MSI file drops files and creates a hidden directory as a ruse.
- TClient uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
- The SSL certificate is registered recently and set to expire after a year.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Tropic Trooper exploited either CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to gain initial access, is it likely that various social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the system configuration file dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe)?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- These documents use job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations to target recipients.
- The initial access is gained through these documents, which exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.

**Analysis:**
- The report does not mention the use of social media channels for spearphishing.
- The initial access is described as being gained through exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents, which are delivered directly to the targets.
- The use of job vacancies in socio-politically sensitive organizations suggests a targeted approach, but it does not specify the method of delivery beyond the documents themselves.

**Conclusion:**
- The report does not provide evidence that social media channels were used to spearphish victims before the system configuration file dropped the backdoor installer.
- The initial access is clearly described as being gained through exploit-laden documents, which are delivered directly to the targets.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
