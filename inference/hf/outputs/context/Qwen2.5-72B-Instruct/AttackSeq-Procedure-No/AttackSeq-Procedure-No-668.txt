### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** The actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, and atexec).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The actors used a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The actors ran commands to discover system and network information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The actors moved laterally by dumping credentials with a variant of Mimikatz and using Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The actors used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate with the compromised server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the actors will gather account credentials via a keylogger before moving laterally to other systems using Impacket's atexec tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the actors used the Dumpert tool to evade antivirus and EDR solutions.
   - **Credential Gathering:** The report states that the actors used a variant of Mimikatz to dump credentials, not a keylogger.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that the actors used Impacket's atexec to move laterally using the dumped credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials, not a keylogger.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report is:
     1. Defense Evasion (using Dumpert and custom Mimikatz).
     2. Credential Dumping (using Mimikatz).
     3. Lateral Movement (using Impacket's atexec with the dumped credentials).
   - There is no mention of a keylogger being used for credential gathering.

### Final Answer
