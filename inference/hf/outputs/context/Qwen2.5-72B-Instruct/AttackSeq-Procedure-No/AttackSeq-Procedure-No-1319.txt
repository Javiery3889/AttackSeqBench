### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Ensured by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Discovery:** Collects system information, running processes, open ports, and data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Collection:** Collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, browser bookmarks and cookies, chat history, and data from removable media.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Sayad will use oversimplified obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding or export a managed API through the native Export Address Table for defense evasion only after ensuring persistence by modifying the registry to run DiagnosticsService.dll at startup using rundll32.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that Sayad ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of oversimplified obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding or exporting a managed API through the native Export Address Table. However, the malware is described as unique in its implementation and uses a .NET OOP/OOD background, which suggests a more sophisticated approach to evasion.
   - **Sequence:** The question asks if these defense evasion techniques are used only after ensuring persistence. The report does not provide a clear sequence of these actions, but it does indicate that the malware is sophisticated and likely uses more advanced techniques for evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report emphasizes the sophistication of the Sayad malware, including its unique implementation and the use of a .NET OOP/OOD background.
   - The use of oversimplified obfuscation techniques like Base64 encoding is less likely for a sophisticated malware like Sayad.
   - The report does not provide a clear sequence of actions that would confirm the use of these techniques only after ensuring persistence.
   - Given the sophistication of the malware, it is more likely that it uses more advanced techniques for defense evasion, not just oversimplified ones.
