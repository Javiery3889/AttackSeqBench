### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
- A binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe".

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
- The attack used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.

**Lateral Movement:**
- APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network.

**Command and Control:**
- APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.
- Communication with compromised systems used HTTP GET requests to specific URLs and transmitted heartbeat packages using Cookie fields with 60-second intervals.

**Others:**
- APT-TOCS is related to Cobalt Strike.
- The attack can penetrate firewalls and is undetectable.
- The threat has been active for 5 years and is considered an APT due to its targeted nature, anti-detection functions, and ability to conceal itself.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After APT-TOCS gained initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems, is it likely that PowerShell scripts were utilized to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses during the attack's core step instead of Shellcode script functionalities being executed in memory?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report clearly states that APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control. This indicates that the initial access was achieved by executing Shellcode scripts.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report mentions that the attack included running in memory and no hard disk writing operations. This aligns with the use of in-memory execution to evade detection.

**Credential Harvesting:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of a credential harvesting tool. However, it is common for APTs to use credential harvesting as part of their attack lifecycle to gain further access and move laterally within the network.

**In-Memory Execution:**
- The report emphasizes that the attack ran in memory and used multi-beacon communication to evade detection. This suggests that the attack was designed to operate in memory to avoid leaving traces on the disk.

**PowerShell Scripts:**
- The report mentions the use of PowerShell scripts for command and control and encrypted data scripts. This indicates that PowerShell was a key component of the attack, but it does not specify the use of PowerShell for credential harvesting.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access:** APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
- **Defense Evasion:** The attack ran in memory and used multi-beacon communication to evade detection.
- **Credential Harvesting:** While not explicitly mentioned, it is a common tactic for APTs to use credential harvesting tools.
- **In-Memory Execution:** The attack was designed to run in memory to avoid detection.

Given the emphasis on in-memory execution and the use of PowerShell for command and control, it is plausible that PowerShell scripts were used to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses. However, the report does not provide direct evidence of this specific step.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
