#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed list of the data and information the malware captures.
- The primary focus is on credit card data, clipboard content, and screenshots.
- There is no mention of capturing mouse movements, which suggests it is not a feature of the malware used in the RevengeHotels campaign.
- Given the specific data collection methods described, it is unlikely that the malware would include a feature to capture mouse movements, as it does not align with the campaign's goals.

**Final Answer: B: No**
