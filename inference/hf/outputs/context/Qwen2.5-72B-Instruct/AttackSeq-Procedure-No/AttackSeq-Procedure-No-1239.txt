### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 scans for new targets, particularly in Ukraine and Spain.
     - Uses a python script, a database, scan bots, and a Django application for administration and reporting.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses spear phishing emails, typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames.
     - First stage: dropper named runrun.exe.
   - **Execution:**
     - Second stage: dropper named winloat.exe.
     - Deploys tools like run.exe, xp.exe, and svehost.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Changes file timestamps to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Uses CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploys a password dumping tool based on mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems.
     - Bots report back to a central server.
   - **Collection:**
     - Deploys pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to discover vulnerable systems through scanning IP ranges and report results to a centralized server after using advstoreshell.dll for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that APT28 uses bots to scan IP ranges and identify vulnerable systems.
     - These bots report back to a central server.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The report mentions the use of a C&C server for communication, but it does not specifically mention advstoreshell.dll.
     - However, the use of a C&C server is a common tactic for APT28, and the question implies that the C&C communication is established.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that APT28 uses a multi-stage attack process.
   - After gaining initial access and establishing C&C communication, APT28 continues to discover and report on vulnerable systems.
   - The use of advstoreshell.dll for C&C communication is consistent with the overall attack pattern described in the report.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that APT28 will continue to discover vulnerable systems through scanning and report results to a centralized server after establishing C&C communication.
