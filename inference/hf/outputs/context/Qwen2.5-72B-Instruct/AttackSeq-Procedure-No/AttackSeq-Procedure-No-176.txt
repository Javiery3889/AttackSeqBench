### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Whitefly uses spear-phishing emails with a dropper to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The dropper executes a loader (Trojan.Vcrodat) that uses search order hijacking to execute malicious DLLs and establish communication with a C&C domain.
   - **Persistence:** Whitefly maintains long-term access using tools like a simple remote shell and Termite.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Whitefly exploits a known Windows vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) and uses Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Whitefly uses search order hijacking and custom malware to remain undetected.
   - **Credential Access:** Whitefly uses Mimikatz to harvest credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Whitefly uses stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
   - **Collection:** Whitefly aims to steal large volumes of sensitive information.
   - **Command and Control:** Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Whitefly exfiltrates large volumes of information over time.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Whitefly will use malware to repeatedly check the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system before using tools to steal large volumes of sensitive information for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant TTPs from the CTI Report:**
     - **Lateral Movement:** Whitefly uses stolen credentials to compromise additional machines.
     - **Collection:** Whitefly aims to steal large volumes of sensitive information.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - Whitefly's primary goal is to maintain long-term access and exfiltrate large volumes of information.
     - The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to remain undetected and achieve its objectives.
   - **Evaluation of the Question:**
     - The question suggests a specific behavior (repeatedly checking the mouse cursor position) that is not mentioned in the CTI report.
     - The CTI report does not indicate that Whitefly uses such a technique to determine if a real user is on the system.
     - The focus of Whitefly's activities is on maintaining persistence, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration, rather than on user activity monitoring.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not mention any techniques related to checking the mouse cursor position.
   - Whitefly's primary methods for maintaining access and exfiltrating data do not involve user activity monitoring.
   - The group's focus is on using stolen credentials and maintaining long-term presence to achieve its objectives.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
