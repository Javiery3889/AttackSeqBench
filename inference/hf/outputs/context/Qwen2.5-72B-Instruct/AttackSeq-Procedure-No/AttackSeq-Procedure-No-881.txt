### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
     - Archive files with legitimate executables and malicious DLLs for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Through 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Injection into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Limited daily C&C server activity.
     - Fileless loading techniques.
     - Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Gathered information includes host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, and public IP.
     - Collected data on installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used HTTP and TCP protocols.
     - Sent collected data to C&C domain with an XORed password.
     - Listened for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase only after engaging in Collection phase activities like creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report clearly states that the Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, including host-name and public IP, during the Discovery phase.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The report mentions that the Aria-body backdoor engages in creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The Discovery phase activities (gathering system information) are described as occurring before the Collection phase activities (creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, etc.).
     - The report does not indicate that the Discovery phase activities are dependent on the Collection phase activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Discovery phase involves gathering detailed system information, which is a prerequisite for the Collection phase.
   - The Collection phase activities, such as creating/deleting files and taking screenshots, are performed after the initial system information is gathered.
   - Therefore, the Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase, which occurs before the Collection phase.
