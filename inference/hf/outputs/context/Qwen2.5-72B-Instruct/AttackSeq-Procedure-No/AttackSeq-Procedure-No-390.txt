### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Tactic: Defense Evasion**
  - **Technique: AtomBombing**
    - **Description**: AtomBombing is a technique that allows threat actors to inject malicious code into trusted processes to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products.
    - **Capabilities**:
      - Bypass process-level restrictions.
      - Access context-specific data (e.g., screenshots).
      - Perform Man in the Browser (MitB) attacks.
      - Access encrypted passwords.
    - **Characteristics**:
      - Does not require exploiting operating system bugs or vulnerabilities.
      - Cannot be fixed with a patch.
      - Security products must monitor API calls for malicious activity to mitigate this technique.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After threat actors use AtomBombing to leverage Windows operating system mechanisms for malicious code injection and execute it via legitimate programs, is it likely that they will use a VBA script, such as embedding it within a malicious Word document, as part of their strategy?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Attack Sequence from CTI Report**:
  1. **Defense Evasion**:
     - **AtomBombing**: Inject malicious code into trusted processes.
     - **Execution via legitimate programs**: Use trusted processes to execute the injected code.

- **Question Context**:
  - The question asks if it is likely that threat actors will use a VBA script embedded in a Word document after using AtomBombing.

- **Evaluation**:
  - **AtomBombing** is a sophisticated technique that allows for code injection into trusted processes without requiring vulnerabilities or patches. It is designed to evade detection and operate within the context of legitimate processes.
  - **VBA Script in Word Document**:
    - VBA scripts in Word documents are typically used as an initial infection vector to gain a foothold in the system.
    - Once the initial infection is achieved, threat actors often use more advanced techniques like AtomBombing to maintain persistence and evade detection.
  - **Sequence Analysis**:
    - The CTI report focuses on the use of AtomBombing after gaining access to the system.
    - VBA scripts in Word documents are more commonly used as an initial entry point, not as a follow-up to a sophisticated injection technique like AtomBombing.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - AtomBombing is a post-exploitation technique used to maintain persistence and evade detection.
  - VBA scripts in Word documents are typically used for initial infection and are less likely to be used after the threat actors have already gained access and are using more advanced techniques.
  - Therefore, it is not likely that threat actors will use a VBA script embedded in a Word document after using AtomBombing.

**Final Answer: B: No**
