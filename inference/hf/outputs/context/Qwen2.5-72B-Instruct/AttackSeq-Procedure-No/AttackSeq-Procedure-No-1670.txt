### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated the second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade network security solutions.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - **Others:**
     - The malware used a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine observed in previous Operation Troy samples. The C2 servers were compromised websites, likely due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will use Google Drive for C2 before communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report mentions that the C2 servers used in the recent attacks were compromised websites, not Google Drive.
     - The report also states that the C2 communication involved encrypted and base64-encoded commands using a custom base64 alphabet.
   - **Google Drive:**
     - There is no mention of Google Drive being used for C2 communication in the report.
   - **Custom Base64 Alphabet:**
     - The report confirms that the malware used a custom base64 alphabet for communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the C2 servers were compromised websites, not Google Drive.
   - The report also confirms the use of encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
   - Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the TDrop2 malware would use Google Drive for C2 communication.
