### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using current events to lure victims.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used, with filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating a hidden system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant is likely to enumerate Azure AD groups to collect information before using a custom TCP-based protocol to communicate with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that the Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, but it does not specifically mention enumeration of Azure AD groups.
   - **Command and Control:** The report confirms that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any information about the Korplug variant enumerating Azure AD groups. The collection activities described are focused on local, removable, and network shared drives.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report does not include enumeration of Azure AD groups as a step before C&C communication.
   - Given the focus on local and network data collection, it is unlikely that the Korplug variant would specifically enumerate Azure AD groups as part of its standard operation.
