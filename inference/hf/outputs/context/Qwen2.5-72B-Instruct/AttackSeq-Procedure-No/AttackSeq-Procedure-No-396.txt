### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: APT41 targets call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems, particularly ahead of Chinese officials' stays.
- **Execution**: APT41 deploys a variety of malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.
- **Persistence**: APT41 uses rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence.
- **Defense Evasion**: APT41 uses bootkits for defense evasion.
- **Credential Access**: APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers.
- **Discovery**: APT41 moves laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems.
- **Lateral Movement**: APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks.
- **Collection**: APT41 collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments.
- **Impact**: APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and has attempted to deploy ransomware in the video game industry.
- **Others**: APT41 is involved in state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated operations, uses supply chain compromise tactics, and has a blurred line between state power and crime.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
The question asks whether it is likely that APT41 compromises information technology providers and software developers providing services to targets of interest to gain initial access, prior to using spear-phishing emails.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance**: The report mentions that APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities, targeting call record information at telecom companies and hotel reservation systems. This suggests that APT41 is interested in gathering information about their targets.
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: The "Others" section explicitly states that APT41 uses supply chain compromise tactics. This indicates that APT41 is known to compromise service providers and software developers to gain access to their targets.
- **Spear-Phishing**: While the report does not explicitly mention spear-phishing, it is a common initial access technique used by many APT groups, including APT41. However, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of supply chain compromise before spear-phishing.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Reconnaissance and Targeting**: APT41's reconnaissance activities suggest they gather detailed information about their targets, which can include identifying service providers and software developers.
2. **Supply Chain Compromise**: The report explicitly mentions that APT41 uses supply chain compromise tactics. This is a sophisticated method that allows them to gain initial access to their targets by compromising trusted third parties.
3. **Initial Access**: Given the sophistication of APT41 and their known use of supply chain compromise, it is highly likely that they would use this method to gain initial access before resorting to more common techniques like spear-phishing.
