### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Packrat targets high-profile political figures, journalists, and others in Latin American countries using malware and phishing.
   - **Resource Development:** Packrat has a persistent campaign with significant resources, including multiple malware command and control domains and fake online organizations.
   - **Initial Access:** Packrat uses phishing attacks and fake news organizations to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Packrat uses COTS RATs and obfuscates their malware with various tools.
   - **Persistence:** Packrat's malware includes features for persistence and monitoring.
   - **Command and Control:** Packrat uses specific domains for C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Packrat will clear logs from `/var/logs` and `/Library/logs` during execution before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that Packrat uses phishing and fake news organizations to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The report states that Packrat uses COTS RATs and obfuscates their malware with various tools. However, it does not mention any specific actions related to clearing logs.
   - **Persistence and Command and Control:** The report details the use of malware with persistence features and C2 infrastructure, but again, does not mention log clearing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Log Clearing:** The report does not provide any evidence that Packrat clears logs from `/var/logs` and `/Library/logs`. While log clearing is a common technique to avoid detection, the report does not indicate that Packrat employs this specific tactic.
   - **Obfuscation and Runtime Packers:** The report clearly states that Packrat uses various obfuscation techniques and runtime packers to bypass defenses. This aligns with the question's mention of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques.

Given the information provided in the CTI report, it is more likely that Packrat focuses on obfuscation and runtime packers to bypass defenses rather than clearing logs from specific directories.
