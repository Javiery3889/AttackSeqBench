### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The BlackEnergy APT group used Excel documents with macros to drop the BlackEnergy Trojan.
- A new attack vector involved a Microsoft Word document named "$RR143TB.doc" with macros.
- The document enticed users to enable macros to view content related to the "Right Sector" party in Ukraine.
- Upon enabling macros, the payload "vba_macro.exe" was executed, which dropped a DLL file as "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT" and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.

**Execution:**
- The macro built a string in memory containing the file "vba_macro.exe".
- This file was executed using the Shell command, leading to the execution of the BlackEnergy dropper.

**Persistence:**
- The BlackEnergy dropper ensured execution on every system startup by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder.
- The LNK file executed the command "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on every system boot.

**Impact:**
- The BlackEnergy APT group's attacks in Ukraine focused on destructive actions, compromising industrial control installations, and espionage activities.
- The earliest signs of destructive payloads with BlackEnergy date back to June 2014, with recent attacks showing more sophisticated high-level wiping capabilities targeting file extensions.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky Lab's products detect the various trojans mentioned as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten.* and HEUR:Trojan-Downloader.Script.Generic.
- More information about BlackEnergy APT and extended IOCs are available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Services.
- For countering BlackEnergy and similar threats, Kaspersky Business Blog provides additional insights.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on every system boot, is it likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for its C2 communications?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The report mentions that the final payload connected to a C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114, which is currently offline.
- There is no explicit mention of the use of a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) in the report.

**Evaluation:**
- The use of a static C&C server (5.149.254[.]114) suggests that the BlackEnergy Trojan in this specific attack did not use a DGA.
- DGAs are typically used to generate a large number of domain names to make it harder for defenders to block or take down the C&C infrastructure.
- The report does not provide any evidence or indication that the BlackEnergy Trojan used a DGA in this attack.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the final payload connected to a specific C&C server (5.149.254[.]114).
- There is no mention of the use of a DGA in the report.
- The use of a static C&C server is a simpler and more straightforward method for maintaining C2 communications, which is consistent with the information provided in the report.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
