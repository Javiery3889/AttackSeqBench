### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Example: CVE-2014-4148 embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Follows Vault 7 guidelines for avoiding detection.
- Practices include wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, secure erase protocols, and randomization of communication intervals.

**Discovery:**
- Malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
- Uses operational security measures to remain undetected.

**Collection:**
- Malware has extensive remote control commands and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
- Designed for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers.
- Uses privacy services to hide real identity.
- Communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been protecting customers and tracking Longhorn.
- Infiltrated governments, international organizations, and various sectors.
- Operates with high operational security, standard Monday to Friday working week, and appears to be from an English-speaking, North American country.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After communicating externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals, will Longhorn's malware configure a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Compromise target using backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
2. **Defense Evasion:** Use techniques to avoid detection (e.g., wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, secure erase protocols, randomization of communication intervals).
3. **Discovery:** Perform detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
4. **Collection:** Use extensive remote control commands and customizable plugins.
5. **Command and Control:** Configure specific domain and IP address combination per target, use privacy services, and communicate over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.

**Question Context:**
- The question focuses on the communication and C&C configuration after exfiltration.
- It mentions that the malware communicates externally with upload limits and randomized intervals to avoid detection.
- It asks if the malware then configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that Longhorn's malware uses specific domain and IP address combinations per target for C&C communication.
- It also mentions that the communication is over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
- The report aligns with the sequence described in the question, where the malware communicates externally with upload limits and randomized intervals to avoid detection, and then configures the C&C communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report confirms that Longhorn's malware uses specific domain and IP address combinations per target for C&C communication.
- The report also states that the communication is over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.
- The sequence described in the question matches the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report, including the use of upload limits and randomized intervals to avoid detection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
