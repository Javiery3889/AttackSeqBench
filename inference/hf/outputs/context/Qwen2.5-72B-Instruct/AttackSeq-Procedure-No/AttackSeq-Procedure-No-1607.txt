### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India, often using LNK files and decoy documents.
   - **Resource Development:** Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and uses phishing portals to trick victims into divulging credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs, as well as self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers, as well as registry keys and VBScripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Sets up fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - **Exfiltration:** Targets Kavach MFA app and exfiltrates authentication databases.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to execute infection chains involving malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs only after establishing initial access to victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs as part of their initial access techniques. This indicates that these elements are part of the initial infection chain.
   - **Execution:** The report also mentions that SideCopy deploys RATs and plugins post-infection, which suggests that the initial access is followed by the execution of these RATs and plugins.
   - **Sequence:** The sequence described in the report suggests that the initial access is achieved using malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs, and then the infection chain proceeds with the deployment of RATs and other malicious activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report explicitly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs to gain initial access to victim systems.
   - **Post-Infection Activities:** After gaining initial access, SideCopy deploys RATs and other plugins for further malicious activities.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** The sequence of TTPs described in the report aligns with the initial access being achieved through malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs, followed by the execution of RATs and other post-infection activities.
