### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Both Moafee and DragonOK used similar tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
     - They used custom-built backdoors and RATs like CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy.
     - They used HTRAN to disguise their geographical location.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Similar custom-built backdoors and RATs were used.
     - HTRAN was used to disguise geographical location.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Primary attack vector: spear-phishing emails with well-crafted, tailored content.
     - Attachments were executable files in ZIP archives or password-protected Microsoft Office documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Evasion techniques: environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents.
     - 'CPU core check' technique to detect and avoid virtualized environments.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registry entries were used to ensure startup persistence.
     - The CT/NewCT implant creates a registry entry file called 'Windows.reg' and imports it using 'regedit.exe /s Windows.reg'.
     - The contents of 'Windows.reg' are OS-specific.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Techniques to evade detection: environment-based evasion, large file sizes, password-protected documents, 'CPU core check', and large null-padded files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK achieve persistence through the creation and importing of OS-specific registry entries using the CT/NewCT implant.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the CT/NewCT implant creates a registry entry file called 'Windows.reg' and imports it using 'regedit.exe /s Windows.reg'.
   - The contents of 'Windows.reg' are OS-specific, which aligns with the question's description of OS-specific registry entries.
   - The report also mentions that this is done to ensure startup persistence, which is a form of persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides clear evidence that the CT/NewCT implant is used to create and import OS-specific registry entries.
   - This technique is specifically mentioned as a method to ensure startup persistence.
   - The question aligns perfectly with the information provided in the report.
