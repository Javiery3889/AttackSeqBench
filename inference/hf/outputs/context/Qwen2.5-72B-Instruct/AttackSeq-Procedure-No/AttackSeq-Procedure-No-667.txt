### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** The actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, and atexec).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The actors used a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The actors ran commands to discover system and network information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The actors moved laterally by dumping credentials with a variant of Mimikatz and using Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The actors used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate with the compromised server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the actors will move laterally to other systems on the network by executing commands through Impacket's atexec tool only before performing OS credential dumping using Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the actors used the Dumpert tool to evade antivirus and EDR solutions.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the actors moved laterally by dumping credentials with a variant of Mimikatz and using Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Defense Evasion:** Upload and use Dumpert to evade detection.
     2. **Credential Dumping:** Use a variant of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** Use Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems using the dumped credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials before using Impacket's atexec for lateral movement.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the actors will use Impacket's atexec only before performing OS credential dumping using Mimikatz.
   - This sequence (using atexec only before Mimikatz) is not supported by the report. The report shows that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials first and then used atexec for lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
