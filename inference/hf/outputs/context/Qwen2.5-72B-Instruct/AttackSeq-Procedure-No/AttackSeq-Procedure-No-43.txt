### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, opening a decoy file, and running the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks, use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating processes, gathering browser data, and keylogger information.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication, implementing fallback channels, downloading additional files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to steal clipboard contents, capture screenshots, and stage encrypted data in a temporary folder after exfiltrating all collected files to remote servers and the C&C server using encrypted and compressed transmission methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that Machete uses FTP and HTTP for exfiltration and can use fallback channels. It also states that the malware can download additional files and use these methods for C&C communication.
   - **Collection Activities:** The report clearly states that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The question implies a sequence where exfiltration happens first, followed by further collection activities. However, the report does not explicitly state that these collection activities occur after exfiltration. Instead, it describes these activities as part of the overall collection process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that Machete performs various collection activities, including stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder, as part of its data collection process.
   - The question asks if these activities are likely to occur after exfiltration. While the report does not explicitly state the order, it is reasonable to infer that Machete might continue its collection activities even after exfiltrating data, as part of its ongoing operations.
   - However, the question specifically asks if these activities are likely to occur **after** exfiltration, and the report does not provide a clear sequence indicating this.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the report, it is not explicitly stated that Machete will steal clipboard contents, capture screenshots, and stage encrypted data in a temporary folder **after** exfiltrating all collected files. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
