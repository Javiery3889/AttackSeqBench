### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Deployed loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) via a registry key.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
     - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placed a copy of the loader/spreader malware in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Set a registry key for automatic execution.
     - Attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Killed specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
     - Packed backdoor malware with Themida to evade analysis and detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Copied the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
     - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses to establish connections to SMB shares.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Backdoor malware communicated with remote C&C servers.
     - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number.
     - Polled the remote C&C for tasks and executed remote commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware after establishing command and control communication.
   - Double-extortion ransomware involves exfiltrating files and then encrypting them to prompt victims to pay a ransom.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report clearly states that the backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote C&C servers and executed remote commands.
   - **Exfiltration and Encryption:**
     - The report does not mention any activities related to exfiltrating files or encrypting them.
     - The primary focus of the attack was on establishing persistence, evading defenses, and moving laterally within the network to perform unauthorized transfers via the SWIFT network.
   - **Context:**
     - The report provides background on the FEIB heist, which involved unauthorized transfers and the arrest of individuals in Sri Lanka related to cashing out transferred funds.
     - There is no indication of ransomware activities in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report details the Lazarus group's activities, which primarily involved deploying malware, establishing persistence, evading defenses, and moving laterally to perform unauthorized financial transactions.
   - The report does not mention any activities related to exfiltrating files or encrypting them for ransom.
   - Given the focus on financial theft and the lack of any mention of ransomware activities, it is unlikely that the Lazarus group engaged in double-extortion ransomware in this specific attack.

### Final Answer: B: No
