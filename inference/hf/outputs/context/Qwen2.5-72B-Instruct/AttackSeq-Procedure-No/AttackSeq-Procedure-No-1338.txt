### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119).
- The exploit was embedded within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) during a legal case tribunal.
- The exploit targeted visitors interested in the case.

**Execution:**
- The malware payload, identified as Rdws.exe, deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique.
- It used the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll).
- The malicious DLL then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses.
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Others:**
- The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit.
- The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information.
- ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion, is it likely that the malware will use multiple layers of encryption within malware to protect C2 communication instead of connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploit a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
2. **Execution:** Deploy the main component via DLL sideloading.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Use sideloading to evade defenses and connect back to the exploit domain and subdomain.

**Key Points:**
- The malware uses a DLL sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL.
- The malware connects back to the exploit domain and a subdomain for C2 communication.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This suggests that the malware will use multiple layers of encryption to protect C2 communication.
- **B: No** - This suggests that the malware will not use multiple layers of encryption and will connect back to the exploit domain.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, which are part of the attackers' infrastructure.
- The report does not mention any use of multiple layers of encryption for C2 communication.
- Given the context, it is more likely that the malware uses a straightforward connection to the exploit domain rather than implementing complex encryption mechanisms.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
