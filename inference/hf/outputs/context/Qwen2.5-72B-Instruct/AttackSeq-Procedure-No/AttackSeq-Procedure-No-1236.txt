### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.
     - Phishing websites on typosquatted domains.
     - Malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits.
   - **Execution:**
     - Second stage component installed by a dropper (winloat.exe) writes key components to the disk.
     - Tools like a password dumper (run.exe), privilege escalation tool (xp.exe), and proxy tool (svehost.exe) are deployed.
   - **Persistence:**
     - File timestamps are changed to 14/04/2008, 16:00 to hide files.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2014-4076) to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool to contact systems behind routers.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems.
     - Bots report back to a central server.
   - **Collection:**
     - Deploys additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - C&C communication via HTTP on port 443 or 80, sometimes encrypted.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to send phishing emails containing malicious links designed to collect users’ credentials before employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails for gaining initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
     - Bots report back to a central server.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.
     - Phishing websites on typosquatted domains.
     - Malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - APT28 deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on mimikatz to collect credentials.

   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The report indicates that APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents as part of the initial access phase.
     - The credential access phase involves deploying a password dumping tool, which is a post-compromise activity.
     - There is no mention of APT28 sending phishing emails containing malicious links designed to collect users’ credentials before the initial access phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase involves scanning and identifying vulnerable systems.
   - The initial access phase involves using spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.
   - The credential access phase involves deploying a password dumping tool after gaining initial access.
   - The sequence described in the question (sending phishing emails containing malicious links to collect credentials before using crafted Word and Excel documents) does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
