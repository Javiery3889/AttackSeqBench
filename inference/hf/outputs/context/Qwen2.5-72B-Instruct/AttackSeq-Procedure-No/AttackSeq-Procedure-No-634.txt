### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The INOCNATION campaign used a decoy installer for Cisco AnyConnect Mobility Client to gain initial access. The installer was disguised as a legitimate application and would execute regardless of the user's decision to cancel the installation.
   - **Execution:** The RAT installer executed a malicious DLL payload, which was obfuscated and rebuilt during installation. The malware employed anti-behavioral analysis techniques, such as comparing mouse cursor positions to detect sandbox environments.
   - **Persistence:** The RAT installer set up a persistence mechanism by creating a registry key for entrenchment.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware used encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections for command and control communications, employing Windows' standard SSL/TLS libraries. It also used a single-byte XOR encoding within the decrypted SSL/TLS communication to further obfuscate the communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the INOCNATION campaign will use Debugger Evasion tactics, such as the `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` function or checking system flags and CPU registers, before establishing command and control through encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections with additional XOR encoding.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that the campaign used a decoy installer and executed a malicious DLL payload with anti-behavioral analysis techniques.
   - **Debugger Evasion:** The report mentions anti-behavioral analysis techniques, such as comparing mouse cursor positions to detect sandbox environments. However, it does not explicitly mention Debugger Evasion tactics like `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` or checking system flags and CPU registers.
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that the malware used encrypted HTTPS via SSL/TLS connections and additional XOR encoding for command and control communications.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly mention Debugger Evasion tactics. While the malware employs anti-behavioral analysis techniques, these are different from Debugger Evasion tactics.
   - The sequence described in the report (Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Command and Control) does not include Debugger Evasion as a step before establishing command and control.
   - Given the sophistication of the campaign, it is possible that Debugger Evasion tactics could be used, but the report does not provide evidence to support this.
