### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with the delivery of an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various VBScripts and batch files were executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scripts were heavily obfuscated, and 'stopedge.bat' managed the deletion of 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution.
   - **Discovery:** 'versioninfo.bat' collected information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** 'versioninfo.bat' prepared collected information for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicated with the C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that persistence will be established using kernel modules such as those employed by Drovorub or Skidmap after 'stopedge.bat' manages the deletion of files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence in the CTI Report:** The report mentions that 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' exists. This indicates a form of persistence, but it is achieved through a scheduled task, not through kernel modules.
   - **Kernel Modules (Drovorub, Skidmap):** These are advanced techniques typically used by sophisticated APT groups to maintain persistence at a low level, often involving rootkits and kernel-level modifications. The CTI report does not mention any use of kernel modules or rootkits.
   - **Contextual Information:** The Konni APT Group is known for using spear-phishing and malicious documents, and their primary techniques involve script-based attacks and file management, not kernel-level persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run periodically, which is a form of persistence.
   - However, the report does not mention any use of kernel modules or rootkits.
   - The group's known tactics and techniques are more aligned with script-based attacks and file management, not advanced kernel-level persistence.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the Konni APT Group would use kernel modules such as those employed by Drovorub or Skidmap for persistence in this attack.
