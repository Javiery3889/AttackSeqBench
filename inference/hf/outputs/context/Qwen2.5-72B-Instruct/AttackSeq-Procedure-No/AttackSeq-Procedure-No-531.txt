### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
     - They use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server.
     - Subsequent spear-phishing emails with MS Word or PowerPoint documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352.
     - Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a malicious PowerPoint document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
     - Encoded blobs are downloaded and decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Encoded blobs are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
     - This method helps evade detection.
   - **Collection:**
     - The file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
     - Resilient communications are used, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to evade defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware after iterating through password stores and stealing the user's Google Chrome credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the CTI Report:**
     - The backdoor uses encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
     - This method is explicitly mentioned as a technique for defense evasion.
   - **Context of the Question:**
     - The question mentions iterating through password stores and stealing Google Chrome credentials.
     - This activity is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI report, but it is a common technique used by threat actors to gain further access and maintain persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the backdoor uses encoded blobs to download additional malware, which is a method of defense evasion.
   - The question's context of stealing credentials is a plausible next step in the attack sequence, as it would help the threat actor maintain persistence and gain deeper access to the victim's system.
   - The use of encoded blobs and PowerShell scripts to download additional malware is a consistent and effective method for evading defenses, as described in the report.
