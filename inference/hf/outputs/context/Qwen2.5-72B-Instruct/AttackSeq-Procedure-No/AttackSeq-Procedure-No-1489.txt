### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with an infected Excel document exploiting CVE-2014-4114 in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed through a Visual Basic macro, which reassembles and runs a PE32 executable (vba_macro.exe). This executable drops FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, and then deletes itself.
   - **Persistence:** FONTCACHE.DAT is registered to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various anti-debugging techniques.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The malware is designed to move laterally and send data to servers in major European ISPs.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP, sending localization and keyboard layout information.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware functions as a network sniffer and exfiltrates data to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 will send network information to C2 servers located in European ISPs only before using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API to gather network information for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report confirms that FONTCACHE.DAT is registered to the startup shell using the RegSetValueExw() function.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report states that the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP and sends localization and keyboard layout information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the malware is designed for lateral movement and sends data to servers in major European ISPs.
   - **Network Information Gathering:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of the GetAdaptersInfo() function API. However, it is implied that the malware gathers network information for lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not specify the exact sequence of actions regarding the use of the GetAdaptersInfo() function API. However, it is logical to assume that the malware would gather network information before or during lateral movement.
   - The report does mention that the malware sends data to C2 servers in European ISPs, but it does not specify that this happens only before gathering network information.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the malware and its design for lateral movement, it is more likely that the malware would gather network information as part of its routine operations, not necessarily only before sending data to C2 servers.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
