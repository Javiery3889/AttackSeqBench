### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT28 scans for new targets, focusing on Ukraine and Spain, using a distributed network of bots.
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The second stage component is installed by a dropper, which writes key components to the disk and deploys tools.
   - **Persistence:** APT28 changes file timestamps to hide files.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT28 uses a tool to exploit a vulnerability and gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** APT28 uses a password dumping tool based on mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** APT28 scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems.
   - **Collection:** APT28 collects data using modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** APT28 communicates with C&C servers via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption using 3DES and RSA.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that APT28 uses pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server. However, it does not explicitly state whether APT28 divides files if they exceed a certain size.
   - **Targeting:** The report focuses on APT28's activities in Ukraine and Spain, particularly during a political summit. It does not specifically mention targeting the aerospace industry.
   - **File Size Handling:** The report does not provide details on how APT28 handles large files during the collection phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **File Division:** While it is a common practice in malware to divide large files to avoid detection and ensure successful transmission, the report does not provide specific evidence that APT28 does this.
   - **Targeting Specific Industries:** The report focuses on political targets in Ukraine and Spain, but does not mention the aerospace industry. This suggests that while APT28 may target political figures, the specific mention of the aerospace industry is not supported by the report.

### Final Answer
Given the lack of specific evidence in the report regarding file division for large files and the absence of mention of the aerospace industry, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
