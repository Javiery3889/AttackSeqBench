### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a phishing campaign targeting Portuguese users.
     - The emails mimic the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax and contain links to download a zip file.
     - The zip file, when extracted, reveals a VBScript file acting as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Lampion trojan creates a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder to ensure it runs every time the victim's computer starts.
     - An additional VBS file is created to execute the trojan upon system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The trojan uses anti-debug and anti-VM techniques.
     - It is protected by VMProtect 3.x and includes junk data to hinder detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The trojan communicates with a C2 server to send collected data, including disk details, opened windows, clipboard, and banking credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Lampion's phishing emails will execute payloads via shell scripting instead of downloading and running 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip' before achieving persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a VBScript file, not shell scripting.
     - The VBScript file acts as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report specifies that the trojan achieves persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder and an additional VBS file.
   - **Payload Execution:**
     - The report does not mention 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip' specifically, but it does mention that the VBScript file downloads and runs the Lampion trojan.
     - The use of a VBScript file for downloading and running the trojan aligns with the described behavior.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the initial access and payload execution are achieved through a VBScript file, not shell scripting.
   - The persistence mechanism involves creating a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder and an additional VBS file, which aligns with the report's details.
   - There is no mention of shell scripting in the report, and the described behavior does not suggest a deviation from the VBScript-based approach.
