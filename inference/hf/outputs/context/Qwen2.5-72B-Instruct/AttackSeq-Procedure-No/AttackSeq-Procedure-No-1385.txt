### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Persistence:** They use trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** They use LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** They use native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies, application layer protocols, and web shells for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK to establish a foothold. This indicates that initial access is a primary step in their attack sequence.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries and SIXPACK for persistence, but this is typically done after gaining initial access to ensure they can maintain a presence in the network.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The logical sequence of actions for FIN13 is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
     2. **Persistence:** Use trojanized KeePass binaries and SIXPACK to maintain access.
     3. **Privilege Escalation:** Use tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to gain higher privileges.
     4. **Defense Evasion:** Use passive backdoors and legitimate utilities to avoid detection.
     5. **Credential Access:** Harvest credentials using various techniques.
     6. **Discovery:** Gather information about the network and hosts.
     7. **Lateral Movement:** Move laterally within the network.
     8. **Collection:** Collect sensitive data.
     9. **Command and Control:** Establish and maintain C2.
     10. **Exfiltration:** Steal data for fraudulent transactions.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the attack sequence described in the CTI report, it is not likely that FIN13 will exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware for initial access only after using other methods to establish persistence. The initial access is a crucial first step, and persistence methods are used to maintain that access over time.

**Final Answer: B: No**
