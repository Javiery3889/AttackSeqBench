### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance:**
  - **Masscan:** Used to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
  - **Shodan and Censys:** Specialized search engines used to find publicly available resources of medical organizations.
  - **Discovery of Non-Trivial Ports and Services:** Identified Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

- **Others:**
  - **Threats to Medical Networks:** Over 60% of medical organizations had malware on their servers or computers in 2017.
  - **Targeting of Pharmaceutical Organizations:** APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.
  - **Recommendations:** Remove medical data nodes from public access, update software, and avoid connecting expensive equipment to the main LAN.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:** After discovering various services on medical network perimeters, including outdated systems and medical devices, as part of network service discovery, is it likely that entry points into medical infrastructure will be identified using tools like masscan, Shodan, and Censys during reconnaissance?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance Tools:**
  - The CTI report explicitly mentions the use of masscan, Shodan, and Censys for identifying potential entry points and discovering non-trivial ports and services.
  - These tools are used to find publicly available resources and extract IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords, which aligns with the question's context of discovering various services on medical network perimeters.

- **Discovery of Services:**
  - The report highlights the discovery of Building Management systems and printers with web interfaces without authentication, which are examples of non-trivial ports and services that can be exploited.
  - This discovery is a direct result of using the mentioned reconnaissance tools.

- **Contextual Information:**
  - The report provides additional context about the threats to medical networks and the targeting of pharmaceutical organizations, which supports the likelihood of using these tools for reconnaissance.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report clearly states that masscan, Shodan, and Censys are used to identify potential entry points and discover non-trivial ports and services on medical network perimeters.
  - The discovery of outdated systems and medical devices is a direct outcome of using these tools.
  - The additional context about the threats and recommendations further supports the use of these tools for reconnaissance.

- **Final Answer:**
  - Final Answer: A: Yes
