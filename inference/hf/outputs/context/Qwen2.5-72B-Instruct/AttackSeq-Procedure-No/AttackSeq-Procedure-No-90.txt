### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Executes via a service (T1569.002)
     - Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
     - Can timestomp files (T1070.006)
     - Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
     - Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
     - Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)
   - **Collection:**
     - Compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002)
     - Collects files from the computer (T1005)
     - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025)
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
     - Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
     - Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)
   - **Others:**
     - Targeted deployment, shares code similarities with NukeSped, and has been active since December 2018.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva will enumerate all users and their roles from a victim's main treasury system as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The installer creates a new service for persistence (T1543.003).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Decrypts strings and components (T1140).
   - **Collection:**
     - Compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002).
     - Collects files from the computer (T1005).
     - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025).

   - **Discovery:**
     - The CTI report does not mention any specific TTPs related to enumerating users and their roles from a victim's main treasury system. The report focuses on file collection and exfiltration, but not on detailed user enumeration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by Vyveva, including execution, persistence, defense evasion, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - The report does not mention any TTPs related to user enumeration or role discovery.
   - The collection activities described in the report are focused on file collection and exfiltration, not on detailed user information.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
