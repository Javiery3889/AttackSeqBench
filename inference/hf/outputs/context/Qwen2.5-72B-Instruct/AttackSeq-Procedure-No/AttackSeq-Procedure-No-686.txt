### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries use scanning tools like masscan and public search engines to find misconfigurations and vulnerable hosts.
   - **Resource Development:** Attackers use compromised websites and domains for C2 servers and to store malicious files.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports and typo-squatting of popular software to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Use of command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands and scripts.
   - **Persistence:** Techniques like LD_PRELOAD and creation of new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Use of hostPath mount and chroot to gain persistence on the host.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Removal of security software and use of obfuscation techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** Collection of credentials using open-source tools and creation of hidden user accounts.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites for C2 communication.
   - **Impact:** Mainly cryptocurrency mining, with emerging objectives like backdoors and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server after establishing contact with C2 servers by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communication:** The report clearly states that attackers use C2 servers for command and control, including downloading malicious code and establishing communication.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The report mentions that data encoding is used to compile binary files from decoded snippets in the entry point, and C2 servers are used to download shell scripts. However, it does not specifically mention the use of FTP or SMTP for exfiltration.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report emphasizes the use of C2 servers and proxy tools for lateral movement and data exfiltration, suggesting that these are the primary methods used by the attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **C2 Server Usage:** The report indicates that C2 servers are a central part of the attack sequence, used for downloading malicious code and maintaining control over the compromised systems.
   - **Data Exfiltration Methods:** While the report does not explicitly rule out the use of FTP or SMTP, it does not provide any evidence that these protocols are preferred or even used for exfiltration.
   - **Primary Attack Objectives:** The main objectives of the attacks, as described, are cryptocurrency mining and backdoor creation, which are typically facilitated through C2 servers for ongoing control and data exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Given the emphasis on C2 servers and the lack of evidence supporting the use of FTP or SMTP for exfiltration, it is unlikely that attackers will exfiltrate AWS credentials over FTP or SMTP protocols instead of the C2 server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
