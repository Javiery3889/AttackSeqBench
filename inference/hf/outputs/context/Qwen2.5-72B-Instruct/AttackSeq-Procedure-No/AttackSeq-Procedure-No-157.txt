### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware to establish a foothold and performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 achieves persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - **Collection:** APT10 identifies systems of interest and stages data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement before conducting internal reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 gains initial access through spear phishing emails.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** APT10 performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.

   According to the CTI report, APT10 performs internal reconnaissance after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold. The report does not explicitly state that APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement before conducting internal reconnaissance. Instead, it suggests that internal reconnaissance is a step taken after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 sends spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware to establish a foothold.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** APT10 performs internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.

   Based on the sequence described in the CTI report, APT10 is more likely to perform internal reconnaissance after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold, rather than leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement before conducting internal reconnaissance.
