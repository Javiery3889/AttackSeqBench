### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Attackers used compromised websites to store malicious files.
     - Used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Built files on the host from base64.
     - Created public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - Conducted a massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI.
   - **Execution:**
     - Abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands.
     - Used cron utility to schedule local jobs.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software.
     - Used obfuscated files or information.
     - Executed fileless malware attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives include backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance only after deploying malicious containers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance.
     - However, it does mention the use of open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report indicates that the initial access was achieved by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers would likely perform reconnaissance to understand the environment and identify further targets.
     - The use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance is a plausible step, but it is not explicitly stated in the report.
   - **Timing:**
     - The question asks if the reconnaissance using DOCKERGEDDON would occur only after deploying malicious containers.
     - The report does not provide a clear sequence of actions that would confirm this specific timing.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved by exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports.
   - After gaining access, it is logical for attackers to perform reconnaissance to understand the environment.
   - The use of tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance is a plausible step, but it is not explicitly stated in the report.
   - The report does not provide a clear sequence that confirms reconnaissance using DOCKERGEDDON only after deploying malicious containers.
   - Given the nature of the attack, it is more likely that reconnaissance would occur before or during the deployment of malicious containers to ensure the environment is suitable for the attack.

### Final Answer: B: No

The report does not provide evidence to support the claim that reconnaissance using tools like DOCKERGEDDON would occur only after deploying malicious containers. It is more likely that reconnaissance would occur before or during the deployment to ensure the environment is suitable for the attack.
