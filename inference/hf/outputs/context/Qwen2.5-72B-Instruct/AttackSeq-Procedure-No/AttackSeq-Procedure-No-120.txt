### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - LYCEUM gained initial access by using account credentials obtained through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - They sent spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - LYCEUM executed the DanBot malware, which is a first-stage remote access trojan (RAT) that uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms.
     - The malware provides basic remote access capabilities, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe` and to upload and download files.
     - They also used a PowerShell-based keylogger (kl.ps1), a script to decrypt passwords from the RDCMan configuration file (Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1), and a script to gather account information from Active Directory (Get-LAPSP.ps1).
   - **Credential Access:**
     - LYCEUM deployed tools such as Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 to decrypt passwords stored in the RDCMan configuration file and Get-LAPSP.ps1 to gather account information from Active Directory.
   - **Discovery:**
     - LYCEUM targeted HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to compromise accounts that could yield information and access for further spearphishing operations.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - LYCEUM registered new domains for individual campaigns, which were typically used within a few weeks of registration. These domains often had a security or web technology theme.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot for execution of arbitrary commands via `cmd.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that LYCEUM gained initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks and delivered DanBot via spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments.
     - DanBot is described as a Windows-based malware that uses `cmd.exe` for execution of arbitrary commands.
   - **Clearing Logs:**
     - The report does not mention any activities related to clearing logs on Linux or Mac systems.
     - The focus of the report is on Windows-based activities, such as using `cmd.exe` and PowerShell scripts.
   - **Context:**
     - The threat group's primary targets and activities are described in the context of Windows environments, particularly in the oil and gas sector in the Middle East.
     - There is no indication that LYCEUM has a significant presence or interest in Linux or Mac systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Delivery:**
     - LYCEUM gains access through password spraying or brute-force attacks and delivers DanBot via spearphishing emails.
   - **Execution:**
     - DanBot is a Windows-based malware that uses `cmd.exe` for execution.
   - **Log Clearing:**
     - The report does not mention any activities related to clearing logs on non-Windows systems.
     - Given the focus on Windows-based activities, it is unlikely that LYCEUM would clear Linux or Mac system logs before utilizing DanBot.
