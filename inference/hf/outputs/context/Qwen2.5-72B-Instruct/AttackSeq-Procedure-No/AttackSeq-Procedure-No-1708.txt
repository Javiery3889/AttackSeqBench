### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Black Energy 2 uses encryption and code compression to hide its code from antivirus products.
- It infects system processes and allocates virtual memory.
- It copies its decryptor code and passes control to the decryptor.
- A decryptor driver with a random name is created in the system32drivers directory.
- A corresponding service is started.
- The driver acts as a wrapper for the malware's core components.

**Persistence:**
- Black Energy 2 maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe user-mode process.
- The infector driver locates the svchost.exe process, allocates memory in its address space, and launches the injected library's code using APC queue processing.

**Command and Control:**
- The botnet's C&C center communicates with Black Energy 2 through HTTP requests.
- The bot sends a preformed HTTP request containing data that identifies the infected machine.
- The C&C responds with a bot configuration file, which is an encrypted XML document.
- The bot can receive general commands from the C&C, such as downloading and executing files, updating the bot, and setting contact frequency with the C&C server.

**Impact:**
- Black Energy 2 is primarily used to conduct DDoS attacks.
- It uses plugins like ddos, syn, and http to initiate mass connections and send random data packets to target servers.
- The malware can create a significant load on servers, especially when using the http plugin, which imitates an ordinary user visiting a page multiple times in a short period.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky Lab has identified over 4,000 modifications of Black Energy 2 since mid-2008.
- The malware has evolved to include plugins that extend its capabilities beyond DDoS attacks, potentially allowing for spam distribution, credential grabbing, and proxy server setup.
- Kaspersky Lab continues to monitor the evolution of Black Energy 2 and its plugins to track the threat's progression.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that Black Energy 2 will:
- Mount and bind to the `/proc/` filepath on the victim system to enable subsequent operation in memory.
- Remove on-disk artifacts after evading defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Mount and Bind to `/proc/` Filepath:**
- The CTI report does not mention any activity related to mounting or binding to the `/proc/` filepath. This is a Linux-specific feature, and the report primarily describes Windows-based activities.

**Remove On-Disk Artifacts:**
- The report mentions that Black Energy 2 uses encryption and code compression to hide its code from antivirus products. However, it does not explicitly state that it removes on-disk artifacts after evading defenses.

**Loading Plugins Directly:**
- The report mentions that Black Energy 2 can download and execute files and use plugins, but it does not specify that these plugins are loaded directly onto the infected machine without leaving any on-disk artifacts.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not provide any evidence that Black Energy 2 mounts and binds to the `/proc/` filepath, which is a Linux-specific feature.
- The report mentions encryption and code compression but does not explicitly state the removal of on-disk artifacts.
- The report does mention the use of plugins, but it does not specify that these plugins are loaded directly without leaving any on-disk artifacts.

Given the lack of evidence for the specific activities mentioned in the question, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
