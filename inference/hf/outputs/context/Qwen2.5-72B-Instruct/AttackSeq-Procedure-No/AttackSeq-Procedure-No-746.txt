### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Execution**: The attack starts with a malicious document containing macro code that, when executed, drops a Crimson RAT downloader. This downloader then fetches the fully functional Crimson RAT from the IP address 151.106.19[.]207:8246.
- **Persistence**: The downloader drops the Crimson RAT to the path 'C:\ProgramData\Hurmz\bahgrtmrs.exe'.
- **Defense Evasion**: The payload can kill any process running in the system.
- **Credential Access**: The Crimson RAT can perform keylogging and browser credential theft.
- **Command and Control**: The payload communicates with the C&C server and supports various commands, including listing processes, antiviruses, file info, downloading files, updating the binary, and sending disk drive lists. It can also send files to the C&C server.
- **Others**: The report mentions a similar attack in August 2018 and links it to the APT group behind 'Operation Transparent Tribe', which has a history of targeting Indian officials.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks whether it is likely that the attack will involve the use of social media channels to deliver malicious files to victims before downloading a Crimson RAT from the specified IP address.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Infection Vector**: The CTI report clearly states that the initial infection vector is a malicious document containing macro code, not social media channels.
- **Sequence of Events**: The report describes a sequence where the malicious document is opened, the macro code executes, and the Crimson RAT is downloaded from the specified IP address.
- **Historical Context**: The report mentions a similar attack in August 2018, which also used a malicious document (XLS file) with macro code, not social media.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Infection Vector**: The CTI report explicitly states that the initial infection vector is a malicious document with macro code. There is no mention of social media being used to deliver the malicious files.
2. **Historical Consistency**: The historical context provided in the report (the August 2018 attack) also uses a malicious document with macro code, reinforcing the pattern of using documents rather than social media.
3. **Attack Sequence**: The sequence of events described in the report (document execution, macro code, payload download) does not include any step involving social media.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
