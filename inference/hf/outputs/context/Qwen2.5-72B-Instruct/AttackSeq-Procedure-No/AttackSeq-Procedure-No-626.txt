### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
- SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
- Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

**Execution:**
- Malicious code was executed through various methods.
- 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
- 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).

**Defense Evasion:**
- Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.
- Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

**Discovery:**
- SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
- Network service scanning using tools like pscan and nmap.

**Collection:**
- SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.

**Command and Control:**
- SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
- C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
- RSA encryption for AES key exchange.
- Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, is it likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over HTTPS or SMTPS using a non-C2 protocol?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The SombRAT backdoor uses protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP for C2 communication.
- The traffic is SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
- The C2 domain name is hardcoded and obfuscated.
- RSA encryption is used for AES key exchange.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that the SombRAT backdoor uses DNS and HTTP for C2 communication, and the traffic is SSL-encrypted.
- There is no mention of the backdoor using HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration.
- The use of DNS and HTTP for C2 communication suggests that the attackers have already established a reliable and secure method for communication and data exfiltration.
- Using a non-C2 protocol like HTTPS or SMTPS would be less likely, as it would introduce additional complexity and potential detection risks.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The SombRAT backdoor is designed to use DNS and HTTP for C2 communication, which are already secure and reliable.
- The report does not indicate any use of HTTPS or SMTPS for data exfiltration.
- Using a non-C2 protocol would be less likely due to the established and secure methods already in place.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
