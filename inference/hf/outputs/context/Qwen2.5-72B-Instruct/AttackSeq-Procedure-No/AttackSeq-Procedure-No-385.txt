### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Execution:**
  - APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
  - RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.
  - RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output, and installs persistently.

- **Persistence:**
  - RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.

- **Defense Evasion:**
  - RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.

- **Credential Access:**
  - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

- **Collection:**
  - APT15 used tools like CSVDE to export data from Microsoft Windows Active Directory and BCP from Microsoft SQL to export data from databases.
  - They also used bespoke tools to extract information from Microsoft Sharepoint and Microsoft Exchange.

- **Others:**
  - NCC Group tracked APT15's movements over more than a year by decoding over 200 commands from several compromised hosts.
  - Ahmed Zaki, a senior malware researcher at NCC Group, highlighted the sophistication of APT15 and the importance of knowledge sharing in the security industry.
  - The article was published on 10 March 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

- **Question:**
  - After APT15 deployed backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS while leveraging RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution, is it likely that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely?

- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Sequence of TTPs in the CTI Report:**
  1. **Execution:**
     - Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
     - RoyalCLI bypasses command prompt policy settings.
  2. **Persistence:**
     - RoyalDNS installs persistently.
  3. **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
  4. **Defense Evasion:**
     - RoyalCLI evades command prompt policy settings.
  5. **Credential Access:**
     - Used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
     - Stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
  6. **Collection:**
     - Used various tools to extract data from different sources.

- **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
  - Deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).
  - Leveraged RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings.
  - Used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
  - Stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials (Privilege Escalation and Credential Access).
  - The report also mentions that APT15 stole a VPN certificate for remote network access (Credential Access).
  - The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the sequence described in the CTI report, particularly the use of Mimikatz and the theft of the VPN certificate.

- **Final Answer:**
  - Final Answer: A: Yes
