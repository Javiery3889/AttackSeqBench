### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows) to bypass User Account Control and install the Nidiran back door.
   - **Execution:** Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools to infect internal hosts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze and used encrypted communication with C&C domains.
   - **Discovery:** Suckfly scanned the internal network for hosts with open ports 8080, 5900, and 40.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Suckfly used hacktools to move laterally and escalate privileges within the network.
   - **Command and Control:** Suckfly's Nidiran back door communicated with C&C domains.
   - **Exfiltration:** Suckfly exfiltrated data using the Nidiran back door.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Suckfly is likely to gather unsecured credentials for Azure AD services, such as Azure AD Connect, from a local machine before using hacktools to move laterally within the e-commerce company's internal network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Suckfly scanned the internal network for hosts with open ports 8080, 5900, and 40. This indicates that Suckfly was looking for potential expansion points within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that Suckfly used hacktools to move laterally and escalate privileges within the network.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The report mentions that Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials. However, it does not specify the type of credentials or the services from which they were obtained.
   - **Azure AD Services:** The report does not mention any specific activities related to Azure AD services or Azure AD Connect.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that Suckfly specifically targeted or gathered credentials for Azure AD services.
   - The focus of the report is on the general process of scanning the network, obtaining credentials, and moving laterally.
   - While it is possible that Suckfly could have targeted Azure AD services, the report does not provide any specific information to support this.
