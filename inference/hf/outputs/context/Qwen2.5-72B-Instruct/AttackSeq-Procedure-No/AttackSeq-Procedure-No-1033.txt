### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
   - **Collection:** APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will compress proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR in the Collection phase only after using custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employing cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - According to the CTI report, the sequence of events is as follows:
     1. **Collection:** APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR.
     2. **Exfiltration:** APT10 exfiltrated the compressed data to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - The report clearly states that the data was compressed using WinRAR before it was exfiltrated to Dropbox. This indicates that the compression step (Collection) occurred before the exfiltration step (Exfiltration).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will compress the data only after exfiltration. Based on the CTI report, this is not the case. The data was compressed before exfiltration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
