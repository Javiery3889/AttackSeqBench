### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` at `/system/bin/netd` and executing the legitimate process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** Infamous Chisel scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information, and deploys `tcpdump` to sniff network traffic.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to SSH.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** The malware replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services before enumerating system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that Infamous Chisel deploys `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the malware exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention the enumeration of system data directories and GPS information. However, the collection of files from application and data directories containing communication data suggests that some form of discovery is performed.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question is:
     1. Deploy `tcpdump` to scrape credential-containing files (Credential Access).
     2. Automatically exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services (Exfiltration).
     3. Enumerate system data directories and GPS information to facilitate Discovery.
   - The CTI report confirms the first two steps:
     - **Credential Access:** Deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credentials.
     - **Exfiltration:** Automatically exfiltrating files using Tor hidden services.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the enumeration of system data directories and GPS information, but it does mention the collection of files from application and data directories, which is a form of discovery.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information in the CTI report, the most plausible sequence is that Infamous Chisel would exfiltrate the collected files using Tor hidden services after deploying `tcpdump` to scrape credentials. The enumeration of system data directories and GPS information is not explicitly mentioned but is implied by the collection of files from application and data directories.
   - Therefore, the answer is: **B: No**.

Final Answer: B: No
