### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- An email with a seemingly innocuous PDF attachment was sent to Susan, a secretary at Black Gold.
- The PDF, which passed through all security filters, was actually an executable file disguised as a document, initiating the attack when opened.

**Execution:**
- The executable file created a folder and extracted six files.
- 'stat.vbs' was executed, which in turn ran 'deca.bat'.
- 'deca.bat' opened a blank PDF and ran 'dcp.exe' to decrypt two files and extract the contents of 'bare.zip' into a different folder.
- 'sai.vbs' script was then executed.

**Persistence:**
- The attack modified the Windows registry to ensure 'aagi.bat' ran at system start.
- Legitimate applications were used to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection.
- An application was configured to run another batch file every hour to maintain its operations.

**Credential Access:**
- Legitimate applications were used to collect credentials from local mail clients and Internet browsers, saving them to text files.
- These credentials were then uploaded to an external FTP server controlled by the attackers.

**Collection:**
- The attack collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials from various firms, all within the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.

**Command and Control:**
- The attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server.
- The 'iei.bat' file was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of the data.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013, indicating the long-term undetected nature of the attack.

**Others:**
- The attack, dubbed 'Phantom Menace', targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.
- It was linked to a scam involving fake oil deals, where stolen credentials were likely used to forge documents for fraudulent transactions.
- The attackers appeared to be based in Nigeria, with connections to Ikeja, known as the 'Computer Village'.
- Despite the evidence, victims were unwilling to report the crime, hindering police investigations.
- The case highlights the need for companies to perform regular audits and implement new protection strategies for network security.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Is it likely that the attack evaded detection by using legitimate tools and scripts for its operations only before initiating by sending a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Yes
B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack started with a PDF attachment that passed through security filters and appeared benign.
- The attack used legitimate tools and scripts (e.g., 'stat.vbs', 'deca.bat', 'dcp.exe', 'sai.vbs', 'aagi.bat', 'iei.bat') for its operations.
- The attack maintained persistence and collected credentials recurrently, indicating a long-term, undetected nature.

**Evaluation:**
- The attack used a PDF attachment that appeared benign to initiate the attack, which is a common technique to evade initial detection.
- The use of legitimate tools and scripts (e.g., batch files, VBScripts) is a known method to blend in with normal system operations and avoid detection by security software.
- The long-term nature of the attack, with credentials being collected and exfiltrated over a period of years, suggests that the use of legitimate tools and scripts was effective in evading detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The attack started with a PDF attachment that appeared benign and passed through security filters, which is a common initial access technique.
2. The attack used legitimate tools and scripts for its operations, which is a known method to evade detection by blending in with normal system activities.
3. The long-term, undetected nature of the attack, with credentials being collected and exfiltrated over a period of years, indicates that the use of legitimate tools and scripts was effective in evading detection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
