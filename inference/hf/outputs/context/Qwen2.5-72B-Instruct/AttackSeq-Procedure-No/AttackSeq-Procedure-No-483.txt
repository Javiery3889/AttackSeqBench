### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera, which are internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** FamousSparrow created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. They also used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FamousSparrow injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** SparrowDoor read file contents and exfiltrated them.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for Initial Access after running cmd.exe commands to execute SparrowDoor and communicating with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report clearly states that FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera, which are internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** The report mentions that FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The report indicates that SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server over an encrypted HTTPS channel.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report aligns with the question. FamousSparrow first exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications to gain Initial Access. Then, they used cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor, which communicated with the C&C server over an encrypted HTTPS channel.
   - The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access, which is consistent with the information provided in the CTI report.
