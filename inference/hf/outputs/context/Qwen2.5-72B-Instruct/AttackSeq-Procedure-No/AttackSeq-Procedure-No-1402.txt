### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil.
   - **Credential Access:** Process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Collection:** Data from network shared drives, archived using utilities and libraries.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not mention the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy for lateral movement. Instead, it focuses on web shells and custom backdoors for movement and persistence.
   - **Collection:** The report states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Ransomware:** The report explicitly states that FIN13 has not deployed ransomware and remains focused on traditional cybercrime, which includes fraudulent transactions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance, which aligns with the question.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not indicate the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy. Instead, they use web shells and custom backdoors for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives, which aligns with the question.
   - **Ransomware:** The report clearly states that FIN13 does not use ransomware like AvosLocker. They focus on traditional cybercrime, including fraudulent transactions.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most plausible sequence of TTPs does not include the use of software deployment tools like PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
