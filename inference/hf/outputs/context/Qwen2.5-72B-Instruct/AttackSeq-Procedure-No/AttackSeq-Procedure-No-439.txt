### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
   - **Execution:**
     - The HTA file contained a script that checked for installed antivirus software using WMI.
     - If no antivirus software was detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WinSrv.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The HTA file communicated with the C2 server to send information about the installed antivirus software. The domain used for C2 communication was webserv-redir.net.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Sidewinder is likely to employ DLL sideloading to execute Srvstr.exe for defense evasion before using the HTA file to check for antivirus software using WMI and communicate with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DLL Sideloading:**
     - The report does not mention DLL sideloading as a technique used by Sidewinder in this attack.
     - The backdoor (FinalBot.exe) was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe, but there is no indication that DLL sideloading was used to execute it.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The HTA file first checks for installed antivirus software using WMI.
     - If no antivirus software is detected, it proceeds to run the backdoor.
     - The backdoor then establishes persistence and communicates with the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the HTA file checks for antivirus software using WMI before running the backdoor.
   - The backdoor is executed directly after the antivirus check, and there is no mention of DLL sideloading in the process.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report does not include DLL sideloading as a step before the antivirus check and C2 communication.

### Final Answer
