### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Deployed loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) which established persistence via a registry key.
     - Attempted to disable specific antivirus processes.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
     - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placed a copy of the loader/spreader malware in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Set a registry key for automatic execution.
     - Attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Killed specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command line tool.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
     - Packed backdoor malware with Themida to evade analysis and detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Copied the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
     - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses, targeting active and responding devices.
     - Established connections to SMB shares using provided credentials.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote C&C servers.
     - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number.
     - Polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute, maintaining a communication session and executing remote commands as directed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group established command and control communication by utilizing backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to poll remote C&C servers for tasks and execute commands after deploying Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leaving ransom notes in encrypted directories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the Lazarus group used backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) to communicate with remote C&C servers.
   - The backdoor malware was designed to poll the remote C&C for tasks and execute commands as directed.
   - The report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware, but it is reasonable to infer that the group would use the same C&C infrastructure for different stages of the attack, including the deployment of ransomware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus group has a history of using backdoor malware to maintain control over compromised systems.
   - The backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) is specifically designed to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands.
   - The deployment of Hermes ransomware is a later stage of the attack, and it is logical that the group would use the established C&C infrastructure to manage this stage as well.
   - The use of C&C communication is a common tactic in multi-stage attacks to maintain control and execute further actions.
