### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Gallmaker group initiated the attack by delivering malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails.
- These documents exploited the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands in memory, avoiding leaving artifacts on disk.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Gallmaker used living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available hack tools.
- They deleted tools from victim machines after use to avoid detection.
- Exploited the DDE protocol to execute code remotely without leaving artifacts on disk.

**Command and Control:**
- Used three primary IP addresses for C&C infrastructure.
- Likely used the WinZip console to archive data for exfiltration.

**Exfiltration:**
- Used the legitimate version of the WinZip console to archive data for exfiltration.

**Others:**
- Targeted government, military, and defense sectors.
- Active since December 2017, with recent activity in June 2018.
- Indicative of a cyber espionage campaign, likely state-sponsored.
- Symantec's TAA technology detected their activities.
- Protections include System Infected: Meterpreter Reverse TCP and W97M.Downloader.
- IoCs and Yara rules are shared for detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After adopting living off the land (LotL) tactics for defense evasion, is it likely that Gallmaker will utilize tools such as WindowsRoamingToolsTask and the reverse_tcp payload for execution only after exploiting the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to gain initial access?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- Gallmaker uses DDE to execute commands in memory, gaining initial access.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Gallmaker uses LotL tactics and publicly available tools to avoid detection.
- They delete tools after use to avoid leaving traces.

**Execution:**
- The question asks if Gallmaker will use tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask and reverse_tcp payload for execution after gaining initial access.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of WindowsRoamingToolsTask or reverse_tcp payload.
- However, the use of LotL tactics and publicly available tools suggests that Gallmaker might use a variety of tools for execution, including those that are less likely to be detected.

**Context:**
- The report emphasizes the use of LotL tactics and the deletion of tools to avoid detection.
- The use of reverse_tcp payload is a common technique for maintaining a persistent connection, which aligns with the C&C and exfiltration activities described.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- Gallmaker uses DDE to gain initial access.
- They adopt LotL tactics to avoid detection, which suggests they might use a variety of tools, including those that are less likely to be detected.
- The use of reverse_tcp payload is a common technique for maintaining a persistent connection, which aligns with their C&C and exfiltration activities.
- While the report does not explicitly mention WindowsRoamingToolsTask, the use of LotL tactics and publicly available tools suggests they might use such tools for execution.

**Final Answer:**
- A: Yes
