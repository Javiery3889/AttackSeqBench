### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app is designed to collect various types of information on an iOS device.
- It can perform the following routines:
  - Collect text messages
  - Get contact lists
  - Get pictures
  - Collect geo-location data
  - Start voice recording
  - Get a list of installed apps
  - Get a list of processes
  - Get the Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the Command and Control (C2) server, is it likely that the malware will collect information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware is designed to collect various types of information, including text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
- This collection is part of the Discovery phase of the attack.

**Base64-encoded Token and C2 Communication:**
- The question mentions the use of a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the C2 server.
- This is a common technique used by malware to securely and uniquely identify itself to the C2 server and to receive commands or modules.

**Relevance to the Discovery Phase:**
- The Discovery phase involves the malware gathering information about the compromised system.
- The CTI report explicitly states that the malware collects text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data, which aligns with the Discovery phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly states that the malware is designed to collect text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data.
2. This collection is part of the Discovery phase of the attack.
3. The use of a Base64-encoded token with a 5-byte random prefix to identify modules while communicating with the C2 server is a common technique for malware to ensure secure and unique communication.
4. The fact that the malware uses this technique does not preclude it from performing the Discovery phase activities described in the report.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
