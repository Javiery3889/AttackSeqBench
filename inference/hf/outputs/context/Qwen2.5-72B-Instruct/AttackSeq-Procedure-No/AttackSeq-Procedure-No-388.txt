### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Execution**: The report describes a new code injection technique called AtomBombing.
- **Mechanism**: AtomBombing leverages atom tables in the Windows operating system to inject malicious code.
- **Impact**: This technique affects all versions of Windows and cannot be patched.
- **Bypass**: It bypasses security solutions like antivirus (AV) and next-generation antivirus (NGAV).

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After executing malicious code by exploiting atom tables in the AtomBombing technique, is it likely that threat actors will use a resource fork to present a macOS JPEG or text file icon rather than the executable's icon assigned by the operating system?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Context**: The CTI report is specific to the Windows operating system and the AtomBombing technique.
- **Resource Fork**: A resource fork is a feature of the macOS file system, not the Windows file system. It is used to store structured data alongside a file's raw data.
- **Icon Manipulation**: The question asks about manipulating the icon of an executable to appear as a macOS JPEG or text file icon. This is not a typical technique used in Windows-based attacks, especially when the focus is on code injection and execution.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Operating System Context**: The AtomBombing technique is specific to Windows and leverages Windows mechanisms (atom tables).
2. **Resource Forks**: Resource forks are a macOS feature and are not relevant to Windows file systems.
3. **Icon Manipulation**: While threat actors might manipulate icons to disguise executables, using a macOS-specific technique to do so on a Windows system is highly unlikely and impractical.
4. **Plausibility**: Given the context of the attack (Windows-based code injection), it is not plausible that threat actors would use a macOS-specific technique to manipulate icons.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
