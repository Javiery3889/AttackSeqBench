### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: North Korean state-sponsored hackers (APT Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA) use spearphishing attacks to obtain retail staff passwords and gain initial access to online stores.
- **Command and Control**: HIDDEN COBRA injects malicious scripts into store checkout pages to intercept transactions. The skimmer waits for customer keystrokes and, upon transaction completion, sends the intercepted data (e.g., credit card numbers) to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After intercepting customer transaction data through malicious scripts injected into store checkout pages, is HIDDEN COBRA likely to use the MIME protocol to exfiltrate collected data from the infected machine to the C2?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Details from the Report**:
  - The skimmer intercepts customer keystrokes and sends the data to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.
  - The method of exfiltration is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the data is sent to a server.

- **MIME Protocol**:
  - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard for formatting messages to include non-ASCII characters, attachments, and other content types. It is commonly used in email and web protocols.
  - While MIME can be used for data exfiltration, it is not the most common or efficient method for exfiltrating data in a web-based skimming operation.

- **Common Exfiltration Methods**:
  - In web-based skimming operations, attackers often use HTTP/HTTPS requests to exfiltrate data directly to a server. This method is more straightforward and less likely to be detected by network security measures compared to using MIME.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The report indicates that the skimmer sends intercepted data to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.
  - Given the nature of web-based skimming, it is more likely that the data is exfiltrated using HTTP/HTTPS requests rather than the MIME protocol.
  - MIME is typically used for email and more complex data formats, which are not necessary for the simple exfiltration of credit card data.

- **Conclusion**:
  - HIDDEN COBRA is unlikely to use the MIME protocol to exfiltrate collected data from the infected machine to the C2.

**Final Answer: B: No**
