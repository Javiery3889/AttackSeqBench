### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Iranian state-backed hackers targeted individuals involved in sanctions against Iran, politicians, activists, and journalists.
- Collected information on targets prior to phishing attacks, tailoring their approach based on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.

**Initial Access:**
- Used phishing attacks through unknown email or social media accounts and compromised accounts of public figures.
- Sent fake security alerts from email addresses like notifications.mailservices@gmail[.]com and noreply.customermails@gmail[.]com, claiming unauthorized access attempts.
- Created fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials.

**Persistence:**
- Did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- Used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images.
- Used a hidden tracking image in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.

**Others:**
- Phishing infrastructure included over 20 domain names set up between September and November 2018.
- Used VPNs and proxies with Dutch and French IP addresses but traced back to real Iranian IP addresses.
- Campaign linked to the Charming Kitten group, known for its connections to the Iranian government.
- Campaign coincides with the U.S. imposing new sanctions on Iran on November 4, 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems, is it likely that the attackers will gather account credentials via a keylogger plugin instead of verifying victims' credentials in real-time and prompting for the 2-step verification code?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- They created fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials.
- They used a hidden tracking image to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.
- They did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to monitor communications in real-time.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This suggests that the attackers will use a keylogger plugin to gather account credentials.
- **B: No** - This suggests that the attackers will not use a keylogger plugin and will instead verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code.

**Reasoning:**
- The report indicates that the attackers used a combination of phishing techniques to trick users into entering their credentials on fake Google Drive download pages.
- The use of a hidden tracking image suggests that the attackers were monitoring the targets' actions in real-time.
- The persistence tactic of not changing the passwords of the victim's accounts further supports the idea that the attackers were monitoring and verifying credentials in real-time.
- The report does not mention the use of keylogger plugins, and the described methods (phishing and real-time monitoring) are more consistent with the tactics outlined in the report.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
