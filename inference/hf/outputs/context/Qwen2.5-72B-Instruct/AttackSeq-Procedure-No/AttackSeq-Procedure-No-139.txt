### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance (July to August 2011):** The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Persistence (February 2014):** The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - **Credential Access (July to August 2011):** The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Command and Control (May 2015):** The attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks. Initial backdoors are relatively simple, but continually forward all SMS messages and call information back to their C2 servers. All identified victims reside in Japan or South Korea.
   - **Others:**
     - March to August 2013: Attack activity greatly subsides, although several new domains that will be used later are registered.
     - October 2011: Attack group attempts to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis by phishing the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi's death, targeting US defense targets.
     - June 2012: Attack campaign leverages previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day.
     - July & October 2015: Two new waves of attacks are launched, targeting multiple Japanese companies including a Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility and a major Japanese oil and gas company. The most likely goals are reconnaissance and long-term espionage.
     - 2016: SPEAR believes that attacks of this nature into companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and likely to continue to escalate in the future.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack group would exploit an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks only after attempting to gather user credentials through phishing domains during the reconnaissance phase, and after securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (July to August 2011):** The group gathered user credentials through phishing domains.
   - **Persistence (February 2014):** The group began securing alternative means of persistence.
   - **Exploitation of Internet Explorer 8 (June 2012):** The group leveraged a previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day.

   The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests the following:
   - The group first gathered user credentials through phishing (Reconnaissance and Credential Access).
   - Later, they secured alternative means of persistence (Persistence).
   - Finally, they exploited an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability (Exploitation).

   The question asks if the group would exploit the vulnerability only after securing persistence and after the initial reconnaissance and credential gathering. Based on the timeline provided in the CTI report, the group did exploit the Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability in June 2012, which is after the initial reconnaissance and credential gathering (July to August 2011) but before securing alternative means of persistence (February 2014).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report does not support the idea that the group would exploit the Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability only after securing alternative means of persistence. The exploitation occurred in June 2012, which is before the persistence was secured in February 2014.

   Therefore, the correct answer is:
   **Final Answer: B: No**
