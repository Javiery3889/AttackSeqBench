### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a dropper malware written in Delphi, which downloads a second stage payload from the internet and executes it.
   - **Execution:** The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is downloaded to '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp' and initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Persistence:** 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper uses evasion techniques, and the malware was patched to reveal its full behavior.
   - **Discovery:** The malware sends system information and process lists to the C2 server using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will discover system information and process lists via the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command, given that it uses HTTPS communication for C2 operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the malware sends system information and process lists to the C2 server using the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 communication is mentioned, but it does not contradict the discovery of system information and process lists.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report aligns with the question, confirming that the malware does indeed use the 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' command for discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report explicitly mentions that the malware uses the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' to gather system information and process lists.
   - This command is part of the discovery phase of the attack, which is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The use of HTTPS for C2 communication is a separate tactic that does not affect the discovery phase.
