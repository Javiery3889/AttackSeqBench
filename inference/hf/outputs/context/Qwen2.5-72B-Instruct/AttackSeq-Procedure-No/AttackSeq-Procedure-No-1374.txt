### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Word document that uses the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code, regardless of whether macros are enabled.
   - **Persistence:** The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure the malware persists on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses, moving away from VBA scripts.
   - **Command and Control:** The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto the victim's system. The control server domain is webviewres[.]net.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that APT28 will use Azure Run Command to execute code on virtual machines before connecting to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and DDE Technique:** The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved using a malicious Word document with the DDE technique.
   - **Command and Control:** The report specifies that the document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader.
   - **Azure Run Command:** The report does not mention any use of Azure Run Command or any activity related to virtual machines. The focus is on the use of DDE, PowerShell, and the control server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a clear sequence of events: initial access via DDE, persistence via batch file and registry entry, and command and control via a control server to drop Seduploader.
   - There is no mention of Azure Run Command or any activity involving virtual machines in the report.
   - Given the detailed and specific nature of the report, it is unlikely that APT28 would use Azure Run Command in this particular attack sequence.
