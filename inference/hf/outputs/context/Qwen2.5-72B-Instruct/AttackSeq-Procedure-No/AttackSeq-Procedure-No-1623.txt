### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers conducted meticulous reconnaissance, understanding the victims' network infrastructure to remain undetected.
     - They targeted Lebanon and the UAE, focusing on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline.
     - They used spear-phishing via email or social media platforms like LinkedIn to distribute malicious Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros, disguised as job postings on fake websites such as hr-wipro[.]com and hr-suncor[.]com.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was attempted through malicious websites hosting job listings, which redirected to legitimate company sites.
     - They distributed malicious Microsoft Office documents via spear-phishing to compromise targets.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware executes in two steps: first, it decodes a PE file encoded with base64 when the document is opened, and second, it renames and executes the file as a scheduled task when the document is closed.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware maintains persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'chromiumupdater v 37.5.0' to execute the dropped binary every minute.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware uses password-protected macros in Microsoft Word to prevent victims from accessing the macro code and employs classical string obfuscation to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware retrieves the infected user's username, hostname, and domain information to understand the environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware uses HTTP and DNS for command and control communication with the C2 server.
   - **Impact:**
     - The DNS redirection part of the campaign could intercept traffic, potentially harvesting email and VPN credentials, and enabling further attacks or blackmail.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the DNSpionage attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the attackers conducted meticulous reconnaissance to understand the victims' network infrastructure and remain undetected.
   - The report also mentions that the attackers targeted specific domains in Lebanon and the UAE, focusing on .gov domains and a private Lebanese airline.
   - The use of spear-phishing via email or social media platforms and the creation of fake websites (hr-wipro[.]com and hr-suncor[.]com) suggest that the attackers had a clear understanding of their targets before launching the attack.
   - The reconnaissance phase is described as being conducted to understand the network infrastructure, which implies that it was done before the actual targeting and exploitation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers needed to understand the network infrastructure and the specific domains they were targeting before they could create and distribute the malicious documents and fake websites.
   - The reconnaissance phase is a critical first step in the attack sequence, allowing the attackers to tailor their approach to the specific targets.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the attackers conducted reconnaissance only after targeting specific domains. Instead, reconnaissance was likely conducted to identify and understand the targets before the attack was launched.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
