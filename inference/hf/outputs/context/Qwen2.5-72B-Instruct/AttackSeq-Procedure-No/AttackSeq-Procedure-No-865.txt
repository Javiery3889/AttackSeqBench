### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email campaign that delivered a URL leading to an IP-address-based URL where the payload was located. The payload included an executable and a decoy PDF.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and began sending commands to gather system information, take screenshots, and execute system commands.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking and registry keys were used for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Files and processes were deleted and security tools were disabled.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumpers were used to target browsers and email clients to retrieve credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Information about the victim's computer and environment was gathered through registry key enumeration and listing running processes.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server used common ports and encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were prepared with file paths and sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group's malware is likely to scan for files matching specific extensions before gathering information about the victim's computer and environment through commands for registry key enumeration and listing running processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data were prepared with all file paths to be exfiltrated. This implies that the malware already has a list of files to exfiltrate.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment, including registry key enumeration and listing running processes.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state that the malware scans for files matching specific extensions before the discovery phase. Instead, it suggests that the data preparation for exfiltration (which includes file paths) happens after the discovery phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The exfiltration process involves preparing a file with all file paths to be exfiltrated. This preparation is likely done after the discovery phase, where the malware has already gathered information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - Scanning for files matching specific extensions is not mentioned as a step that occurs before the discovery phase. Instead, the discovery phase itself involves gathering detailed information about the system, which would include identifying files of interest.
