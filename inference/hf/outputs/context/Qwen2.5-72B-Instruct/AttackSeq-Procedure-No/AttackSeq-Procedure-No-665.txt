### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** They used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket tools).
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used a custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They moved laterally using webshells and Impacket's atexec tool.
   - **Command and Control:** They used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate and run commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery only after moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial System and User Discovery:** The report mentions that the actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands for initial system and user discovery. This suggests that they performed some form of discovery early in the attack.
   - **Lateral Movement and Discovery:** The report states that the actors moved laterally using webshells and Impacket's atexec tool. However, it does not explicitly state that they performed permission groups discovery only after lateral movement.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report indicates that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash before moving laterally. This suggests that they had already gained some level of access and information before moving laterally.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide a clear sequence indicating that permission groups discovery was performed only after lateral movement. Instead, it suggests that initial discovery was done early in the attack.
   - Given the nature of the attack, it is more likely that the actors performed some form of discovery (including permission groups) both before and after lateral movement to gather necessary information and maintain control.
