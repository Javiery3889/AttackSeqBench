### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for further access.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after the discovery phase, it is likely that attackers will taint shared content to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the discovery phase involves exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention tainting shared content as a method for lateral movement. However, lateral movement is a common tactic used to spread to other systems within the network.
   - **Persistence:** The report emphasizes the importance of persistence points to ensure ongoing access to the network. Installing additional persistence points on new systems is a logical step after gaining access to them.

4. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**
   - **Answer A: Yes**
     - This would imply that tainting shared content is a common and likely method for lateral movement before installing persistence points.
   - **Answer B: No**
     - This would imply that tainting shared content is not a common or likely method for lateral movement before installing persistence points.

### Reasoning:
- **Lateral Movement:** While tainting shared content can be a method for lateral movement, it is not the most common or primary method described in the report. The report emphasizes the use of valid credentials and privilege escalation for lateral movement.
- **Persistence:** The report clearly states that persistence points are crucial for ongoing access and are often installed after gaining access to new systems.
- **Sequence of Actions:** The logical sequence after discovery would be to use valid credentials and privilege escalation to move laterally, followed by installing persistence points to ensure continued access.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B: No
