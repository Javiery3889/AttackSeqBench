### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- The malware was a VBScript encoded script hosted under the account 'vbiayay1'.
- When executed, the VBScript downloaded a .doc file and opened it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The campaign utilized multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding.
- The attack was fileless, avoiding known signatures.
- The attack did not originate from the attacker's territory, improving the chances of a successful APT campaign.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicated with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15, a dial-up IP in South Korea.
- The domain used for C2 communication was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.

**Others:**
- The campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI).
- The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code.
- The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.
- The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian.
- The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities.
- The campaign was linked to a larger APT campaign and utilized email addresses 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing.
- The CNC IP address and the email sender addresses are recommended to be blocked and traced.
- The malware files associated with the campaign have been deleted with the help of Yahoo Incident Response Division (YIRD), JP-CERT/CC, and other security professionals in Japan.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website, is it likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution only before the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - APT phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - The malware is a VBScript encoded script.
   - The VBScript downloads a .doc file and opens it.
   - The .doc file leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The VBScript and PowerShell attack use multilayered base64 encoding to avoid detection.
   - The attack is fileless and does not originate from the attacker's territory.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - The malware communicates with a C2 server.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution only before the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution.
  - The CTI report indicates that the VBScript downloads a .doc file and opens it, which then leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack. However, it does not specify that the PowerShell command runs base64 encoded code before the VBScript downloads and opens the .doc file.
  - The report does mention that the attack uses multilayered base64 encoding, but it does not specify the exact sequence of when the base64 encoded code is executed.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the sequence described in Choice A is not likely.
  - The CTI report clearly states that the VBScript downloads and opens a .doc file, which then leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack. It does not indicate that the PowerShell command runs base64 encoded code before the VBScript downloads and opens the .doc file.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report indicates that the VBScript downloads and opens a .doc file, which then leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
- The report does not specify that the PowerShell command runs base64 encoded code before the VBScript downloads and opens the .doc file.
- Therefore, the sequence described in Choice A is not supported by the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
