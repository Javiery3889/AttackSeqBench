### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
- They sent 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails containing a Cozyduke payload to compromise high-profile government networks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
- It is designed to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information such as emails.
- Seaduke communicates with over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.

**Credential Access:**
- The Duke group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell) and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials.

**Collection:**
- Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and securely delete the malware using a self-delete function.

**Command and Control:**
- Seaduke operates by securely communicating with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS with layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES).
- The control infrastructure is distinct, allowing for sub-teams to concurrently exploit the target network.

**Others:**
- The Duke group has been active since 2010, targeting governmental and diplomatic organizations.
- They have a range of malware tools and sophisticated operational capabilities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Duke group uses Seaduke to securely communicate with the command-and-control server employing multiple layers of encryption and encoding for Command and Control, is it likely that they will exfiltrate data over the same channel used for C2?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Seaduke uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation for both C&C and data exfiltration.
- The malware is designed to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information.
- The communication protocol is highly secure and employs layers of encoding and encryption.

**Evaluation:**
- The report indicates that Seaduke is capable of both C&C and data exfiltration over the same secure channel.
- The use of multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation suggests that the Duke group prioritizes security and stealth.
- Given the sophisticated nature of the Duke group and the capabilities of Seaduke, it is logical to assume that they would use the same secure channel for both C&C and data exfiltration to maintain operational security and reduce the risk of detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. Seaduke is designed to securely communicate with the C&C server using multiple layers of encryption and encoding.
2. The same secure channel is used for data exfiltration, as indicated by the malware's capability to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information.
3. The Duke group's sophisticated operational capabilities and emphasis on security suggest that they would use the same secure channel for both C&C and data exfiltration to minimize the risk of detection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
