### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Regin can use various infection vectors, including spoofed websites, web browser exploits, and application exploits. It was also observed to originate from Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin has a multi-staged architecture with six stages, each responsible for different tasks, ultimately leading to the main payload.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide explicit details, but the multi-staged architecture and use of kernel drivers and EVFS containers suggest long-term persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself, including encrypted data storage in non-traditional areas.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic, including credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Regin gathers information on processes, memory utilization, and scans for deleted files. It also monitors network traffic to IIS web servers and collects administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin has extensive C&C capabilities, including bidirectional communication and the use of various transport protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin is likely to set auto-forward rules on the victim's e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic after the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that Regin gathers information on processes, memory utilization, and scans for deleted files. It also monitors network traffic to IIS web servers and collects administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Network Traffic Monitoring:** The report mentions that Regin can monitor network traffic, but it does not specifically mention setting auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report focuses on Regin's capabilities in monitoring network traffic and collecting specific types of data, but it does not provide evidence of setting up auto-forward rules for e-mail accounts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery Capabilities:** Regin is capable of monitoring network traffic, but the specific mention of setting auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts is not present in the report.
   - **C&C and Exfiltration:** Regin uses various methods to exfiltrate data, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, but setting up auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts is not a typical method mentioned in the report.
   - **Lack of Evidence:** The report does not provide any evidence or indication that Regin sets up auto-forward rules on e-mail accounts to monitor network traffic.
