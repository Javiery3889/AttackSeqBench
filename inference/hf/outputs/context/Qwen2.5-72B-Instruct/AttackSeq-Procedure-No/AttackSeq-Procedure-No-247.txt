### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros to deliver the NanHaiShu malware.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macro decodes and runs, writes JScript data to a file, and executes it. It also saves a decoy XLS file and sets up a VBScript to delete the original file.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the registry to ensure it starts automatically.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation to hide its components.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware can receive and execute additional code for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if NanHaiShu communicates with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers only before gathering system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Exfiltration:** The report states that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. This implies that the communication with the C&C server happens after the system information is gathered.
   - **Dynamic DNS Providers:** The report does not mention the use of dynamic DNS providers specifically. It only mentions that the C&C servers are associated with a Chinese AS.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report indicates that the malware gathers system information and then uploads it to the C&C server. This sequence does not align with the question's suggestion that the communication with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers happens before gathering system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the malware gathers system information and then uploads it to the C&C server.
   - There is no mention of dynamic DNS providers being used exclusively before gathering system information.
   - The sequence of actions in the report does not support the scenario described in the question.
