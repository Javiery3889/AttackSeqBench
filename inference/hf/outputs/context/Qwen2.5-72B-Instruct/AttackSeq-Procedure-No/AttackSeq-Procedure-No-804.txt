- These codes are transmitted to C2 servers along with the stolen credentials.

**Initial Access:**
- FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros in legitimate documents.
- They also use fake OWA login pages to capture credentials.

**Defense Evasion:**
- FIN4 creates rules in victims' Outlook accounts to delete emails containing suspicious keywords.

**Credential Access:**
- FIN4 captures credentials using VBA macros and fake OWA login pages.
- Credentials are transmitted to C2 servers.

**Others:**
- FIN4 has been active since mid-2013 and has targeted over 100 organizations.
- They use insider information to benefit from stock price movements.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After transmitting stolen credentials to their C2 servers during the credential access phase, is it likely that FIN4 uses a proxy server between victims and the C2 server during their command and control phase instead of relying on Tor for anonymous communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- FIN4 uses C2 servers to receive stolen credentials.
- They create rules in victims' Outlook accounts to avoid detection.
- They have been active for a long time and target specific industries.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - Using a proxy server can help in maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection by security systems. It can also provide a layer of anonymity without the complexity and potential performance issues of Tor.
- **B: No** - Relying on Tor for anonymous communication can be more complex and may not be necessary for FIN4's operations, given their focus on specific targets and the need for sustained access.

**Reasoning:**
- FIN4's operations are sophisticated and focused on maintaining long-term access to sensitive information.
- They use multiple methods to avoid detection, such as creating rules in Outlook to delete suspicious emails.
- Using a proxy server is a common and effective method for maintaining command and control while avoiding detection.
- Tor, while providing strong anonymity, can be more complex and may not be necessary for their specific needs.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**

Using a proxy server is more likely for FIN4's operations, as it provides a balance between maintaining anonymity and avoiding the complexity and potential performance issues of Tor.
