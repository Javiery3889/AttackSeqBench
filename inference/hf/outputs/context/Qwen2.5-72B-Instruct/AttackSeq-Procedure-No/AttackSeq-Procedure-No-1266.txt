### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** PsExec was used to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group, and the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView to search for computer objects in the Active Directory database.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will leverage high-privileged accounts synced to Office 365 to perform lateral movement into a cloud environment before communicating with a C&C domain via the injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group to profile the computer and the Get-NetComputer command to search for computer objects in the Active Directory database. This indicates that the attackers were gathering information about the network and user accounts.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of high-privileged accounts synced to Office 365 for lateral movement into a cloud environment. However, it does mention the use of wmic.exe and PsExec for lateral movement within the network.
   - **Command and Control:** The report clearly states that the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides detailed information about the attackers' activities within the local network, including the use of commands to gather information and the use of tools like wmic.exe and PsExec for lateral movement.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of high-privileged accounts synced to Office 365, it is possible that the attackers could have used such accounts if they were available and accessible. However, the report does not provide any evidence to support this specific scenario.
   - The communication with the C&C domain via the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload is a confirmed step in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided in the CTI report, it is not explicitly stated that the attackers leveraged high-privileged accounts synced to Office 365 for lateral movement into a cloud environment. The report focuses on the local network activities and the use of tools like wmic.exe and PsExec for lateral movement.

**Final Answer: B: No**
