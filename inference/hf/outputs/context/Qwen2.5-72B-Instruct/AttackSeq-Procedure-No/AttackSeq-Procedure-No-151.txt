### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory. They removed disk-resident tools after use.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and removed disk-resident tools.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory to perform reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance and gathered output files during the Discovery phase using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly to infected machines' memory.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and that these tools were loaded directly into memory without writing the binary on the disk.
   - The report also mentions that the threat actor retrieved the output files and deleted them after execution.
   - This aligns perfectly with the question's scenario of performing reconnaissance and gathering output files using SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:** The report clearly indicates that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Memory-Resident Execution:** The report specifies that these tools were loaded directly into memory without writing to the disk.
   - **Output File Handling:** The report mentions that the threat actor retrieved and deleted the output files after execution.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The question mentions that TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader. This is consistent with the report's description of the threat actor's actions.
