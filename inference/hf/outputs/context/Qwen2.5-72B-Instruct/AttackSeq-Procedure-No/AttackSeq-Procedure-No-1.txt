### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The threat actor group, SectorB06, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882) using a Mongolian language decoy document.
     - The document was designed to drop first-stage malware if the exploit was successful.
   - **Execution:**
     - The first-stage malware, RasTls.dll, resolves encoded API addresses, checks for debuggers, and runs commands to manipulate file ownership and drop batch files.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware achieves persistence by decompressing and dropping two files: RasTls.dll (renamed from cclerr.wll) and IntelGraphicsController.exe/AcroRd32.exe (a legitimate signed Symantec file, real name: dot1xtra.exe).
     - These files are stored in directories related to Intel Processor Graphics and are added to the registry run keys for persistence.
     - The registry key used is 'IntelGraphicsController' with a specific value format.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware employs several defense evasion techniques, including checking for debuggers, process name hashing, and process injection.
     - It uses timestomping to modify the timestamps of its dropped files to approximate those of kernel32.dll.
     - The malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable file to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The second-stage malware is designed to create a remote command shell and communicates with external C2 IP addresses on port 443.
     - It also references internal IP addresses, indicating that the threat actor already has basic access to the victim's internal network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will achieve persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys and impersonating a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report clearly states that the malware achieves persistence by decompressing and dropping two files: RasTls.dll (renamed from cclerr.wll) and IntelGraphicsController.exe/AcroRd32.exe.
     - These files are stored in directories related to Intel Processor Graphics and are added to the registry run keys for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report also mentions that the malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable file to avoid detection.
     - This is a clear defense evasion technique.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the malware achieves persistence by adding Intel-related files to registry run keys.
   - The report also confirms that the malware impersonates a legitimate Symantec executable for defense evasion.
   - Both of these techniques are mentioned in the question and are consistent with the information provided in the report.
