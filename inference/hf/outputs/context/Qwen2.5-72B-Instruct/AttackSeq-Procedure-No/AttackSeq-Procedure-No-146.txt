### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and removed disk-resident tools.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would use RDP traffic tunneled through deployed web shells to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement before establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, which aligns with the question.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of RDP traffic tunneled through web shells for lateral movement. However, it does mention the use of web shells for persistence and the deployment of NodeIISWeb, which suggests the threat actor had the capability to use web shells for various purposes.
   - **Command and Control:** The report clearly states that TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state that TG1021 used RDP traffic tunneled through web shells for lateral movement, it is plausible given the threat actor's use of web shells and their sophisticated techniques.
   - The sequence of events in the report suggests that TG1021 was highly capable and methodical in their approach, which includes using various tools and techniques to achieve their goals.
   - The use of web shells for persistence and the deployment of NodeIISWeb for backdoor functionality indicate that the threat actor had the means to use web shells for lateral movement if needed.
