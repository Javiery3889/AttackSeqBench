### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
     - Archive files with legitimate executables and malicious DLLs for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Through 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Injection into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Limited daily windows for C&C server operation.
     - Fileless loading techniques.
     - Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system and network information.
   - **Collection:**
     - Capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Naikon APT group is likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands only before the Discovery tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system and network information, which includes host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, public IP, installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.
   - **Collection Tactic:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to create/delete files, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
   - **Communication:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor contacts C&C servers, which implies the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for communication.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report indicates that the Aria-body backdoor performs the Discovery and Collection tactics after establishing persistence and executing the loader.
     - The communication with C&C servers (using HTTP and TCP) is part of the Execution and Persistence tactics, which occur before and during the Discovery and Collection tactics.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor contacts C&C servers during the Execution and Persistence tactics.
   - The Discovery and Collection tactics are performed after the backdoor has established communication with the C&C servers.
   - Therefore, the use of HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands is not limited to before the Discovery tactic but continues throughout the attack sequence.
