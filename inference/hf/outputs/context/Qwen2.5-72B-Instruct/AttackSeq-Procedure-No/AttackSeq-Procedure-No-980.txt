### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Buckeye uses spear-phishing emails with malicious .zip attachments containing a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file.
- This leads to the download and execution of Backdoor.Pirpi on the victim's computer.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Buckeye modifies open source hacking tools to evade detection.
- They use Backdoor.Pirpi, a remote access Trojan, to maintain a presence on the network and collect information about the target's local network, including domain controllers and workstations.

**Collection:**
- Buckeye focuses on file and print servers, indicating an interest in stealing documents.
- They use zero-day exploits, customized tools, and target specific organizations, suggesting they are a state-sponsored cyberespionage group.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been tracking Buckeye's activities since 2009.
- The group has used zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash in the past.
- Symantec and Blue Coat Systems have enhanced protection capabilities against Buckeye's campaigns.
- Indicators of compromise have been published, including domain/URLs and host-based IoCs with SHA256 hashes.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Buckeye is likely to use a DCSync command with Mimikatz to retrieve credentials from an exploited controller before focusing on file and print servers to steal documents.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Buckeye uses Backdoor.Pirpi to maintain a presence and collect information about the network, including domain controllers and workstations.
- They focus on file and print servers to steal documents.
- They use zero-day exploits and customized tools, indicating a sophisticated and targeted approach.

**Relevance of DCSync and Mimikatz:**
- DCSync is a technique used to synchronize with a domain controller to retrieve password hashes and Kerberos tickets.
- Mimikatz is a tool used to extract credentials from memory, including those of domain administrators.

**Logical Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious .zip attachments lead to the execution of Backdoor.Pirpi.
2. **Defense Evasion:** Backdoor.Pirpi is used to maintain a presence and collect information about the network.
3. **Credential Access:** Given their sophisticated nature and focus on domain controllers, it is plausible that Buckeye would use DCSync with Mimikatz to retrieve credentials from an exploited controller.
4. **Collection:** With the retrieved credentials, Buckeye would then focus on file and print servers to steal documents.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that Buckeye is a sophisticated and state-sponsored group.
- They use Backdoor.Pirpi to maintain a presence and collect information about the network, including domain controllers.
- Their focus on file and print servers suggests a need for high-level access to sensitive documents.
- Using DCSync with Mimikatz to retrieve credentials from an exploited controller aligns with their sophisticated and targeted approach.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
