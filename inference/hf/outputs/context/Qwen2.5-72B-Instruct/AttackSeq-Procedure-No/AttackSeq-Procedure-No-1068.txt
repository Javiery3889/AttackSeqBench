### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Yellow Garuda is an Iran-based threat actor known for credential harvesting and using Android malware.
   - **Initial Access:** They use macro-enabled template files for initial access, hosted on third-party services like Dropbox or AWS, and phishing to coerce victims into opening the documents.
   - **Persistence:** The macro-enabled template files replace the victim's default Microsoft Word template to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use RC4-encrypted strings and remote decryption keys to disrupt analysis.
   - **Credential Access:** They have a history of extensive credential harvesting via dedicated phishing sites and a Telegram 'grabber' tool.
   - **Collection:** The Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts, storing the data in SQLite and JSON formats and allowing the deletion of messages.
   - **Others:** OPSEC mistakes have led to the disclosure of their tools and techniques.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool (messages, media, group memberships, and contact data) are divided into fixed-size chunks and exfiltrated to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the Telegram 'grabber' tool collects and stores data in SQLite and JSON formats. However, it does not explicitly state that the data is divided into fixed-size chunks for exfiltration.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does mention that Yellow Garuda uses techniques to disrupt analysis, such as RC4-encrypted strings and remote decryption keys. This suggests they are aware of the need to evade detection, but it does not specifically mention data chunking.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report provides detailed information about the data collection process but does not provide specific details about the exfiltration method beyond the storage formats.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While Yellow Garuda is known for using sophisticated techniques to evade detection, the report does not provide explicit evidence that they divide the collected data into fixed-size chunks for exfiltration.
   - The focus of the report is on the collection and storage methods, not the exfiltration method in terms of data chunking.
   - Given the lack of specific information about data chunking in the report, it is less likely that this is a standard practice for Yellow Garuda in this context.
