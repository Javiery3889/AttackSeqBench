### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits. The attackers use a PDF file with a malicious Flash object or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware targets a wide range of software to steal credentials, including various messaging and email clients, web browsers, and Windows credentials.
   - **Discovery:** CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for data exfiltration and updates.
   - **Exfiltration:** Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to capture credentials entered on a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page as part of its collection efforts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that CosmicDuke targets a variety of software to steal credentials, including Skype, Google Talk, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Thunderbird, Bat email client, Outlook Express, Outlook, and Google Desktop. It also steals Windows credentials such as LM and NT hashes, cached domain passwords, LSA secrets, and plain text keys for WLANs.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including non-English filenames.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrates collected data via FTP.

   The report does not explicitly mention Ivanti Connect Secure or any specific manipulation of login pages. However, given that CosmicDuke is known to target a wide range of software and credentials, it is plausible that it could capture credentials from a manipulated Ivanti Connect Secure login page if it is part of the software or services it targets.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - While the report does not specifically mention Ivanti Connect Secure, the broad scope of CosmicDuke's credential theft activities suggests that it could capture credentials from a manipulated login page if it is part of its target set.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
