### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The actor uses an email attachment as the initial infection vector.
     - Social engineering is used to prompt the target to open a .src file.
     - A decoy document is displayed to the user.
     - The malware is executed on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - In 2014: Malware dropped a decoy document and a fake svchost.exe binary in "C:\Windows".
     - In 2016: Malware was dropped in the local settings of the current user, and a shortcut was created to launch winnit.exe in the startup folder.
     - In 2017: Persistence was achieved by a Windows shortcut named adobe distillist.lnk.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Malware evolved from a single file to a dual file structure.
     - Decoy documents became more advanced.
     - Malware checks for previous version files.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Malware steals keystrokes and credentials from browsers.
   - **Collection:**
     - Malware steals files, keystrokes, and performs screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP.
     - C2 infrastructure hosted by 000webhost.
     - Malware connects to specific URIs for registration, uploading, and downloading files.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Malware uploads stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the operator will execute arbitrary code on the infected host only after using an email attachment and social engineering to prompt the target to execute a .src file for initial access, given that persistence is achieved by creating a Windows shortcut in the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through an email attachment and social engineering to prompt the target to open a .src file.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report mentions that in 2016, persistence was achieved by creating a shortcut to launch winnit.exe in the startup folder.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The initial access (email attachment and social engineering) must occur first to execute the malware.
     - Once the malware is executed, it can then establish persistence by creating a Windows shortcut in the startup folder.
     - The question implies that the operator will execute arbitrary code only after the initial access and persistence are established.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report.
   - The initial access is necessary to execute the malware, and once the malware is executed, it can establish persistence.
   - The operator can then execute arbitrary code on the infected host after these steps.
