### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools are used for command execution, file transfer, and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT are used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are used for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities are used for stealth and detection evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass are used to obtain credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware are used for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR are used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from network shared drives and staged locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use DNS Calculation techniques (e.g., multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to determine a command and control port) before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Techniques:** The CTI report clearly states that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools. This aligns with the exfiltration methods mentioned in the question.
   - **DNS Calculation Techniques:** The CTI report does not mention any use of DNS Calculation techniques or similar methods for determining command and control ports. The report focuses on the use of web shells, JSP tools, and other straightforward exfiltration methods.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report emphasizes the use of passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for stealth and evasion, but does not indicate the use of complex DNS-based techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Exfiltration Methods:** The report explicitly states that FIN13 uses web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration, which aligns with the question.
   - **DNS Calculation Techniques:** The report does not mention any DNS Calculation techniques or similar methods. The focus is on using web shells and other straightforward methods for exfiltration.
   - **Operational Tactics:** FIN13's tactics are described as using passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for stealth and evasion, but not complex DNS-based techniques.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI report and the analysis, FIN13 is not likely to use DNS Calculation techniques before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

**Final Answer: B: No**
