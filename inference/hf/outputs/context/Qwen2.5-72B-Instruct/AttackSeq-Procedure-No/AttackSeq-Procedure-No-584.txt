### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The FIN8 group uses BADHATCH, a backdoor, to gain initial access. BADHATCH downloads and executes a script from a domain using a malicious PowerShell command.
   - **Execution:** BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode, executing various commands.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event subscription is used to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation is achieved, likely involving the SYSTEM token and impersonating tokens of processes like lsass.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques are used, including TLS encryption and masquerading communication.
   - **Credential Access:** Credential dumping is performed using a script related to Mimikatz.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement to the Domain Controller is achieved using wmic.exe.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will enumerate AWS storage services (S3 buckets and Elastic Block Store volumes) before performing domain trust discovery with tools like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting:** The report mentions the use of commands like `systeminfo.exe`, `ipconfig.exe`, `net.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `netstat.exe` for system fingerprinting. These commands are typical for gathering basic information about the system and network.
   - **AWS Storage Services:** The report does not mention any specific targeting of AWS services or cloud infrastructure. The focus is on traditional network and system exploitation techniques.
   - **Domain Trust Discovery:** The report suggests that the attackers perform lateral movement to the Domain Controller, which is a critical step in gaining deeper access to the network. Tools like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` are commonly used for domain trust discovery and network enumeration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the focus on traditional network and system exploitation techniques, it is more likely that the attackers would perform domain trust discovery and network enumeration before targeting specific cloud services like AWS.
   - The report does not provide any evidence that the attackers are specifically interested in AWS storage services. The primary targets appear to be on-premises systems and networks.
