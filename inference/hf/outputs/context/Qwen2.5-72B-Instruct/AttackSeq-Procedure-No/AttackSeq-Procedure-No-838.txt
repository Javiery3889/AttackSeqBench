### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT28 uses spear-phishing campaigns with malicious URLs and exploit documents.
- They register domains spoofing legitimate organizations and webmail services.
- They exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2016-7855 and CVE-2016-7255 to install malware.

**Defense Evasion:**
- APT28 uses zero-day vulnerabilities, public code depositories, and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
- They obtain credentials through fabricated authorization requests.

**Credential Access:**
- APT28 uses spear-phishing to harvest credentials.
- They direct victims to fake login pages or authorize malicious applications.
- They use credential harvesters like OLDBAIT.

**Lateral Movement:**
- APT28 uses strategic web compromises (SWC) to infect users.
- They exploit known vulnerabilities on internet-facing servers.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will:
1. Install and execute a VBA script (e.g., vba_macro.exe) to drop malware (e.g., FONTCACHE.DAT).
2. Leverage tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE during their operations.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report confirms that APT28 uses spear-phishing with exploit documents to gain initial access.
- This aligns with the first part of the question, where APT28 delivers exploit documents.

**Malware Delivery:**
- The report mentions that APT28 exploits vulnerabilities to install malware.
- While the report does not explicitly mention VBA scripts or specific malware like FONTCACHE.DAT, it is common for APT groups to use VBA scripts to drop malware. This is a plausible step in their attack sequence.

**Tool Usage:**
- The report does not explicitly mention tools like CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE.
- However, APT28 is known to use a variety of tools and techniques for their operations, and the use of specific tools like these is not uncommon for advanced threat actors.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear-phishing with exploit documents, which aligns with the first part of the question.
- **Malware Delivery:** While the report does not explicitly mention VBA scripts or FONTCACHE.DAT, it is a plausible step given the nature of APT28's operations.
- **Tool Usage:** The report does not explicitly mention CHOPSTICK, EVILTOSS, and SOURFACE, but the use of such tools is consistent with APT28's known capabilities.

Given the alignment of the initial access and malware delivery steps with the report, and the plausibility of using specific tools, the most likely answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
