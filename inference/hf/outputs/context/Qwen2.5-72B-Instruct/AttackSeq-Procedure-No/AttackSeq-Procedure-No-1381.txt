### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employs passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery only after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses techniques like LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials.
   - **System Service Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention system service discovery as a step in the attack sequence. However, it is a logical step for an attacker to gather information on services after gaining access to a system, especially to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Initial Access:** Deploy web shells and custom malware.
     2. **Execution:** Use JSPRAT and other tools for command execution.
     3. **Persistence:** Deploy trojanized KeePass and other malware.
     4. **Privilege Escalation:** Use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil to escalate privileges.
     5. **Credential Access:** Dump LSASS memory and use trojanized KeePass to obtain credentials.
     6. **Lateral Movement:** Use WMI and custom web shells to move laterally.
     7. **System Service Discovery:** Gather information on services to understand the environment.
     8. **Collection:** Collect data from network shared drives.
     9. **Command and Control:** Use proxies and other protocols for communication.
     10. **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate data over web services.

   - **Logical Flow:**
     - After gaining initial access and establishing persistence, FIN13 would likely escalate privileges and obtain credentials to move laterally.
     - Once they have moved laterally, it is logical for them to gather information on services to understand the environment and identify valuable targets.
     - System service discovery is a common step in the attack lifecycle, often performed after gaining access and credentials.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the logical sequence of actions and the typical behavior of advanced threat actors, it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery after obtaining credentials via techniques like process memory dumping of LSASS and trojanized KeePass binaries.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
