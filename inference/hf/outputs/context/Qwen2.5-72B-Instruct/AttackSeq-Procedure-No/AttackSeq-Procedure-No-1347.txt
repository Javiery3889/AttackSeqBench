### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps on Google Play. The apps Camero and FileCrypt Manager acted as droppers, downloading additional DEX files from a C&C server to install the callCam app.
   - **Execution:** The callCam app hides its icon and executes in the background to collect sensitive information.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** SideWinder used device rooting and accessibility permissions for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper apps used overlay screens to hide the installation and launch of the payload app. They also employed obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
   - **Collection:** The callCam app collected various types of data from the compromised devices.
   - **Command and Control:** The C&C server was used to communicate with the compromised devices and download exploits and additional payload.
   - **Exfiltration:** The callCam app encrypted the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, verified data integrity with SHA256, and customized the encoding routine before exfiltrating it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the callCam app will encrypt data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C server **before** collecting files and screenshots from compromised devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence in the CTI Report:**
     1. **Initial Access:** Compromise devices via malicious apps.
     2. **Execution:** Install and execute the callCam app.
     3. **Privilege Escalation:** Gain higher privileges.
     4. **Defense Evasion:** Use overlay screens to hide installation and launch.
     5. **Collection:** Collect sensitive information.
     6. **Command and Control:** Communicate with the C&C server.
     7. **Exfiltration:** Encrypt and exfiltrate collected data.
   - **Sequence in the Question:**
     - The question suggests a sequence where the callCam app encrypts data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration **before** collecting files and screenshots.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - According to the CTI report, the callCam app collects data first and then encrypts and exfiltrates it. The sequence in the report is:
     1. **Collection:** Collect sensitive information.
     2. **Exfiltration:** Encrypt and exfiltrate the collected data.
   - The question suggests a different sequence where encryption and exfiltration occur before collection, which does not align with the sequence described in the CTI report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
