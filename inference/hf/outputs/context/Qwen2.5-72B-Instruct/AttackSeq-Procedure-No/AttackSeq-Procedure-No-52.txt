### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Execution:** The malware ThreatNeedle was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware was used to achieve persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques were used to evade detection, including deleting log files and using custom web shells.
   - **Credential Access:** The group used a credential harvesting tool named Responder to acquire login credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The group conducted extensive discovery activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Command and Control:** The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers and a compromised router.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group is likely to collect data from removable media devices before exfiltrating it through a custom tunneling tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the group used Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.
   - **Removable Media:** The report does not mention any activities related to collecting data from removable media devices.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the use of Windows commands and WMIC for lateral movement and the use of a custom tunneling tool for exfiltration.
   - There is no mention of the group collecting data from removable media devices in the report.
   - Given the focus on network-based activities and the use of custom tools for exfiltration, it is unlikely that the group would collect data from removable media devices as part of this specific attack sequence.
