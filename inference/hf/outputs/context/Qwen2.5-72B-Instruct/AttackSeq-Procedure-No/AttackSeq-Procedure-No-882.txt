### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop a loader.
     - Archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Injection into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Limited daily C&C server activity.
     - Fileless loading techniques.
     - Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Gathers detailed system information, hostname, public IP, and other data.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses HTTP and TCP protocols for communication.
     - Sends collected data to C&C domain with an XORed password.
     - Listens for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Aria-body backdoor is likely to set up Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning for capturing victim credentials or planting espionage-oriented malware as part of the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, including hostname and public IP.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor collects data on installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.
     - It also includes modules for USB data gathering, keylogging, reverse socks proxy, and loading extensions.
   - **Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning:**
     - This technique involves setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point to capture victim credentials or plant malware.
     - The report does not mention any specific use of Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning by the Naikon APT group.
     - The group's primary methods for data collection and persistence are through the Aria-body backdoor and its modules, which do not include setting up fake Wi-Fi access points.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to gather detailed system information and other data, which aligns with the Discovery and Collection phases.
   - The backdoor uses various modules for data collection, such as keylogging and USB data gathering, but there is no mention of Evil Twin Wi-Fi Poisoning.
   - The group's tactics focus on maintaining persistence, evading detection, and using C&C servers for command and control, rather than setting up fake Wi-Fi access points.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
