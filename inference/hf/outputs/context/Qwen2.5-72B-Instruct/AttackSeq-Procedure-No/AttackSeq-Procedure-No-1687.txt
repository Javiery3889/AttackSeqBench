### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- An email with a PDF attachment (actually an executable) was sent to Susan, a secretary at Black Gold.
- The PDF passed through security filters and initiated the attack when opened.

**Execution:**
- The executable created a folder and extracted files.
- 'stat.vbs' executed 'deca.bat', which ran 'dcp.exe' to decrypt and extract files.
- 'sai.vbs' was then executed.

**Persistence:**
- Modified the Windows registry to ensure 'aagi.bat' ran at system start.
- Used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection.
- Configured an application to run another batch file every hour to maintain operations.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.
- Remained undetected for almost six months.

**Collection:**
- Collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials.

**Command and Control:**
- Used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server.
- 'iei.bat' was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of data.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013.

**Others:**
- The attack, dubbed 'Phantom Menace', targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.
- Linked to a scam involving fake oil deals.
- Attackers based in Nigeria, with connections to Ikeja.
- Victims were unwilling to report the crime.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After uploading credentials to an external FTP server they controlled, is it likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores only after persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Persistence:** The attack configured applications to run batch files every hour to maintain operations.
- **Collection:** The attack used legitimate applications to collect credentials recurrently every hour.
- **Command and Control:** The attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server.
- **Exfiltration:** Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server.

**Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
- **Persistence:** Configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity.
- **Collection:** Using legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores.
- **Exfiltration:** Uploading credentials to an external FTP server.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the attackers configured applications to run batch files every hour to maintain operations (Persistence).
- The report also mentions that the attack used legitimate applications to collect credentials recurrently every hour (Collection).
- The report indicates that the stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server (Exfiltration).

The sequence described in the question aligns with the sequence described in the CTI report. The attackers first ensured persistence by configuring applications to run batch files every hour, then used legitimate applications to collect credentials, and finally exfiltrated the credentials to an external FTP server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The attackers configured applications to run batch files every hour to maintain operations (Persistence).
2. The attackers used legitimate applications to collect credentials recurrently every hour (Collection).
3. The attackers exfiltrated the stolen credentials to an external FTP server (Exfiltration).

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
