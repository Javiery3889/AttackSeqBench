### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Turla used a watering hole attack on Armenian websites.
     - Malicious JavaScript was inserted into compromised websites.
     - The JavaScript loaded external scripts that fingerprinted the visitor's browser and delivered a second-stage malicious JavaScript.
     - A fake Adobe Flash update lure was used to trick users into downloading and installing malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - The fake installer installed both Turla malware and a legitimate Adobe Flash program.
   - **Persistence:**
     - NetFlash and PyFlash malware variants used Windows scheduled tasks to establish persistence.
     - NetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and sets up a scheduled task.
     - PyFlash persists by modifying the Windows task that regularly launches the malware.
   - **Discovery:**
     - PyFlash backdoor executes various OS-related commands to gather information about the machine.
     - Commands include `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, `ipconfig`, `getmac`, and `arp`.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The output of PyFlash surveillance and C&C commands is exfiltrated using the C&C protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if PyFlash will gather system information such as `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, and `arp` through the PyFlash backdoor as part of the discovery phase.
   - The question also mentions communication with a hardcoded C&C server and the use of AES-128 in CBC mode on ports like 8,000 for command and control operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication with C&C Server:**
     - The report mentions that PyFlash exfiltrates data to the C&C server, which implies communication with the C&C server.
   - **Use of Encryption:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of AES-128 in CBC mode, but it is common for sophisticated malware to use encryption for C&C communications.
   - **Gathering System Information:**
     - The report clearly states that PyFlash executes commands such as `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, `ipconfig`, `getmac`, and `arp` to gather information about the machine.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The execution of these commands is part of the discovery phase, as described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report confirms that PyFlash gathers system information using commands like `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, and `arp`.
   - The report also indicates that PyFlash exfiltrates this information to the C&C server.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of AES-128 in CBC mode, it is a reasonable assumption given the sophistication of the Turla group and the need for secure communication.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question aligns with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.
