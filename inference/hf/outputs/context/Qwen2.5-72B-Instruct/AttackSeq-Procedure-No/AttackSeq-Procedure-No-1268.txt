### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish, a malicious JavaScript-based framework, to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - **Execution:** The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, encrypting computers and servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, the attackers will subsequently enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, for discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not mention any specific activities related to AWS infrastructure or cloud services. The report focuses on the attackers' activities within the victim's internal network, including the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and the deployment of WastedLocker ransomware.
   - The report describes the attackers' focus on compromising and moving laterally within the victim's internal network, rather than targeting cloud infrastructure.
   - The use of tools like Cobalt Strike and PsExec suggests a focus on internal network exploitation and control, rather than cloud-specific activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was gained through a malicious JavaScript framework (SocGholish) delivered via compromised websites.
   - The attackers then used Cobalt Strike and other tools to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, and deploy ransomware.
   - There is no mention of any activities related to AWS or cloud infrastructure in the report.
   - Given the focus on internal network exploitation and the lack of any cloud-related activities, it is unlikely that the attackers would enumerate AWS infrastructure for discovery.

### Final Answer: B: No
