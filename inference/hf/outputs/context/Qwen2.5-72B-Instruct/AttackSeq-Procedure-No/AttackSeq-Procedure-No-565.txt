### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology, indicating a high level of reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The report explicitly mentions that the attackers parked domains for future use (T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains). This indicates a proactive approach to resource development.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained a foothold in the network by being selective and careful.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access, implying the use of privilege escalation techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report details several techniques used to avoid detection, including T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497.
   - **Credential Access:** The use of valid accounts (T1078) is mentioned.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used techniques like T1057 and T1012 to gain knowledge about the systems and network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network to reach their objectives.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The report discusses techniques like T1071 and T1568 for maintaining control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the attackers parked domains for future use as part of their Resource Development efforts only after using a compromised software update as their initial access vector through T1195 Supply Chain Compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development (Parking Domains):** The report clearly states that the attackers parked domains for future use, which is a Resource Development technique (T1583.001).
   - **Initial Access (Supply Chain Compromise):** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions. However, it is logical to consider that the attackers would have developed resources (like parking domains) before or during the initial access phase to ensure they had the necessary infrastructure in place for their operations.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The question implies a specific sequence where the attackers parked domains only after gaining initial access through a compromised software update. However, the report does not provide a clear timeline that supports this specific sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the attackers had a high level of preparation and resource development, which suggests that they likely parked domains as part of their initial planning and resource acquisition.
   - The compromised software update (T1195) was a critical part of their initial access, but the report does not specify that the domain parking occurred only after this initial access.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack, it is more plausible that the attackers had already parked domains and developed other resources before or during the initial access phase to ensure a smooth and undetected operation.
