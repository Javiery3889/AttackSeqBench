### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering, often through fake accounts and identities, to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** They use various malware, including a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts.
   - **Persistence:** They repeatedly target the same victims with new cover stories and techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use fake identities, breach websites to set up phishing pages, and employ anti-debugging and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** Infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download additional malware and extract information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Rocket Kitten is likely to prompt the user for their credentials through a GUI input capture after using a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Usage:** The report mentions that Rocket Kitten uses a keylogger to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts. This indicates that they are already capturing credentials through keystrokes.
   - **GUI Input Capture:** The report does not mention any specific use of GUI input capture (e.g., fake login pages or pop-ups) to prompt users for their credentials. Instead, they rely on social engineering and keyloggers.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** The group's persistence and defense evasion techniques focus on maintaining access and avoiding detection, rather than directly prompting users for credentials through a GUI.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** Rocket Kitten gains initial access through spear phishing and uses a keylogger to capture keystrokes.
   - **Credential Access:** The keylogger logs keystrokes, which includes capturing credentials as users type them.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** They use various techniques to maintain access and avoid detection, but there is no mention of using GUI input capture to prompt users for credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** The C&C server is used to manage the infected machines and extract information, but again, no mention of GUI input capture.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report, it is unlikely that Rocket Kitten will prompt the user for their credentials through a GUI input capture after using a keylogger to capture keystrokes. The group primarily relies on keyloggers and social engineering to gain and maintain access.

**Final Answer: B: No**
