### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, and using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will capture passwords by prompting victims with a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window as part of data collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that Gamaredon inserts malicious macros into existing documents for persistence and uses backdoors to list interesting files (Office documents) during discovery.
   - **Data Collection and Exfiltration:**
     - The report states that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **Operating System:**
     - The question specifically mentions a "macOS needs to access System Settings" GUI window, which is not mentioned in the report. The report primarily focuses on Windows-based attacks and does not indicate any specific targeting of macOS.
   - **Password Capture:**
     - The report does not mention any techniques for capturing passwords or using GUI prompts to trick users into providing credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any evidence that Gamaredon targets macOS or uses GUI prompts to capture passwords. The group's primary methods involve Windows-based attacks, including spearphishing, scripting, and backdoors.
   - The focus of the group's activities is on spreading malware, maintaining persistence, and exfiltrating documents, rather than on sophisticated password capture techniques.
