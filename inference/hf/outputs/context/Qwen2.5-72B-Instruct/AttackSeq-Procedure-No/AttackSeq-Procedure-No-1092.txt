### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043, T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SWEED's malware, `educrety.exe`, will sniff network traffic to collect credentials before dropping a PE file.
   - Key points to consider:
     - **Software Packing and File Deletion:** The malware used software packing (T1045) and deleted the original file (T1107) for defense evasion.
     - **Dropping a PE File:** The report mentions a dropped PE file with a specific hash.
     - **Network Sniffing:** The report does not explicitly mention network sniffing (T1040 - Network Sniffing).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Software Packing and File Deletion:** These techniques are clearly mentioned in the report and are part of the defense evasion tactics.
   - **Dropping a PE File:** The report confirms that a PE file was dropped.
   - **Network Sniffing:** The report does not mention network sniffing. Instead, it states that the malware collected data from the local system (T1005) and sent stolen credentials to a C2 server (T1043, T1071).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the use of software packing, file deletion, and data collection from the local system.
   - The report does not mention network sniffing, which is a different technique (T1040) that involves monitoring network traffic to capture credentials.
   - Given the focus on local data collection and the absence of network sniffing in the report, it is less likely that the malware would sniff network traffic to collect credentials before dropping a PE file.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
