### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - SideCopy targets government personnel in India.
     - Uses decoys and honeytraps to lure victims.
     - Themes designed to target military personnel.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains.
     - Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses decoy documents, images, and cloned websites.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Uses themes to target military personnel.
   - **Collection:**
     - Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Targets Kavach authentication databases and uses njRAT malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SideCopy is likely to gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services servers to establish initial access to victim systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report mentions that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers for initial access.
     - There is no mention of gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.
   - **Resource Development and Execution:**
     - The focus is on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
     - The report does not indicate any activities related to Azure AD services.
   - **Defense Evasion and Discovery:**
     - The report mentions using decoy documents, images, and cloned websites to avoid detection.
     - There is no indication of targeting Azure AD services for initial access.
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:**
     - The report focuses on exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases and using njRAT malware.
     - There is no mention of gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by SideCopy.
   - The initial access methods described in the report do not include gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services.
   - The focus of SideCopy's activities is on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, and using various infection vectors like malicious LNK files and HTAs.
   - There is no evidence in the report suggesting that SideCopy targets Azure AD services for initial access.

### Final Answer: B: No
