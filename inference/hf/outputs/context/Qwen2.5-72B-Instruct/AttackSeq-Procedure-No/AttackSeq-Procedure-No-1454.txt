### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **T1566** (Phishing)
- **T1566.001** (Spearphishing Attachment)
- The adversary sent emails with a PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.

**Execution:**
- **T1204** (User Execution)
- **T1204.002** (Malicious File)
- The adversary relies on tricking users into executing malware.
- The adversary used malicious DLLs via DLL Hijacking to execute malware.

**Persistence:**
- **T1547.001** (Registry Run Keys)
- **T1574.001** (DLL Search Order Hijacking)
- **T1574.002** (DLL Side-Loading)
- The adversary used the Run registry key to maintain persistence.
- The adversary used malicious DLLs loaded via DLL Hijacking into a process created from a legitimate binary to execute malware.
- The adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads malicious DLLs.

**Defense Evasion:**
- **T1027.006** (HTML Smuggling)
- **T1140** (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information)
- **T1553.005** (Mark-of-the-Web Bypass)
- **T1574.001** (DLL Search Order Hijacking)
- **T1574.002** (DLL Side-Loading)
- ENVYSCOUT delivery script uses HTML Smuggling to bypass security controls.
- The adversary uses obfuscation to protect sensitive information.
- The adversary abuses container files such as ISO to deliver malicious payloads that are not tagged with MOTW.
- The adversary used malicious DLLs loaded via DLL Hijacking into a process created from a legitimate binary to execute malware.
- The adversary maintains persistence by planting a copy of a legitimate binary that loads malicious DLLs.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After sending emails with diplomatic themes containing a PDF link to ENVYSCOUT during the Initial Access phase, is it likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The adversary uses phishing emails with diplomatic themes to deliver a PDF containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.
- The adversary uses various techniques for execution, persistence, and defense evasion, including DLL Hijacking and HTML Smuggling.
- The report does not mention the use of custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor.

**Resource Development Phase:**
- The Resource Development phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves the adversary gathering information and resources to support their operations.
- The report does not provide any information about the Resource Development phase or the use of custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report focuses on the Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Defense Evasion phases.
- There is no mention of the Resource Development phase or the use of specific custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor.
- Given the information provided, it is not likely that the adversary will use custom malware, including Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor, during the Resource Development phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention the Resource Development phase or the use of custom malware like Mongall and Heyoka Backdoor.
- The focus of the report is on the Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, and Defense Evasion phases.
- Without additional information about the Resource Development phase, it is not reasonable to assume the use of specific custom malware.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
