### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
- A zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Discovery:**
- Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.

**Collection:**
- The malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
- It is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers.
- The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting services.
- The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.

**Exfiltration:**
- Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn's tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group.
- Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, as well as targets in various sectors.
- The group uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses.
- Longhorn operates with a high degree of operational security and appears to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, with indicators suggesting it is from an English-speaking, North American country.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware, is it likely that Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report confirms that Longhorn uses a zero-day exploit embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Discovery and Collection:**
- The report states that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
- The malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.

**Command and Control and Exfiltration:**
- The report details the C&C and exfiltration methods used by Longhorn, but it does not mention the abuse of OAuth access tokens.

**Critical Context:**
- The report does not provide any specific information about Longhorn abusing OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.

**Evaluation:**
- While Longhorn's malware is designed for detailed system fingerprinting and discovery, the report does not indicate that they specifically abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
- The focus of the report is on the initial infection, system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities of the malware.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of Longhorn's attack, focusing on initial access, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
- The report does not mention the abuse of OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
- Given the information provided, it is not likely that Longhorn's tools will abuse OAuth access tokens before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
