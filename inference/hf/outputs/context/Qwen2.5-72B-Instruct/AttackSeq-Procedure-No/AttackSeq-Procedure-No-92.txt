### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Executes via a service (T1569.002)
- Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)

**Persistence:**
- Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)

**Defense Evasion:**
- Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
- Can timestomp files (T1070.006)
- Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
- Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
- Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)

**Discovery:**
- Obtains file and directory listings (T1083)
- Lists running processes (T1057)
- Obtains system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, and architecture (T1082)
- Obtains the local IP address (T1016)
- Obtains system time and time zone (T1124)

**Command and Control:**
- Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
- Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
- Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

**Exfiltration:**
- Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)

**Others:**
- Targeted deployment, shares code similarities with NukeSped, and has been active since December 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to steal data from the victim's clipboard before compressing collected files and sending them to the C&C server.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery:**
- The report mentions that Vyveva's backdoor can obtain the local IP address (T1016) and system time and time zone (T1124).

**Exfiltration:**
- The report states that Vyveva exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041).

**Clipboard Stealing:**
- The report does not mention any TTPs related to stealing data from the victim's clipboard.

**File Compression:**
- The report does not mention any TTPs related to compressing collected files.

**Conclusion:**
- The report does not provide any evidence that Vyveva's backdoor steals data from the victim's clipboard or compresses collected files before exfiltration. The exfiltration is mentioned, but the specific methods of data collection and preparation (such as clipboard stealing and file compression) are not detailed.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not mention clipboard stealing or file compression as part of Vyveva's TTPs.
- The report only confirms that Vyveva exfiltrates data to the C&C server.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that Vyveva's backdoor steals data from the victim's clipboard before compressing collected files and sending them to the C&C server.

**Final Answer: B: No**
