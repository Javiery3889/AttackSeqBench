### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Used Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Execution:**
     - Command and scripting interpreters, deploying containers, scheduling tasks.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creating services, scheduled tasks, and initialization scripts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Abuse of elevation control mechanisms, creating or modifying system processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Various techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data and used WinRAR and megacmd for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used various protocols and techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Compressed files and used cloud services for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing before using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention lateral movement, but it does describe techniques that can be used for lateral movement, such as exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report clearly states that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not provide a specific sequence of actions that includes lateral movement followed by discovery. However, it is common in cyber attacks for threat actors to perform lateral movement to gain access to more systems before conducting discovery to understand the network environment.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - Earth Lusca used reconnaissance techniques and initial access vectors like spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Execution and Persistence:**
     - They executed malicious code and established persistence mechanisms.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
     - They gained higher-level permissions and evaded defenses.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - They targeted user credentials to gain greater access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - While not explicitly stated, the use of remote services and internal spear phishing suggests that lateral movement was likely part of their strategy.
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:**
     - They collected and exfiltrated data.

Given the common attack pattern and the techniques described in the report, it is reasonable to infer that Earth Lusca likely engaged in lateral movement before or during the discovery phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
