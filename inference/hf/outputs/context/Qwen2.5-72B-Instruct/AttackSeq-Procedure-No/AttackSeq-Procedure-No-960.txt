### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - The attackers used system utilities like `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened malicious documents, which contained job offers.
   - **Execution:**
     - The attackers executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The attackers created services using `sc.exe` and local administrator accounts.
     - They placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The attackers escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The group used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files and hiding malware.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to the C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections before escalating privileges by creating local administrator accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions that the attackers used `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance. These tools are commonly used to discover systems over the local network (LAN).
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report states that the attackers escalated privileges by creating local administrator accounts and manipulating system processes and services.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The reconnaissance activities (using `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe`) are described before the privilege escalation activities (creating local administrator accounts).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the attackers used reconnaissance tools to discover systems on the network before they escalated privileges.
   - The sequence of events in the report supports the idea that the reconnaissance phase (discovering systems over LAN) occurred before the privilege escalation phase (creating local administrator accounts).
