### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with the Komplex Binder, which saves a second payload (the dropper) and opens a decoy PDF file.
     - The Komplex Dropper drops the final payload and ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.
     - The final payload, the Komplex Payload, downloads and executes files as directed by the C&C servers.
   - **Execution:**
     - The XAgent component's main module, BootXLoader, checks for a debugger and waits for internet connectivity before initializing communication with C&C servers.
     - The MainHandler module starts and manages C&C commands and spying modules.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Komplex Dropper ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.
     - The Launcher module within XAgent generates the malware's file path and re-executes itself.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - XAgent checks for the presence of a debugger and exits if one is found.
     - The Komplex Binder opens a decoy PDF file to distract the user.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The Password module within XAgent obtains passwords from Firefox browser profiles.
   - **Collection:**
     - The FileSystem module manages files.
     - The CameraShot module (not implemented) suggests an intention to capture images.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with C&C servers starts by selecting a server from a hardcoded list, sending a hello message, and starting two communication threads: one for receiving commands and one for sending data.
     - The HTTPChannel module is used for continuous communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The msgPacket structure is used to exfiltrate information, which is encrypted with RC4 and sent in a POST request to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the XAgent component will delay execution of its core functionality using a timer after sending a hello message to the C&C server, instead of communicating with the server via the HTTPChannel module to receive commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication Process:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that after sending a hello message, the XAgent component starts two main communication threads: one for receiving commands and one for sending data.
     - The HTTPChannel module is used for continuous communication with the C&C server.
   - **Timer Mechanism:**
     - There is no mention in the CTI report of a timer mechanism that delays the execution of core functionality after sending the hello message.
     - The report emphasizes immediate communication and continuous interaction with the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the XAgent component initializes communication with the C&C server immediately after sending the hello message.
   - The HTTPChannel module is used for continuous communication, suggesting that the malware does not delay its core functionality using a timer.
   - The focus is on immediate and continuous interaction with the C&C server to receive commands and send data.
