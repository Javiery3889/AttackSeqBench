### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Word document using the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Execution:**
     - The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt, which then invokes PowerShell.
     - PowerShell runs two commands:
       1. Downloads a string from a URL and executes it as an encoded command.
       2. Downloads a file from a URL, creates a batch file, and a registry entry for persistence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - A batch file and a registry entry are created to ensure the malware persists on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses and move away from VBA scripts.
   - **Others:**
     - The document is themed around a recent terrorist attack in New York City.
     - The document downloads the Seduploader payload, which is a first-stage reconnaissance implant.
     - The domain and IP addresses involved are provided, and the document is distributed from a specific URL.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malicious document will use the DDE technique to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands after contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The document creates a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.
   - **Control Server Interaction:**
     - The document contacts a control server to download the Seduploader payload.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands to download and install the Seduploader payload.
     - The Seduploader payload is the first-stage reconnaissance implant, which profiles the victim's system and sends information to the attackers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell and execute encoded commands to download and install the Seduploader payload.
   - The question asks if this is likely to happen after contacting a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - The sequence described in the report matches the sequence described in the question.
