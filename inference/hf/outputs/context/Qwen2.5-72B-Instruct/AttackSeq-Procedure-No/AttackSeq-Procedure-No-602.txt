### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Sednit group uses email messages with malicious attachments to target specific entities.
     - These attachments are often Microsoft Office documents or archives.
     - The documents use VBA, exploits, or DDE to download the first stage payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access is gained through email attachments containing malicious documents.
     - These documents execute VBA macros to download and run the first stage payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Delphi downloader adds a Windows registry entry under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\` to ensure persistence.
     - The AutoIt downloader uses a similar persistence mechanism.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Delphi downloader displays a splash window with a bogus error message.
     - The AutoIt downloader shows a splash screen to mislead the victim.
     - The Delphi backdoor uses AES encryption to protect its configuration data and communications.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The AutoIt downloader performs extensive reconnaissance on victim computers.
     - It uses WMI objects to collect various information.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The Delphi backdoor communicates with the C&C server by storing reports in temporary files and encrypting them before sending.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group will leverage Scheduled Tasks through a Group Policy Object (GPO) to execute malware at a predetermined time after gaining initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents using VBA macros.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the Sednit group gains initial access through email attachments containing malicious documents with VBA macros.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report mentions that the group ensures persistence through Windows registry entries.
     - There is no mention of using Scheduled Tasks or GPOs for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The group uses splash windows and AES encryption to evade detection.
     - There is no indication of using Scheduled Tasks or GPOs for defense evasion.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The group uses temporary files and AES encryption for communication with the C&C server.
     - There is no mention of using Scheduled Tasks or GPOs for command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the Sednit group's TTPs, focusing on the use of email attachments with VBA macros for initial access, Windows registry entries for persistence, and various methods for defense evasion and command and control.
   - The report does not mention the use of Scheduled Tasks or GPOs for any of these activities.
   - Given the detailed information provided, it is unlikely that the Sednit group would use Scheduled Tasks through a GPO to execute malware at a predetermined time, as this method is not part of their known TTPs.

### Final Answer: B: No
