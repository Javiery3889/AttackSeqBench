### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Persistence:**
- FIN1 uses the Nemesis bootkit to infect the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR).
- This infection allows the malware to execute before the Windows operating system boots.
- The malware remains even after an operating system reinstallation.

**Command and Control:**
- Nemesis includes backdoors with support for various network protocols and communication channels.
- Capabilities include file transfer, screen capture, keystroke logging, process injection, process manipulation, and task scheduling.
- FIN1 continually updates Nemesis, deploying different variants and adding functionality.

**Others:**
- FIN1 is a financially motivated threat group, potentially located in Russia or a Russian-speaking country.
- They target financial services organizations to steal monetizable data.
- The use of bootkits for persistence suggests sophisticated toolsets and selective deployment based on the difficulty of penetration or the value of the targeted data.
- Incident responders need tools to access and search raw disks for evidence of bootkits, as re-installing the operating system is no longer sufficient.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Nemesis bootkit achieves persistence by infecting the system's Volume Boot Record (VBR), is it likely that the malware will evade detection by placing install files into directories that are excluded from scanning?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Nemesis bootkit infects the VBR, allowing it to execute before the operating system boots.
- This makes detection and removal challenging.
- The malware remains even after an operating system reinstallation.
- The use of bootkits for persistence suggests sophisticated toolsets and selective deployment.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - Placing install files in directories excluded from scanning is a common technique to evade detection.
  - However, the report emphasizes that the malware's persistence is primarily due to its infection of the VBR, which is a more sophisticated and less common method.
  - The report does not mention placing files in excluded directories as a primary evasion technique.

- **B: No**
  - The report focuses on the VBR infection as the primary method of persistence and evasion.
  - While placing files in excluded directories is a known evasion technique, the report does not suggest that this is a significant part of the Nemesis malware's strategy.
  - The sophistication of the VBR infection suggests that the malware is designed to evade detection through more advanced means.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report emphasizes the sophistication of the Nemesis bootkit, particularly its infection of the VBR.
- The VBR infection is a highly effective method of persistence and evasion, making it less likely that the malware would rely on placing files in directories excluded from scanning.
- The report does not mention this as a significant evasion technique, suggesting that the primary method of evasion is the VBR infection itself.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
