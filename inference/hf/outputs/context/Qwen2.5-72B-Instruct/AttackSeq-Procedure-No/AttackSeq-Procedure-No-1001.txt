### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise targets. A specific example is the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - **Collection:** The malware has extensive remote control capabilities and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
   - **Command and Control:** Longhorn configures specific domain and IP address combinations for C&C servers, using privacy services to hide their identity. Communication is over HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.
   - **Others:** Symantec has been tracking Longhorn for years, and the group operates with high operational security, targeting governments and organizations in various sectors.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Longhorn is likely to follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents only before gaining initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report clearly states that Longhorn uses zero-day vulnerabilities embedded in Word documents to gain initial access. This aligns with the question.
   - **Discovery and Collection:** The report mentions detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities, which are part of the espionage operations.
   - **Command and Control and Exfiltration:** The report describes operational security measures, including the use of specific domains, IP addresses, and custom cryptographic protocols to avoid detection.
   - **Vault 7 Documents:** The question mentions following guidelines from the Vault 7 documents. However, the CTI report does not mention the Vault 7 documents or any specific guidelines from them. The report focuses on Longhorn's own operational security measures.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a clear sequence of TTPs: initial access via a zero-day vulnerability, followed by detailed system fingerprinting and discovery, and then operational security measures to avoid detection.
   - The question asks if Longhorn follows Vault 7 guidelines only before gaining initial access. The CTI report does not mention Vault 7 guidelines, and the operational security measures described are specific to Longhorn.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that Longhorn follows Vault 7 guidelines only before gaining initial access, as their operational security measures are part of their overall TTPs and not limited to a specific phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
