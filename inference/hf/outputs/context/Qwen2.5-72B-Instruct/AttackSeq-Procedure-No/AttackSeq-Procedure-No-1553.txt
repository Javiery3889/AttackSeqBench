### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The initial access vector was through spear phishing emails.
- The emails contained OLE2 format documents with embedded links.
- When opened in Microsoft Word, these documents would send a GET request to the attacker's server.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used an undocumented Word feature to avoid detection.
- The documents contained no macros, exploits, or active content, making them appear benign.
- The feature involved the INCLUDEPICTURE field with a Unicode link that Word would ignore but still follow a URL attached to a form within the document.

**Others:**
- The feature is present in Microsoft Office for iOS and Android but not in LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
- Kaspersky Lab's security products can detect this technique.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that the Freakyshelly attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents containing embedded links in spear phishing emails before using a technique in which Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents.
   - Documents contain embedded links.
   - Opening the document in Microsoft Word sends a GET request to the attacker's server.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Use of an undocumented Word feature (INCLUDEPICTURE field with Unicode link).
   - The link is ignored by Word but the URL in the form is followed.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if the attackers would gain initial access through OLE2 format documents with embedded links before using a technique where Microsoft Word sends a GET request to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is through spear phishing emails with OLE2 format documents containing embedded links.
- When these documents are opened, a GET request is sent to the attacker's server.
- The report does not explicitly mention that the GET request is used to inform the attackers about the installed software during reconnaissance. However, it is reasonable to infer that the GET request could be used for reconnaissance purposes, such as identifying the victim's environment or installed software.

**Conclusion:**
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report.
- The initial access through OLE2 format documents with embedded links is followed by a GET request to the attacker's server, which could be used for reconnaissance.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
