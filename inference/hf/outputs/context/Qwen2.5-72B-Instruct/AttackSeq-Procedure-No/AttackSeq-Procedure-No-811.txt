### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - WinDealer executes by reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - It loads a DLL module into memory.
     - It steals information from the victim's PC, including network configuration and SNS application details.
     - Stolen data is saved with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files are encoded using XOR with the key "b6a7%7486".
     - Communication with C2 servers is encrypted using AES and RSA.
     - Stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.
   - **Discovery:**
     - WinDealer discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - It processes and stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     - Encrypts an AES key with RSA and sends it to the C2 server.
     - Receives commands from the C2 server and sends results back after encryption.
     - Communicates with non-existent domains and uses icanhazip[.]com for IP address verification.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.
   - **Others:**
     - LuoYu Attack Group targets Korean and Japanese organizations.
     - WinDealer monitors and processes data from USB memory, documents, desktop, recycle bin, and SNS application folders.
     - Configuration is stored in several folders under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - Uses a hardcoded RSA1024bit public key for encryption.
     - DLL module named "MozillaDll.dll" has export functions for stealing data, setting configuration, and initiating commands.
     - Monitors items such as files stored in USB memory and folders related to SNS applications, saving related items in separate files to be sent to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer collected data from removable media and targeted relevant folders only after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration and staging encrypted stolen data in the `%TEMP%` folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - WinDealer discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - It processes and stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.
   - **Others:**
     - WinDealer monitors and processes data from USB memory, documents, desktop, recycle bin, and SNS application folders.
     - This suggests that the malware collects data from various sources, including removable media and specific folders.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that WinDealer performs discovery to gather information about the infected PC and network configuration.
   - It then processes and stages the stolen data in the `%TEMP%` directory, encrypting it before exfiltration.
   - The report also mentions that WinDealer monitors and processes data from USB memory and specific folders, which aligns with the question's scenario.
   - Therefore, it is likely that WinDealer collected data from removable media and targeted relevant folders only after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration and staging encrypted stolen data in the `%TEMP%` folder.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
