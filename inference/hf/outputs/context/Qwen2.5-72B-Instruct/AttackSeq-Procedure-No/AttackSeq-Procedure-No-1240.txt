### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 scans for new targets, particularly in Ukraine and Spain.
     - Uses a python script, a database, scan bots, and a Django application for administration and reporting.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses spear phishing emails, typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames.
     - First stage: dropper named runrun.exe.
   - **Execution:**
     - Second stage: dropper named winloat.exe.
     - Deploys tools like run.exe, xp.exe, and svehost.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Changes file timestamps to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Uses CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe).
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Scans IP ranges and reports back to a central server.
   - **Collection:**
     - Deploys pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to use DNS tunneling for C2 communication after discovering vulnerable systems and reporting results to a centralized server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - APT28 uses scanning and reporting to identify and target vulnerable systems.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report mentions the use of a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers.
     - However, it does not explicitly mention DNS tunneling.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 uses techniques like changing file timestamps and a proxy tool to evade detection.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The report does not provide specific details about DNS tunneling, but it does highlight the use of sophisticated techniques to maintain C2 communication.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While APT28 uses sophisticated techniques for C2 communication, the report does not explicitly mention DNS tunneling.
   - The use of a proxy tool (svehost.exe) suggests that APT28 has methods to bypass network restrictions, but this does not necessarily imply DNS tunneling.
   - DNS tunneling is a specific technique that is not mentioned in the report, and the report focuses more on other methods like proxy tools and file timestamp manipulation.
