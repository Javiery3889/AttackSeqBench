### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Command and Control (C2):**
  - Binaries coded to receive instructions from C2 servers.
  - These binaries are W32 Cabinet self-extracting files.
  - They drop a variant of the DDoS tool known as KernelBot.
  - KernelBot implants receive targeting instructions from C2 servers hard-coded into the sample.
  - Two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files.
  - Encoded configuration files decode to instructions for attacking various domains and IPs, primarily associated with Next Media or Apple daily websites, and a few IPs hosting the HKGolden forum.

- **Others:**
  - DDoS attacks linked to previously observed APT activity (Operation Poisoned Hurricane).
  - Overlap in tools and infrastructure used by China-based APT actors.
  - Use of digital certificates previously used by APT actors.
  - Chinese government is the entity most likely to be interested in achieving both DDoS and APT objectives.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After observing two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files issued by the DDOS C2 servers, is it likely that attackers rebooted the target system once the various wiping processes were complete instead of launching Distributed Denial of Service attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and causing Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'?

- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Attack Sequence from CTI Report:**
  1. **Initial Infection:**
     - Binaries (W32 Cabinet self-extracting files) are delivered to the target systems.
  2. **Command and Control:**
     - Binaries receive instructions from C2 servers.
  3. **DDoS Tool Deployment:**
     - KernelBot is dropped and receives targeting instructions.
  4. **Configuration Encoding:**
     - Configuration files are encoded using two different single-byte XOR keys.
  5. **DDoS Attack Execution:**
     - KernelBot network attacks various domains and IPs, primarily associated with Next Media or Apple daily websites, and a few IPs hosting the HKGolden forum.

- **Question Context:**
  - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers rebooted the target system after completing wiping processes instead of launching DDoS attacks.
  - The CTI report does not mention any wiping processes or system reboots. It focuses on the DDoS attack sequence.

- **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
  - **Choice A: Yes**
    - This choice suggests that the attackers rebooted the target system after wiping processes.
    - The CTI report does not mention any wiping processes or system reboots. It only describes the DDoS attack sequence.
  - **Choice B: No**
    - This choice suggests that the attackers did not reboot the target system after wiping processes and instead launched DDoS attacks.
    - This aligns with the CTI report, which describes the DDoS attack sequence without any mention of wiping processes or system reboots.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report clearly describes the DDoS attack sequence, including the use of C2 servers, the deployment of KernelBot, and the targeting of specific domains and IPs.
- The report does not mention any wiping processes or system reboots.
- Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers rebooted the target system after completing wiping processes. Instead, they focused on launching DDoS attacks against the specified targets.

**Final Answer: B: No**
