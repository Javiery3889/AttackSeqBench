### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email C2.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, custom droppers (LATCHKEY), and malware (DRAWSTRING).
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Web services, web shells, and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will stage archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server before targeting specific information to aid in fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses WMI and custom tools like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services, using tools like web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.
   - **OWA Server:** The report does not specifically mention the use of OWA servers for staging data. However, it does mention the use of web services and web-accessible directories for exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement and Exfiltration:** FIN13's use of WMI and custom tools for lateral movement is consistent with the report. They also use web services and web-accessible directories for exfiltration.
   - **OWA Server:** While the report does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses OWA servers for staging data, it is plausible that they could use any web-accessible server for this purpose, given their use of web shells and JSP tools.
   - **Fraudulent Transactions:** The endgame of FIN13 involves processing POS data and sending fraudulent ISO 8583 transactions, which suggests they need to collect and stage data before exfiltration.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the information in the report, it is plausible that FIN13 could use an OWA server for staging data, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. The use of web-accessible directories and web services for exfiltration supports this possibility.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
