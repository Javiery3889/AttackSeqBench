### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
     - Initial shellcode stage located and executed a secondary shellcode stub.
     - Secondary shellcode stub decrypted and executed an embedded payload.
     - Payload created a temporary file in the %TEMP% folder and executed it using WinExec.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll.
     - hccutils.dll performed security product checks and initiated the next stage of execution.
     - Used three techniques for persistence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Modified registry keys to ensure malicious DLLs run after reboot or with every user mode process.
     - Injected ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistent execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Customized installation to avoid 24 identified security products.
     - Used multi-stage installation with checks to detect analysis by security researchers.
     - Created mutexes and named events to ensure only one instance was running.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
     - Sent encrypted traffic including a beacon and collected information.
     - Supported proxy usage for victims behind web proxies.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated data including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.
     - Compressed, encrypted, and stored data in specific directories or sent to the C2 server.
     - Logged file and directory operations, clipboard data, and encrypted network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to target Skype users and automatically capture data from removable media and steal sensitive files only after evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report clearly states that T9000 exfiltrates data including Skype communications and files from removable drives.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that T9000 customizes its installation to avoid 24 identified security products and uses multi-stage installation with checks to detect analysis by security researchers.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that the malware would first evade detection and then proceed to exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The malware gains initial access and executes, setting up persistence and evading detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware customizes its installation to avoid detection by security products and researchers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - After ensuring it is not detected, the malware exfiltrates data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives.

### Final Answer
Given the sequence of actions described in the CTI report, it is likely that T9000 targets Skype users and automatically captures data from removable media and steals sensitive files only after evading detection by customizing its installation to avoid analysis by security researchers and security products.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
