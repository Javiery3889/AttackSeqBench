### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance:**
  - **Masscan:** Used to identify potential entry points into medical infrastructure by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
  - **Specialized Search Engines (Shodan, Censys):** Used to find publicly available resources of medical organizations.
  - **Discovery of Non-Trivial Ports and Services:**
    - Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol.
    - Printers with web interfaces without authentication.

- **Others:**
  - Overview of threats affecting medical networks.
  - Statistics on malware presence in medical organizations.
  - Targeting of pharmaceutical organizations by APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
  - Recommendations for mitigating threats.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:** After identifying outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online, is it likely that reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces will be conducted during the discovery phase?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance Tools and Techniques:**
  - The CTI report explicitly mentions the use of masscan and specialized search engines (Shodan, Censys) for identifying potential entry points and publicly available resources.
  - The report also highlights the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, including Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

- **Context of Outdated Medical Devices:**
  - The question mentions identifying outdated medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol and discoverable online. This aligns with the reconnaissance efforts described in the report, as these devices are likely to be part of the publicly available resources that can be identified using tools like masscan and specialized search engines.

- **Discovery Phase:**
  - The discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves identifying and mapping the target network, which includes finding vulnerable devices and services. The activities described in the report (using masscan, identifying Building Management systems, and unauthenticated printer web interfaces) are consistent with the discovery phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report clearly outlines the use of masscan and specialized search engines to identify potential entry points and publicly available resources.
  - The report also mentions the discovery of non-trivial ports and services, which aligns with the activities described in the question.
  - The discovery phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework involves identifying and mapping the target network, which includes the activities mentioned in the question.
  - Therefore, it is highly likely that reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces will be conducted during the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
