### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The initial infection vector remains unknown.
- First evidence of Harvester activity: Discovery of a malicious URL on victim machines.

**Execution:**
- Deployment of Backdoor.Graphon, a custom downloader, and a custom screenshot tool.
- These tools execute commands, capture user activities, and facilitate remote access.

**Persistence:**
- Custom downloader sets a registry value for persistence: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\"MicrosoftSystemServices"= "[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\Microsoft Services[.]vbs"

**Defense Evasion:**
- Blending malicious activities with legitimate network traffic.
- Leveraging legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
- Using a decoy URL, hxxps://usedust[.]com, to confuse affected users.

**Collection:**
- Custom screenshot tool captures screenshots and saves them to a password-protected ZIP archive.
- Archives older than a week are deleted.

**Exfiltration:**
- Captured screenshots are saved to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.

**Others:**
- Espionage effort with custom backdoors, steps to hide malicious activity, and targeting specific sectors and geographies.
- Most recent activity observed in October 2021.
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team investigates and enhances protection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection, is it likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will utilize the FTP protocol for C2 communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **C2 Communication:** The report mentions that Harvester leverages legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
- **Defense Evasion:** The group uses techniques to blend malicious activities with legitimate network traffic and employs a decoy URL to confuse users.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This would imply that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon use FTP for C2 communication.
  - However, the report specifically states that Harvester uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities, which suggests a more sophisticated and stealthy approach.
  - FTP is a less stealthy protocol and is more likely to be detected by network security systems.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This aligns with the report's description of Harvester's C2 communication methods.
  - Using legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities is more consistent with the group's efforts to blend in and avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that Harvester uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
- This approach is more sophisticated and aligns with the group's efforts to evade detection.
- Using FTP for C2 communication would be less stealthy and more likely to be detected, which contradicts the group's known tactics.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
