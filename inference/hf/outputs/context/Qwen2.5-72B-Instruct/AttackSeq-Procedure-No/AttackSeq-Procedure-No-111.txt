### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishing communication channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Removing the data from the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data through the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that persistence points are installed to ensure ongoing access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly state the order of lateral movement, but it implies that lateral movement is a critical step for spreading across the network.
   - **Discovery:** The report clearly states that discovery is required to locate systems, users, and data relevant to the mission.
   - **Logical Sequence:** It is logical that attackers would first discover the network to understand the layout and identify valuable targets before attempting lateral movement. This ensures that their efforts are directed efficiently and effectively.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The attackers gain initial access and execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They install persistence points to ensure they can maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They escalate privileges to gain more control.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They bypass defense mechanisms to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** They obtain valid credentials to move laterally and access data.
   - **Discovery:** They explore the network to understand the layout and identify valuable targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After discovery, they use the obtained credentials and knowledge to move laterally to other systems.
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:** They collect and exfiltrate the relevant data.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence and the importance of discovery in understanding the network layout, it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services for lateral movement only after gaining knowledge of systems, users, and data relevant to their mission through the discovery phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
