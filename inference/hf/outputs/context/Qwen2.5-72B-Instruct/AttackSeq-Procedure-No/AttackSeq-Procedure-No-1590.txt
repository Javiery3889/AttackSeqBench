### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms and hijacking execution flow to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca will use pass the ticket methods to engage in lateral movement after using scanning tools and commands during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands like `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443` to discover machines in the network.
   - **Credential Access:** The report also mentions that Earth Lusca targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon and Mimikatz to retrieve credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** While the report does not explicitly mention pass the ticket methods, it is a common technique used by threat actors to move laterally within a network after obtaining credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery and Credential Access:** The use of scanning tools and commands during the discovery phase indicates that Earth Lusca is actively mapping the network and identifying potential targets.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** The report clearly states that Earth Lusca targeted user credentials using various tools and exploits.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Given that they have obtained credentials, it is highly likely that they will use these credentials to move laterally within the network. Pass the ticket is a common method for lateral movement, especially when Kerberos tickets are involved.
