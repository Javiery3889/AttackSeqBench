### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - Documents designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails with a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
     - Document contains VBS macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - PowerShell script executed by the macro operates in memory.
     - Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
     - Leverages DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving to disk.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers.
     - Uses DownloadString and DownloadData methods to contact and download from C2 servers.
   - **Impact:**
     - Payloads are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
     - GandCrab encrypts files.
     - Ursnif performs credential harvesting, gathers system and process information, and potentially deploys additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the Report:**
     - The PowerShell script uses a DCOM object (C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880) to execute files without saving to disk.
     - The script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads.
     - Ursnif malware is known to gather system and process information.
   - **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
     - **Choice A: Yes**
       - The DCOM object is used to execute files, which aligns with the question's mention of a COM object.
       - The PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads, which includes Ursnif and GandCrab.
       - Ursnif is known to gather system information, which fits the query execution part of the question.
     - **Choice B: No**
       - This choice would imply that the COM object does not execute queries to gather system information or download payloads, which contradicts the information in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the PowerShell script uses a DCOM object to execute files in memory.
   - The script communicates with C2 servers to download payloads, which are identified as Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - Ursnif is known to gather system and process information, which aligns with the query execution part of the question.
   - Therefore, it is likely that a COM object will execute queries to gather system information and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
