### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- Acquired domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org)
- Developed malware (Graphite malware) and tools (Empire)
- Domains used as command and control (C2) servers

**Initial Access:**
- Sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx)
- Exploited CVE-2021-40444 in Microsoft Office to execute code

**Execution:**
- Exploited CVE-2021-40444 for client execution
- Used PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for execution

**Persistence:**
- Hijacked references to COM objects (CLSID: D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D)
- Created a local account (net user /add user1)

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal malicious payloads

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After employing reflective code loading with the Empire DLL Launcher stager to evade defenses, is it likely that the adversaries will use secondary C2 servers for communication after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers acquired multiple domains to serve as C2 servers.
- They used Empire tools, which are known for their flexibility and ability to communicate with C2 servers.
- Reflective code loading is used to evade detection, but it does not inherently dictate the use of secondary C2 servers.

**Reasoning:**
- The use of multiple domains suggests that the attackers have the capability to use secondary C2 servers.
- Reflective code loading is a technique to evade detection, but it does not preclude the use of additional C2 servers for redundancy and reliability.
- In many sophisticated attacks, adversaries often use multiple C2 servers to ensure continuous communication and to avoid detection if one server is compromised.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the context of the CTI report and the typical behavior of sophisticated threat actors, it is likely that the adversaries will use secondary C2 servers for communication after establishing connectivity and relaying victim information to primary C2 servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
