### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then checks the .NET version and drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses Base64 encoding and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Discovery:** Collects system information, running processes, open ports, registered proxies, and data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sayad malware is likely to capture screenshots as part of its data collection efforts only after performing discovery by collecting system and application details from the compromised host.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report clearly states that Sayad collects a wide range of information from the compromised host, including system information, running processes, open ports, registered proxies, and data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that Sayad uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - **Screenshots:** The report does not explicitly mention that Sayad captures screenshots. However, it does mention that Sayad collects a wide range of information, which could potentially include screenshots, but this is not specified.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide explicit information about the malware capturing screenshots. The focus is on the collection of system and application details, which is part of the discovery phase.
   - The sequence of events described in the report does not indicate that capturing screenshots is a necessary step after discovery and before exfiltration.
   - Given the information provided, it is more likely that the malware focuses on the data collection and exfiltration of the information it is designed to gather, which includes system and application details but does not explicitly mention screenshots.

### Final Answer
