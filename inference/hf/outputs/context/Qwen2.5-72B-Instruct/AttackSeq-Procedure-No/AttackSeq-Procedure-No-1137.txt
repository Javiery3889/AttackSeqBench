### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase 1:**
     - Duration: 1-2 years
     - Activities:
       - Fake personas on social platforms to gather identifiable information.
       - Use of social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents.
   - **Reconnaissance Phase 2:**
     - Duration: 6 months
     - Activities:
       - Long-term monitoring of targets via benign emails.
       - Sending daily emails duplicating local media content to build a relationship.
       - Tracking via tools like Wasmyemailread[.]com and ifread[.]com.
   - **Initial Access Phase 3:**
     - Duration: 1 day
     - Activities:
       - Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset.
       - SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages.
       - Domain typo squatting.
       - Use of HTTPS on credential harvesting landing pages with free SSL certificates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will send emails mimicking legit password recovery pages or use SMS to redirect to credential harvesting landing pages employing HTTPS with free SSL certificates **before** the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phases:**
     - The Reconnaissance phases (1 and 2) focus on gathering information and building a relationship with the target.
     - Activities include creating fake personas, stealing contact lists, sending benign emails, and tracking email opens.
   - **Initial Access Phase:**
     - The Initial Access phase involves sending emails and SMS to harvest credentials.
     - This phase occurs **after** the Reconnaissance phases.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The activities described in the Initial Access phase (sending emails mimicking password recovery and using SMS to redirect to credential harvesting pages) are clearly stated to occur **after** the Reconnaissance phases.
   - The Reconnaissance phases are focused on gathering information and building trust, which are necessary steps before attempting to harvest credentials.
