- **Technique:** Exploitation of a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604)
- **Details:** Installation of webshells, including AntSword.

**Execution:**
- **Tactic:** Execution
- **Technique:** Use of AntSword webshell to run commands, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, atexec).

**Defense Evasion:**
- **Tactic:** Defense Evasion
- **Technique:** Use of custom Mimikatz with .NET loader, Dumpert tool for direct system calls and API unhooking.

**Credential Access:**
- **Tactic:** Credential Access
- **Technique:** Use of Mimikatz to dump credentials, Impacket tools for pass the hash.

**Discovery:**
- **Tactic:** Discovery
- **Technique:** Running commands for system and network discovery.

**Lateral Movement:**
- **Tactic:** Lateral Movement
- **Technique:** Using webshells, Mimikatz, and Impacket's atexec to move laterally.

**Others:**
- **Details:** Palo Alto Networks protection, IPS signatures, and WildFire detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- **Before utilizing the AntSword webshell and AntSword Shell Manager for communicating with the compromised server and running commands under Command and Control, is it likely that the threat actors used Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive to host malicious downloads?**

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploited SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
2. **Execution:** Used AntSword webshell to run commands and upload tools.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Used custom Mimikatz and Dumpert to evade detection.
4. **Credential Access:** Dumped credentials using Mimikatz and used Impacket tools for pass the hash.
5. **Discovery:** Ran commands for system and network discovery.
6. **Lateral Movement:** Moved laterally using webshells, Mimikatz, and Impacket's atexec.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report does not mention the use of Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive for hosting malicious downloads.
  - The tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, atexec) were uploaded directly to the server using the AntSword webshell.
- **B: No**
  - The report clearly states that the tools were uploaded directly to the server using the AntSword webshell.
  - There is no indication of using external cloud storage services for hosting malicious downloads.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the initial access, execution, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, and lateral movement.
- The report explicitly states that the threat actors used the AntSword webshell to upload tools directly to the compromised server.
- There is no mention of using Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive to host malicious downloads.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that the threat actors used these cloud storage services for hosting malicious downloads.

**Final Answer: B: No**
