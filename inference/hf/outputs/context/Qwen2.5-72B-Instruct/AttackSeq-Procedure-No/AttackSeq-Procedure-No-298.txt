### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack used a JavaScript-based exploit targeting Internet Explorer 6.
- The exploit involved a heap spray attack and shellcode injection.
- A secondary payload was downloaded from a server.
- The dropper, once executed, would delete itself.

**Execution:**
- The malware's execution involved a two-stage installation.
- The dropper installed the payload as a service.
- The payload accessed an encrypted embedded resource to obtain the C&C server DNS name.

**Persistence:**
- The malware achieved persistence by installing itself as a service under random names.
- It modified registry keys.
- The dropper decompressed an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 directory and loaded it as a service.
- Registry keys were created and then deleted as part of the process.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The dropper modified the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL.
- The DLL was loaded into its own svchost.exe process.
- The dropper deleted itself using a dissolving batch file.

**Others:**
- The report attributes the operation to Chinese origins.
- It provides detection methods and discusses global activity and remediation strategies.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after modifying the file-time of the dropped DLL to match that of an existing system DLL and loading the DLL into its own svchost.exe process to evade detection, it is likely that the Aurora malware will communicate to servers operated by Google using the Jabber/XMPP protocol for C2.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses a C&C server, but the specific protocol or server details are not mentioned.
- The report does not provide any information about the use of Jabber/XMPP or Google servers for C2.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
- **B: No**

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not mention any specific C2 protocol or server used by the Aurora malware.
- The report focuses on the technical details of the initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion techniques.
- There is no indication that the malware uses Jabber/XMPP or Google servers for C2.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not provide any information about the C2 protocol or server used by the Aurora malware.
- The report focuses on the technical details of the attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, and defense evasion.
- Given the lack of specific information about the C2 protocol or server, it is not likely that the Aurora malware uses Jabber/XMPP or Google servers for C2.

**Final Answer: B: No**
