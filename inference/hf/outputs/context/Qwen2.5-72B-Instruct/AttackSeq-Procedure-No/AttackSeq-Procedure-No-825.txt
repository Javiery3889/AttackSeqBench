### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular.
     - Functionality depends on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted victim systems.
     - Modules are used for espionage and reconnaissance.
     - A 'mini' backdoor is deployed before admin rights are obtained, followed by the full version.
     - C&C servers are active Tor relays for operational security.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Infection vectors: spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
     - Lateral movement from compromised web servers to other workstations.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Stealth techniques: selective module deployment, partial encryption, fileless execution.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Use of tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Deploy internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to external C&C servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework with functionality defined by uploaded modules after securing access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report clearly states that GreyEnergy's malware framework is modular and that functionality is defined by the combination of modules uploaded to targeted systems.
   - **Initial Access and Reconnaissance:**
     - GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and web server compromise to gain initial access.
     - Once access is secured, they perform reconnaissance and gather host information.
   - **Modular Framework:**
     - After gaining access and performing reconnaissance, GreyEnergy deploys a 'mini' backdoor and then the full version of the malware, which is modular.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Initial Access → Reconnaissance → Deployment of 'mini' backdoor → Deployment of full modular malware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework.
   - After gaining initial access and performing reconnaissance, GreyEnergy deploys a 'mini' backdoor and then the full version of the malware.
   - The full version of the malware is modular, with functionality defined by the uploaded modules.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that after securing access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering, GreyEnergy will proceed to use a modular malware framework with functionality defined by uploaded modules.
