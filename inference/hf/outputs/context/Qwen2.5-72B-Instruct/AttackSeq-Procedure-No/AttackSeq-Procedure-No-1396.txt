### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and email communications with MAILSLOT.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil.
   - **Credential Access:** Process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to collect data from the victim's clipboard and stage it for eventual fraudulent transactions after using WMI for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report confirms that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools. However, it does not explicitly mention collecting data from the victim's clipboard.
   - **Credential Access and Defense Evasion:** The report details various methods for credential access and defense evasion, but clipboard data collection is not specifically mentioned.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While FIN13 is known for collecting and exfiltrating sensitive data, the report does not provide evidence that they specifically target clipboard data.
   - The focus of FIN13 is on mapping networks, capturing credentials, and stealing documents to facilitate fraudulent transactions. Clipboard data collection is not a common or explicitly mentioned technique in the report.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report and the specific techniques mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that clipboard data collection is not a primary method used by FIN13.
