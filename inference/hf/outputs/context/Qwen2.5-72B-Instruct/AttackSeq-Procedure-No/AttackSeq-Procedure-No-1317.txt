### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** The malware gains initial access through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes by running a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses Base64 encoding for strings and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. It also gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sayad malware is likely to collect keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media only after gathering system information, open ports, and browser data during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the Sayad malware collects a wide range of information from the compromised host, including system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. It also gathers data from browsers, messengers, and other applications.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report mentions that the malware uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.
   - **Additional Data Collection:** The report does not explicitly state that the malware collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media. However, it is common for malware to collect such data as part of its data exfiltration capabilities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase is described as collecting a wide range of information, but it does not specifically mention keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media.
   - The exfiltration phase involves uploading the collected data, but it does not specify the exact types of data collected beyond what is mentioned in the discovery phase.
   - Given the nature of the malware and its capabilities, it is plausible that the malware could collect additional data such as keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media, but the report does not provide explicit evidence that this happens only after the discovery phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The report does not provide explicit evidence that the Sayad malware collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, screenshots, and data from removable media only after the discovery phase. While it is possible that the malware collects such data, the report does not specify this sequence.
