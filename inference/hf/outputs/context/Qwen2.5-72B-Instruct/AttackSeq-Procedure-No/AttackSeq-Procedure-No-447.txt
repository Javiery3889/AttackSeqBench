### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Exploiting public-facing applications (e.g., FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection).
- Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Deploying custom malware, including the .NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper'.
- 'IPsec Helper' is registered as a service for persistence.
- Capabilities: Exfiltrate data, deploy additional malware, execute commands, upload files, update configuration based on C2 commands.

**Persistence:**
- Deploying webshells.
- Registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Using webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, obfuscated with custom base64 encoding.
- 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic.
- Leveraging compromised accounts and offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Configuration file contains encrypted server addresses.
- Awaits commands for updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy the 'Apostle' wiper and 'DEADWOOD' malware for data destruction activities before the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor awaits commands from C2 servers to send recon information or download files.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access and Execution:**
  - Agrius gains initial access and deploys the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
  - The backdoor is registered as a service and can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

- **Persistence and Defense Evasion:**
  - Webshells and 'IPsec Helper' are used for persistence and defense evasion.
  - 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces of itself.

- **Lateral Movement and Command and Control:**
  - Webshells are used for lateral movement and tunneling RDP traffic.
  - 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers and awaits commands for various actions, including sending recon information and downloading files.

- **Data Destruction:**
  - The report does not mention the deployment of 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware.
  - The focus is on initial access, persistence, lateral movement, and command and control activities.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not indicate that Agrius deploys 'Apostle' wiper or 'DEADWOOD' malware as part of its initial or subsequent activities.
- The primary focus of the report is on gaining initial access, establishing persistence, evading defenses, moving laterally, and maintaining command and control.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is described as awaiting commands from C2 servers to perform various tasks, but data destruction activities are not mentioned.

**Final Answer: B: No**
