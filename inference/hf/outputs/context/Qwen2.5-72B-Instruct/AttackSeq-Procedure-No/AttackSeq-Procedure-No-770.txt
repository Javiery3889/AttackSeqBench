### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Tortoiseshell created a fake veteran hiring website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com) to conduct reconnaissance.
     - The website prompted users to download an app, which was a malware downloader.
     - The downloaded reconnaissance tool, named 'bird.exe' with the internal name Liderc, collected extensive information from the victim's machine using WMI.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website.
     - The app served as a malware downloader.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware downloader executed two binaries retrieved from a remote server.
     - These binaries included a reconnaissance tool and a Remote Administrative Tool (RAT), which was executed as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
     - The RAT was modular and required the installer for access, complicating analysis.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' collected detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The RAT communicated with a C2 server, with the IP address provided as an argument to the service.
     - This design prevented direct access to the C2 server without the installer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Tortoiseshell is likely to use cron to create pre-scheduled and periodic background jobs on a Linux system for persistence before employing the RAT to maintain communication with the C2 server using a provided IP address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The attack started with a fake website and a malware downloader, which is consistent with the report.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware downloader retrieved and executed two binaries, one of which was a RAT.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked for network connectivity and used modular design to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool collected detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The RAT communicated with a C2 server using a provided IP address.

   - **Persistence:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of cron jobs for persistence on a Linux system. The report focuses on the execution of the RAT as a service, which is a common method for maintaining persistence on Windows systems.
     - The use of cron jobs for persistence is more typical in Linux environments, but the report does not provide any evidence that Tortoiseshell used this method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report describes the use of a service for persistence on Windows systems.
   - There is no mention of Linux systems or the use of cron jobs in the report.
   - The question asks about the likelihood of using cron jobs on a Linux system, which is not supported by the information provided in the report.
