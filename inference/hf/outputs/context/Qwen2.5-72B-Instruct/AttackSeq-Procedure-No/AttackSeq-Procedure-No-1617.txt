### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Regin can use various infection vectors, including spoofed websites, web browser exploits, and application exploits. It was also observed to originate from Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin has a multi-staged architecture with six stages, each with specific roles in the infection and execution process.
   - **Persistence:** While not explicitly detailed, the multi-staged architecture and use of kernel drivers and EVFS containers suggest long-term persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself, including encrypted data storage in non-traditional areas.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic for credential information.
   - **Discovery:** Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization, scans for deleted files, and retrieves them. It also monitors network traffic to IIS web servers and collects administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin has extensive C&C capabilities, including bidirectional communication and the use of various transport protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin is likely to gather information on processes and memory utilization and scan for deleted files during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase in the CTI Report:**
     - The report explicitly states that Regin's discovery capabilities include:
       - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
       - Scanning for deleted files and retrieving them.
       - Monitoring network traffic to IIS web servers and collecting administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Question Context:**
     - The question specifically asks about gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.
     - Both of these activities are mentioned in the discovery phase of the CTI report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that Regin's discovery phase includes gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files.
   - Therefore, the activities mentioned in the question are consistent with the discovery phase described in the CTI report.
