### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
   - **Execution:**
     - The HTA file contained a script that checked for installed antivirus software using WMI and communicated with the C2 server.
     - If no antivirus software was detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe, which was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and instead used VBS.
     - The backdoor employed DLL sideloading using cmpbk32.dll to execute Srvstr.exe.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products on the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the WMI check for installed antivirus software occurs only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server and leverages webserv-redir.net for Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. **Initial Access:**
        - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document to download an HTA file.
     2. **Execution:**
        - The HTA file checks for installed antivirus software using WMI.
        - The HTA file communicates with the C2 server.
        - If no antivirus software is detected, it runs the backdoor.
     3. **Persistence:**
        - The backdoor creates a Run key in the registry.
     4. **Defense Evasion:**
        - The HTA file avoids using PowerShell and uses VBS.
        - The backdoor uses DLL sideloading.
     5. **Discovery:**
        - The HTA file uses WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

   - **Key Points:**
     - The WMI check for installed antivirus software is mentioned before the communication with the C2 server.
     - The sequence in the report suggests that the WMI check is part of the initial execution phase, not after the C2 communication.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The WMI check for installed antivirus software does not occur only after the HTA file communicates with the C2 server. It is part of the initial execution phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
