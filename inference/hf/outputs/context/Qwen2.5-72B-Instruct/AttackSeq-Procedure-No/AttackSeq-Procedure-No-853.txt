### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Dexphot wrote five key files to disk: an installer with two URLs, an MSI package file, a password-protected ZIP archive, a loader DLL, and an encrypted data file containing three additional executables.
- These executables were loaded into system processes via **process hollowing**.
- Targeted legitimate system processes included msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, powershell.exe, svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe.

**Persistence:**
- Ensured persistence through dual monitoring services that checked the status of all three malicious processes and re-infected the device if any were terminated.
- Used schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection.
- Employed techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.
- The tasks called msiexec.exe as a proxy to run the malicious code and updated Dexphot's components upon system reboot and every 90 or 110 minutes while the system was running.

**Others:**
- Microsoft Defender ATP Research Team, led by Hazel Kim, monitored the Dexphot threat for over a year.
- The team observed the malware's evolution, the attackers' efforts to upgrade the malware, target new processes, and work around defensive measures.
- Microsoft Defender ATP's behavioral blocking and containment capabilities were crucial in stopping the Dexphot campaign.
- Insights into the goals and motivations of Dexphot's authors contributed to a broader understanding of cybercriminal behavior.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing fileless techniques for defense evasion to prevent detection and obfuscate its activities, is Dexphot likely to use process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes.
- This technique is part of the execution stage and is used to evade detection and obfuscate activities.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report explicitly states that Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage.
  - This aligns with the question's context of using fileless techniques for defense evasion and obfuscation.
- **B: No**
  - This answer is incorrect because the report clearly indicates that process hollowing was used.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides detailed information about the execution stage of the Dexphot attack.
- It explicitly mentions that Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes.
- This technique is consistent with the goal of evading detection and obfuscating activities, which aligns with the use of fileless techniques.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Dexphot is likely to use process hollowing during the execution stage.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
