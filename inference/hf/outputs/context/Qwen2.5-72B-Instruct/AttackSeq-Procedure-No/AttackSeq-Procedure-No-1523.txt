### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from other government-related entities. The attachments contained weaponized copies of legitimate-looking official documents that employed the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files used in the attack were weaponized using a variant of a tool named RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word. The initial documents and RTF files initiated a multi-stage infection chain, ultimately leading to the execution of malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that was intended to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day. This task was set up by the shellcode within the RTF document to maintain the foothold on the system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain. The loader used anti-sandboxing techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server. The loader also decrypted and executed shellcode that was stored encrypted within the binary, using dynamic API resolving to hide its main functionality and avoid static detection of suspicious API calls.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information. This data was collected for the attackers to assess the value of the compromised machine.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted and followed a specific format involving XORed TypeID and Data with a 256-byte key.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel. The communication protocol involved sending various types of data, including screenshots, files, and system information, back to the attackers through the established C&C channel.
   - **Impact:** The backdoor had the capability to shut down the victim's computer, which could be used to disrupt operations and impact the availability of the system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the loader will gather detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, MAC addresses, and anti-virus information via WMI queries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including:
     - Hostname
     - OS name and version
     - System type
     - User name
     - MAC addresses of networking adapters
   - Additionally, the report mentions that the loader queried WMI for anti-virus information.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The loader does indeed gather detailed information about the victim's computer, including the specified details, and it uses WMI queries to gather anti-virus information.
   - Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
