### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Iranian state-backed hackers targeted individuals involved in sanctions against Iran, politicians, activists, and journalists.
- Collected information on targets prior to phishing attacks, tailoring their approach based on the target's cyber knowledge, contacts, activities, working time, and geographic location.

**Initial Access:**
- Used phishing attacks through unknown email or social media accounts and compromised accounts of public figures.
- Sent fake security alerts from email addresses like notifications.mailservices@gmail[.]com and noreply.customermails@gmail[.]com, claiming unauthorized access attempts.
- Created fake Google Drive download pages to trick users into entering their credentials.

**Persistence:**
- Did not change the passwords of the victim's accounts, allowing them to remain undetected and monitor communications in real-time.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- Used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images.
- Used a hidden tracking image in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.

**Others:**
- The campaign's phishing infrastructure included over 20 domain names set up between September and November 2018.
- Technical reviews indicated that the attackers used VPNs and proxies with Dutch and French IP addresses but were traced back to real Iranian IP addresses during the preparation phase.
- The campaign is linked to the Charming Kitten group, known for its connections to the Iranian government.
- The campaign coincides with the U.S. imposing new sanctions on Iran on November 4, 2018, and aims to infiltrate accounts of individuals working on sanctions against Iran.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the attackers verify victims' credentials in real-time and prompt for the 2-step verification code, will they then use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- They used third-party services like Firefox Screenshot to host these images.
- They used a hidden tracking image in emails to alert the attackers when a target opened the email.

**Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
- Verify victims' credentials in real-time.
- Prompt for the 2-step verification code.
- Use images instead of text in phishing emails to evade Google's security systems.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the attackers used images instead of text in phishing emails to bypass Google's security systems.
- The report does not explicitly state the sequence of using images after verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes.
- However, the use of images to evade detection is a consistent tactic used by the attackers throughout the campaign.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The attackers' primary goal is to evade detection and maintain access to the victims' accounts.
- Using images instead of text in phishing emails is a known tactic to bypass Google's security systems.
- The sequence of verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes is a logical step in the attack process to gain full access to the account.
- Given the attackers' consistent use of evasion techniques, it is plausible that they would continue to use images in phishing emails even after verifying credentials and prompting for 2-step verification codes.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
