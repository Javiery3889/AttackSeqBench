### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated the second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server modified the payload to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will perform discovery activities to collect system and network information after communicating with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The report clearly states that the malware performed discovery activities to collect system and network information. This is a critical step in the attack sequence to understand the environment and plan further actions.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The report mentions that the C2 servers used a custom base64 alphabet and that the malware communicated with these servers. This communication is a necessary step before performing further actions, including discovery.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence of TTPs in the report suggests that after gaining initial access and executing the malware, the next logical steps are to communicate with the C2 server and then perform discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware TDrop2, after gaining initial access and executing, communicates with the C2 server using encrypted and base64-encoded commands with a custom base64 alphabet.
   - Once communication with the C2 server is established, the malware performs discovery activities to gather system and network information.
   - This sequence aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where reconnaissance and discovery are crucial steps to understand the target environment and plan further actions.
