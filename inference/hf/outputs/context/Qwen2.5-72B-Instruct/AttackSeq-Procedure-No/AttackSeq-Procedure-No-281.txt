### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, delivered through an email attachment.
     - The zip file contains a file disguised as a Microsoft Word document icon, which is actually an application bundle containing executable code.
     - When the user attempts to open the decoy Word document, the Trojan executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor opens a hidden file named .CFUserEncoding from the application bundle's Resources folder.
     - It copies this file to the executable path, replacing the application bundle after persistence is established.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up.
     - It copies itself to a location and filename based on the user's UID, using a segmented MD5 hash as a directory.
     - The malware deletes the original application bundle, leaving the decoy document, and launches itself as a service from the new location.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor avoids the use of command line utilities and suspicious strings.
     - It employs a robust string encoding mechanism to obfuscate its functions.
     - The malware uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server.
     - It gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which is then encrypted and sent to the command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information for transmission to its server after initiating command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control Communication:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report explicitly states that the backdoor surveys the victim's computer and gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which is then encrypted and sent to the command and control server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the backdoor performs discovery activities to gather victim information.
   - The report also mentions that this information is encrypted and sent to the command and control server.
   - The question aligns with the sequence described in the report, where the backdoor initiates command and control communication and then performs discovery activities.
