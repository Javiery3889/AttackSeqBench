### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Smoaler malware arrives via RTF files with Tibetan-themed subject lines.
- These files exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.
- Upon opening, the RTF file executes shellcode.

**Execution:**
- The shellcode decompresses an embedded PE file.
- The decompressed PE file is written to the %TEMP% folder as DW20.DLL.
- The shellcode then executes DW20.DLL.
- A first-stage dropper creates another program file, drops it to disk, and runs it.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Smoaler overwrites the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file to remove evidence of infection.
- It injects itself into the IEXPLORE.EXE process to make its traffic appear to originate from a browser.
- Smoaler avoids injecting into Internet Explorer if security product processes are active.

**Command and Control:**
- C&C server names are saved to the registry entry HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows Media\XC.
- The malware attempts to connect to its C&C servers.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Smoaler is likely to establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon only after executing its embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Smoaler writes the decompressed PE file to the %TEMP% folder as DW20.DLL and executes it.
- After execution, it overwrites the infected RTF file with a decoy DOC file.
- It injects itself into the IEXPLORE.EXE process and saves C&C server names to the registry.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - Smoaler is likely to establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon only after executing its embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.
- **B: No** - Smoaler is not likely to establish persistence by using rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon only after executing its embedded payload by writing it to the %TEMP% folder and running it.

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of rundll32.exe for persistence.
- The report focuses on the initial execution and defense evasion techniques.
- The report does mention that Smoaler saves C&C server names to the registry, which could be a form of persistence, but it does not specify the use of rundll32.exe.

Given the information provided, there is no direct evidence that Smoaler uses rundll32.exe for persistence. The report primarily describes the initial infection, execution, and defense evasion techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not mention the use of rundll32.exe for persistence.
- The report focuses on the initial infection, execution, and defense evasion techniques.
- The report does not provide evidence that Smoaler uses rundll32.exe for automatic re-loading upon system reboot or user logon.

**Final Answer: B: No**
