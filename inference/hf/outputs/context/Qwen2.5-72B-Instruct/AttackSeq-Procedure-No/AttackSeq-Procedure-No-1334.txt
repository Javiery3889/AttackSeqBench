### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks.
   - **Resource Development:** They developed a sophisticated arsenal, including custom-built tools and modified publicly-available tools.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial penetration vector was social engineering through spear-phishing emails with links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents.
   - **Execution:** They used fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads.
   - **Persistence:** They established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They exploited DLL hijacking vulnerabilities and used DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They performed lateral movement using stolen credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They expanded control within the network using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus Group will use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for command-and-control communication before performing lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows built-in tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS Tunneling vs. DNS over HTTPS:**
     - The CTI report explicitly mentions that the OceanLotus Group used DNS Tunneling as a command-and-control communication method. DNS Tunneling involves encoding data in DNS queries and responses, which is a different technique from DNS over HTTPS (DoH).
     - DoH is a more modern and secure method of DNS resolution that encrypts DNS queries and responses, making it harder to monitor and block. However, the report does not mention the use of DoH.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report clearly states that the OceanLotus Group performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools after establishing a foothold and harvesting credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides detailed information about the techniques used by the OceanLotus Group, including the use of DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication.
   - There is no mention of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in the report.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report aligns with the use of DNS Tunneling followed by lateral movement using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
