### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, opening a decoy file, and running the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating running processes, gathering browser data (bookmarks, window names, keylogger info).
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, encrypting and staging data.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication, fallback to HTTP for exfiltration, downloading additional files.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, compressing browser profile data, scheduled transfers, copying data to removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Machete will deploy a network sniffer module to discover user credentials being sent over the network after enumerating running processes and gathering browser data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report mentions that Machete enumerates running processes and gathers browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials.
   - **Collection Activities:** The report details that Machete collects data by logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and stealing clipboard contents. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a network sniffer module.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Machete exfiltrates collected data, including browser profile data, but does not mention network sniffing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery and Collection:** Machete's discovery and collection activities are comprehensive, including gathering browser data and logging keystrokes. These methods are effective for collecting user credentials.
   - **Network Sniffing:** While network sniffing can be a powerful technique for intercepting credentials, the report does not indicate that Machete uses this method. The focus is on more direct methods of credential collection, such as keylogging and browser data extraction.
   - **Plausibility:** Given the detailed methods already employed by Machete for credential collection, it is less likely that the malware would deploy a network sniffer module as an additional step. The existing methods are sufficient and more aligned with the reported TTPs.
