### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** ShadowPad is deployed using a DLL loader that is sideloaded by a legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. The DLL loader decrypts and executes the ShadowPad payload in memory.
   - **Execution:** ShadowPad is decrypted in memory and performs various actions such as extracting host information, executing commands, interacting with the file system and registry, and deploying new modules. It copies the legitimate binary and sideloaded DLL to a subdirectory and sets up a Windows service to initiate the execution chain.
   - **Defense Evasion:** ShadowPad uses techniques like DLL hijacking and padding the DLL loader to over 50MB to evade antivirus software.
   - **Command and Control:** ShadowPad injects the decrypted payload into a newly launched target process and establishes persistence via a service and a registry Run key.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ShadowPad is likely to configure Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER, specifying the `WantedBy=multi-user.target` configuration to run GOGETTER when the system begins accepting user logins.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:** The CTI report mentions that ShadowPad establishes persistence via a Windows service and a registry Run key. It does not mention any use of Systemd, which is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
   - **Target OS:** ShadowPad is described as targeting Windows systems, as evidenced by the use of Windows-specific techniques like DLL hijacking and registry manipulation.
   - **GOGETTER:** The report does not mention any malware or tool named GOGETTER. The focus is entirely on ShadowPad and its associated TTPs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Windows vs. Linux:** ShadowPad is a Windows-specific malware, and the report does not indicate any cross-platform capabilities or use of Linux-specific tools like Systemd.
   - **Persistence Methods:** The report clearly states that ShadowPad uses Windows services and registry keys for persistence, not Systemd.
   - **GOGETTER:** The report does not mention GOGETTER, so it is unlikely that ShadowPad would configure Systemd to maintain persistence for an unrelated tool.
