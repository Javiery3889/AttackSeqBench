### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - Documents designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access achieved through phishing emails with a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
     - The document contains embedded VBS macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - PowerShell script executed by the macro operates in memory.
     - Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
     - Leverages DCOM object to execute files without saving to disk.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers.
     - Uses DownloadString and DownloadData methods to contact and download from C2 servers.
   - **Impact:**
     - Payloads downloaded and executed are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
     - GandCrab encrypts files, Ursnif performs credential harvesting and gathers system information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the encoded PowerShell script will execute only after being retrieved via a VBS macro and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a phishing email with a Word document containing a VBS macro.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The VBS macro executes a PowerShell script that operates in memory.
     - The PowerShell script uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers to download the payloads.
   - **Impact:**
     - The payloads downloaded are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report.
   - The VBS macro in the Word document is the initial trigger that executes the PowerShell script.
   - The PowerShell script then downloads and executes the payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab).

### Final Answer
