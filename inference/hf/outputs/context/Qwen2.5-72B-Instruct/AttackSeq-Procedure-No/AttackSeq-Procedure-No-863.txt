### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components.
     - The URL led to an IP-address-based URL where the archived payload was located, containing an executable file and a decoy PDF document.
     - The executable, when run, prompted for a password and opened the decoy PDF, while the downloader written in Delphi continued to run in the background.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence, adding registry keys for a custom backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The operators used dumpers to target browsers and Microsoft Outlook, retrieving credentials from software like Firefox, The Bat! email client, and Opera.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - **Collection:**
     - The malware scanned for files with specific extensions and staged data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The downloaders and backdoors communicated with the C&C server using ports 80 or 443, with data hex-encoded and encrypted.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data were prepared and sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Sednit groupâ€™s operators will distribute Zebrocy components through spearphishing emails to gain initial access only after using a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access was gained through spearphishing emails with shortened URLs leading to the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence by adding custom registry keys.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The sequence described in the question suggests that the initial access is gained through spearphishing emails, and then a Stage-1 downloader is used to download and execute a new downloader.
     - The report indicates that the initial access is directly through the spearphishing email, which leads to the first stage of Zebrocy components. The downloader is part of this initial stage, not a separate step after gaining initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spearphishing emails, which deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components.
   - The first stage of Zebrocy components includes the downloader, which is part of the initial access mechanism.
   - The question suggests a sequence where the initial access is followed by a separate Stage-1 downloader, which is not supported by the report.
   - The report indicates that the downloader is part of the initial access, not a separate step.
