### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Execution:** FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** FamousSparrow created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. They also used DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FamousSparrow injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files or information.
   - **Credential Access:** FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would use cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor before acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor immediately after gaining Initial Access.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report does not mention any specific activities related to acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY. The focus is on the attack sequence and the use of SparrowDoor.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The logical sequence of actions based on the report is:
       1. Gain Initial Access.
       2. Use cmd.exe to download and install SparrowDoor.
       3. Establish Persistence.
       4. Evade Defenses.
       5. Access Credentials.
       6. Discover and Collect Information.
       7. Exfiltrate Data.
     - Acquiring infrastructure for Resource Development is not mentioned and would typically be a separate phase that might occur before or after the attack, but not as part of the immediate post-compromise activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the provided CTI report, it is clear that FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor immediately after gaining Initial Access. The report does not mention any activities related to acquiring infrastructure from the specified companies, and such activities would not be part of the immediate post-compromise sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
