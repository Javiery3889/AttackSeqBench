### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a phishing email impersonating a senior partner of a Brazilian law firm.
- The email contains a PowerPoint add-in document with a '.ppa' extension.
- The document includes an auto-open VBA macro designed to execute further malicious activities.

**Persistence:**
- The malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to run the 'mshta.exe' utility with the URL 'hxxps://pocasideiascdt.blogspot[.]com/' every two hours.

**Command and Control:**
- The 'RevengeRAT' payload, once executed, communicates with C2 servers at 'office365update[.]duckdns.org' and 'systen32.ddns[.]net'.

**Others:**
- Additional details about the 'Document.exe' file, 'Outlook.exe' payload, and shared infrastructure are provided, but they are secondary to the main attack sequence.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After a phishing email containing a malicious PowerPoint add-in document with an auto-open VBA macro is used to gain initial access, is it likely that the VBA macro will use a COM object to execute queries to gather system information before the malware establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task to execute 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
   - Auto-open VBA macro in the document.

2. **Persistence:**
   - Creation of a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

**Question Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Phishing email with a malicious PowerPoint add-in document.
   - Auto-open VBA macro in the document.

2. **System Information Gathering:**
   - VBA macro uses a COM object to execute queries to gather system information.

3. **Persistence:**
   - Creation of a scheduled task to run 'mshta.exe' with a specific URL every two hours.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention that the VBA macro uses a COM object to gather system information.
- The report focuses on the initial access via the VBA macro and the subsequent persistence mechanism.
- While it is common for malware to gather system information, the report does not provide evidence that this specific VBA macro does so before establishing persistence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the initial access and persistence mechanisms.
- There is no mention of the VBA macro using a COM object to gather system information before establishing persistence.
- Given the information provided, it is not likely that the VBA macro performs this additional step.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
