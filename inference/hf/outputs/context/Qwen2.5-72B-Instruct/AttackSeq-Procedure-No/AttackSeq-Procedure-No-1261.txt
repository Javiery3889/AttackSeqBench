### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used the SocGholish framework, found on over 150 compromised websites, to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
   - **Execution:**
     - The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector taken from an open-source project called Donut. This was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:**
     - The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption and ransom demands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. This is the first step in the attack sequence.
   - **Remote System Discovery:**
     - The report does not mention the use of `Get-NetComputer` or PowerView for remote system discovery before the initial compromise. Instead, the discovery-related activities (downloading additional PowerShell scripts) occur after the initial compromise.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The sequence of events in the report is:
       1. Reconnaissance (using SocGholish on compromised websites).
       2. Initial Access (via SocGholish framework).
       3. Execution (using Cobalt Strike and Donut).
       4. Privilege Escalation (using slui.exe and wmic.exe).
       5. Defense Evasion (using PsExec).
       6. Credential Access (using Cobalt Strike and ProcDump).
       7. Lateral Movement (using Cobalt Strike Beacon).
       8. Command and Control (using Cobalt Strike Beacon).
       9. Impact (deploying WastedLocker ransomware).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the sequence of events described in the CTI report, it is not likely that the attackers will use the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView for remote system discovery before using the SocGholish framework for initial compromise. The initial compromise is the first step, and remote system discovery activities occur after the initial access is established.

**Final Answer: B: No**
