### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is initially delivered via an SFX executable that displays a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** After execution, the malware checks the installed input language and decrypts an embedded resource. It sets up a scheduled task and collects system information.
   - **Persistence:** The malware sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses ConfuserEx for obfuscation and checks for anti-virus software.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system information using WMI queries.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and WSHttpBinding() API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the keylogger component will collect keystrokes and clipboard data only before storing them encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Component:** The report mentions that the keylogger component is not installed if any anti-virus software is detected. However, it does not specify where the keylogger stores its data.
   - **Storage Location:** The report states that the malware saves and encrypts parameters to a predefined location: `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`. This location is different from `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any information about the keylogger storing data in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.
   - The keylogger component is conditional and only installed if no anti-virus software is detected.
   - The storage location for the keylogger data is not specified in the report, and the only mentioned storage location is for the malware's parameters, which is `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`.
