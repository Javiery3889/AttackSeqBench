### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. The initial shellcode stage located and executed a secondary shellcode stub, which then decrypted and executed an embedded payload.
   - **Execution:** The payload used a legitimate Microsoft executable, igfxtray.exe, to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll. This DLL performed security product checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware was designed to evade detection by customizing its installation to avoid 24 identified security products and using multi-stage checks.
   - **Collection:** T9000 was configured to capture data about the infected system, steal files from removable media, and target Skype users by capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to steal sensitive data from Skype communications and removable drives during the collection phase after compressing and encrypting the stolen data for exfiltration over a C2 channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The CTI report clearly states that T9000 was configured to automatically capture data about the infected system, steal files from removable media, and target Skype users by capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and Skype communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic. This implies that the data is compressed and encrypted before exfiltration.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The collection of data (including from Skype and removable drives) is a part of the collection phase, which occurs before the data is exfiltrated. The exfiltration process involves compressing and encrypting the data, which is then sent to the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The collection phase includes stealing data from Skype communications and removable drives.
   - After collecting the data, it is compressed and encrypted for exfiltration.
   - The sequence of actions is: collection → compression and encryption → exfiltration.
