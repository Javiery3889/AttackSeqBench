### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** The group uses scripting (Batch files, VBScript) and rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs. They also use CreateProcess to execute payloads from C&C servers and rely on user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** They register modules as scheduled tasks, use Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder. They also insert malicious macros into existing documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use obfuscation, modify registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms, and employ code signing with valid certificates. They deobfuscate and decrypt strings and add remote templates to documents.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoors list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and use Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Modules upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using the Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, the group is likely to attempt to collect mail from accessed systems and servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that Gamaredon uses Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the group's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoors list interesting files, which could include email files, for future exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files (which could include email files) and that they exfiltrate harvested documents to the C&C server, it is highly likely that they would also collect and exfiltrate emails from accessed systems and servers.
   - The group's focus on exfiltrating sensitive information and their use of multiple techniques to gather and spread data suggest that collecting mail would be a logical step in their attack sequence.
