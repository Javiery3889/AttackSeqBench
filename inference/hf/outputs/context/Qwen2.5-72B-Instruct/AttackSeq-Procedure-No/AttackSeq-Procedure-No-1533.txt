### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with the delivery of an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild (ITW) URL. This ISO file contains a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Persistence:** The 'stopedge.bat' file schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scripts like 'install.vbs' and 'update.vbs' are heavily obfuscated, and 'stopedge.bat' deletes 'versioninfo.bat' and 'update.vbs' after execution.
   - **Discovery:** The 'versioninfo.bat' script gathers information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** The 'versioninfo.bat' script collects information and prepares it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The 'activate.vbs' script communicates with a C2 server, and 'resolvedns.bat' facilitates communication to download a file.
   - **Exfiltration:** The 'unactivate.vbs' script exfiltrates data, and 'versioninfo.bat' uses 'unactivate.vbs' to exfiltrate collected information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Konni APT Group will gain initial access by delivering an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL only after executing scripts including 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat' via various VBScripts and batch files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is achieved by delivering an ISO file downloaded from an in-the-wild URL. This is the starting point of the attack chain.
   - **Persistence and Other Scripts:** The 'stopedge.bat' file and other scripts like 'resolve.dns' are used for persistence and command and control, but they are not the initial entry point. They are part of the subsequent steps in the attack chain.
   - **Sequence of Events:** The sequence described in the question suggests that the initial access happens after the execution of 'resolve.dns' and 'stopedge.bat', which is incorrect based on the CTI report. The initial access is the first step, and the other scripts are used later in the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the initial access is achieved by delivering an ISO file from an in-the-wild URL.
   - The 'stopedge.bat' and 'resolve.dns' scripts are used for persistence and command and control, respectively, but they are not the initial entry point.
   - The question's proposed sequence is not aligned with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.
