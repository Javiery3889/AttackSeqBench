### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries use worms and scanning tools like masscan to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts.
     - They use public search engines like Shodan or Censys.
     - The function DOCKERGEDDON is used to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs, collect information about the host, and deploy a malicious container.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Built files on the host from base64.
     - Created public registry accounts that mimic popular software or packages to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - Massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, where crypto miners were executed during the auto-build of an image process.
   - **Execution:**
     - Abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Used cmd or entry point to execute commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Scheduled local jobs using the cron utility.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software to avoid detection.
     - Used obfuscated files or information.
     - Executed fileless malware attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials over the C2 server.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives such as backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft are emerging.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries would develop malicious npm packages for delivery to or retrieval by victims during the Resource Development phase after using functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - The report mentions the use of DOCKERGEDDON to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Resource Development Phase:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the development of malicious npm packages.
     - However, the report does mention the creation of public registry accounts that mimic popular software or packages to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The adversaries are known to use various methods to trick developers and gain initial access.
     - The use of malicious npm packages is a plausible method for delivering or retrieving malicious code, especially in the context of supply-chain attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversaries are already using methods to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
   - Developing malicious npm packages is a similar strategy to trick developers and gain initial access.
   - The report indicates that the adversaries are sophisticated and use multiple methods to achieve their objectives.
   - Given the context of the report, it is reasonable to infer that developing malicious npm packages is a likely next step in their attack strategy.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
