### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT42 engages in targeted spear phishing and surveillance, building trust with victims.
   - **Resource Development:** APT42 uses social engineering for credential harvesting and develops custom backdoors.
   - **Initial Access:** APT42 uses spear phishing to gain initial access, bypassing MFA and intercepting SMS-based one-time passwords.
   - **Execution:** APT42 establishes a foothold using lightweight malware and PowerShell/C# scripts.
   - **Persistence:** APT42 uses scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and MFA interception to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT42 uses custom malware for keylogging and stealing logins and cookies.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT42 employs obfuscation, process injection, and virtualization/sandbox evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** APT42 steals credentials using OS credential dumping, two-factor authentication interception, and keylogging.
   - **Discovery:** APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.
   - **Collection:** APT42 steals documents, tracks locations, and monitors communications.
   - **Command and Control:** APT42 uses web services and encrypted channels for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT42 exfiltrates data over C2 channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT42 is likely to use pass the hash for lateral movement after conducting internal reconnaissance and before sending spear-phishing emails to additional targets.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** The report states that APT42 conducts internal reconnaissance by browsing contacts and accessing collaborative spaces.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of pass the hash for lateral movement. However, it does mention that APT42 uses custom malware for privilege escalation and steals credentials.
   - **Spear Phishing:** The report indicates that APT42 uses spear phishing to target additional victims, leveraging trusted relationships.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Pass the Hash:** While APT42 is capable of stealing credentials and using them for privilege escalation, the report does not specifically mention the use of pass the hash. Pass the hash is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash to authenticate to a system without knowing the actual password. This technique is often used for lateral movement within a network.
   - **Spear Phishing:** The report clearly states that APT42 uses spear phishing to target additional victims, leveraging the victim's trusted relationships. This is a common tactic for expanding the attack surface and gaining access to more systems.

Given the information in the report, it is more likely that APT42 would use the stolen credentials to send spear-phishing emails to additional targets rather than using pass the hash for lateral movement. The report emphasizes the use of spear phishing and social engineering to build trust and gain access, which aligns more closely with the described sequence.
