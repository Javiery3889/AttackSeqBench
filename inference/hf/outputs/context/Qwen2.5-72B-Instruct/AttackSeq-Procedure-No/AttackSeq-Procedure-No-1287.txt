### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla spyware infects government computers, suggesting an Initial Access tactic.
   - **Persistence:** The malware establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks, allowing persistent access.
   - **Collection:** Turla's operators can download specialized tools onto an infected system, including password stealers, programs for gathering system information, and document stealers.
   - **Command and Control:** Turla uses multiple command and control servers to control infected systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Turla will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion only after its operators download specialized tools for Collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks, which is a form of Persistence. This hidden foothold is likely to include some form of Defense Evasion to avoid detection.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Turla's operators can download specialized tools for Collection, such as password stealers and document stealers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly state that a rootkit is used for Defense Evasion only after the Collection phase. However, it is common for advanced malware to include Defense Evasion techniques from the beginning to maintain stealth and persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The hidden foothold established by Turla for Persistence is likely to include Defense Evasion techniques to avoid detection from the start. This is a common practice in advanced malware to ensure that the malware remains undetected and can operate for extended periods.
   - The specialized tools for Collection are downloaded after the initial foothold is established, but the Defense Evasion techniques are likely to be in place from the beginning to protect the entire operation, including the Collection phase.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The malware is likely to include Defense Evasion techniques, such as a rootkit, from the initial stages of the attack to maintain stealth and persistence, rather than only after the Collection phase.
