### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Execution:**
  - Executes via a service (T1569.002)
  - Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)

- **Persistence:**
  - Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)

- **Defense Evasion:**
  - Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
  - Timestomps files (T1070.006)
  - Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
  - Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
  - Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)

- **Discovery:**
  - Obtains file and directory listings (T1083)
  - Lists running processes (T1057)
  - Obtains system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, and architecture (T1082)
  - Obtains the local IP address (T1016)
  - Obtains system time and time zone (T1124)

- **Collection:**
  - Compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002)
  - Collects files from the computer (T1005)
  - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025)

- **Command and Control:**
  - Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
  - Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
  - Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

- **Others:**
  - Backdoor named Vyveva, used by Lazarus to attack a freight logistics company in South Africa
  - Active since at least December 2018
  - Features file exfiltration, timestomping, and gathering victim information
  - Shares code similarities with older Lazarus samples (NukeSped malware family)
  - Components include an installer, loader, and main payload
  - Configuration is modifiable by C&C commands
  - Tor library used for C&C communication

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After compressing files with zlib for collection during the Collection tactic, is it likely that Vyveva will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more as part of the Exfiltration tactic?

- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Collection Tactic:**
  - Vyveva compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002)
  - Collects files from the computer (T1005)
  - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025)

- **Exfiltration Tactic:**
  - Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

- **Contextual Information:**
  - The report does not explicitly mention dividing files if they exceed a certain size.
  - However, it is common in malware to handle large files by dividing them to ensure successful exfiltration, especially when using network protocols that have size limitations.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report does not explicitly state that Vyveva divides files if they exceed 0x1000000 bytes.
  - However, the report mentions that Vyveva compresses files with zlib before exfiltration, which is a common technique to reduce file size.
  - Given the sophistication of the Lazarus group and the need to ensure successful exfiltration, it is plausible that Vyveva would implement a mechanism to handle large files, such as dividing them.
  - The lack of explicit mention in the report does not necessarily mean that this feature is absent, especially given the group's known capabilities.

- **Final Answer:**
  - Final Answer: A: Yes
