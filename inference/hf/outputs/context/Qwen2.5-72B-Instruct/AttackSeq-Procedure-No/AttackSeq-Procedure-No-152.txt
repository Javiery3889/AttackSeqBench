### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and in-memory malware, and removed disk-resident tools for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and removed tools after use.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit in memory to perform reconnaissance and gather output files.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and gather output files. This indicates that the threat actor was actively mapping the network and gathering information about the environment.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of SAML tokens or AD FS servers. However, given the sophisticated nature of the attack and the threat actor's focus on stealth and persistence, it is reasonable to consider whether they might use advanced techniques for lateral movement.
   - **Contextual Information:** The threat actor has shown a preference for in-memory operations and stealth, which aligns with the use of SAML tokens for lateral movement. SAML tokens can be used to authenticate and gain access to other systems without leaving significant traces on disk.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Stealth and In-Memory Operations:** TG1021's focus on in-memory operations and removing disk-resident tools suggests they are highly concerned with avoiding detection.
   - **Advanced Techniques:** The use of sophisticated tools and techniques for privilege escalation and defense evasion indicates that TG1021 is capable of employing advanced methods for lateral movement.
   - **SAML Tokens:** SAML tokens are a common target for advanced threat actors because they can be used to authenticate and move laterally without requiring additional credentials or leaving significant traces.

### Final Answer
Given the sophisticated nature of TG1021's operations and their focus on stealth and in-memory techniques, it is likely that they would abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token during the Lateral Movement phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
