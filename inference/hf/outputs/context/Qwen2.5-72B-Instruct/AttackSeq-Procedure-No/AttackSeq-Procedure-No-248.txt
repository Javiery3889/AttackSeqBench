### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros.
     - The macros executed an embedded JScript file.
   - **Execution:**
     - The VBA macro decodes and runs, writing JScript data to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and executing it.
     - A decoy XLS file is saved and loaded to maintain the appearance of legitimacy.
     - A VBScript file is created to delete the original file.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware modifies the '%regrun%' registry entry to ensure it starts automatically.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation techniques to hide the JScript and decoy XLS.
   - **Discovery:**
     - NanHaiShu gathers system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, and Proxy Server) and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The malware can receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu is likely to communicate between compromised hosts and their command-and-control servers via HTTP POST requests before using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Exfiltration:**
     - The report states that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTP POST requests for communication or data exfiltration.
   - **Common Malware Behavior:**
     - It is common for malware to use HTTP POST requests to communicate with C&C servers and exfiltrate data.
     - Given the sophistication of NanHaiShu and the detailed nature of the information gathered, it is reasonable to assume that HTTP POST requests are used for communication and data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly state the communication method used by NanHaiShu.
   - However, the report indicates that the malware gathers and uploads system information to the C&C server.
   - Given the common practice in malware to use HTTP POST for such communications, it is highly likely that NanHaiShu uses HTTP POST requests for both communication and data exfiltration.
