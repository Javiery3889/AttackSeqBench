### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with the delivery of an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various VBScripts and batch files were executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Persistence:** 'stopedge.bat' scheduled 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' was present.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scripts were heavily obfuscated, and 'stopedge.bat' managed file deletions to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** 'versioninfo.bat' collected information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** 'versioninfo.bat' prepared the collected information for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicated with the C2 server.
   - **Others:** The Konni APT Group is known for data exfiltration and espionage, primarily targeting South Korea.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Konni APT Group is likely to exfiltrate the collected data via a POST request before sending it through 'unactivate.vbs'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Mechanism:**
     - The report mentions that 'unactivate.vbs' is capable of exfiltration through a POST request.
     - 'versioninfo.bat' collects information and prepares it for exfiltration.
     - The sequence of events suggests that 'versioninfo.bat' collects the data, and 'unactivate.vbs' is responsible for exfiltrating it.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - 'versioninfo.bat' collects the data.
     - 'unactivate.vbs' is used to exfiltrate the data via a POST request.
     - The report does not explicitly state that the data is exfiltrated before being sent through 'unactivate.vbs', but it is logical to assume that 'unactivate.vbs' is the final step in the exfiltration process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that 'versioninfo.bat' collects information and prepares it for exfiltration.
   - 'unactivate.vbs' is specifically mentioned as being capable of exfiltration through a POST request.
   - The logical sequence of events is that 'versioninfo.bat' collects the data, and 'unactivate.vbs' exfiltrates it.
   - There is no indication in the report that the data is exfiltrated before being sent through 'unactivate.vbs'.
