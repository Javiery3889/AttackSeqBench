### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
- They sent 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails containing a Cozyduke payload to compromise high-profile government networks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
- It employs over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.

**Credential Access:**
- The Duke group uses Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell) and email extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials.

**Collection:**
- Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and securely delete the malware using a 'seppuku' function.

**Exfiltration:**
- Seaduke archives sensitive information and exfiltrates data via legitimate cloud services, and performs secure file deletion.

**Others:**
- The Duke group has been active since at least 2010, targeting governmental and diplomatic organizations.
- They have a range of malware tools, including Cozyduke, Miniduke, and Cosmicduke.
- They have sophisticated operators and continue to operate with advanced capabilities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing Seaduke to retrieve detailed bot/system information and securely delete itself using a 'seppuku' function, is it likely that Seaduke will calculate the command-and-control port by multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Seaduke is highly configurable and uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
- It employs over 200 compromised web servers for command and control.
- The malware is designed to be stealthy and sophisticated.

**Evaluation of the Question:**
- The question asks about a specific method for calculating the command-and-control (C2) port.
- The CTI report does not mention any specific method for calculating the C2 port.
- Given the sophistication and configurability of Seaduke, it is more likely that the C2 communication method is highly configurable and not based on a simple arithmetic operation like the one described in the question.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report emphasizes the sophistication and configurability of Seaduke.
- The method described in the question (multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet) is a relatively simple and predictable method.
- Given the advanced capabilities of the Duke group and the complexity of Seaduke, it is unlikely that they would use such a straightforward method for C2 communication.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
