### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The group used spear phishing and infections from other botnets.
- They also created their own large botnet using mass emailing.

**Execution:**
- Tools used: Mimikatz, MBR Eraser, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Cain & Abel, SSHD backdoor, Ammy Admin, Team Viewer, and Anunak malware.

**Persistence:**
- Infected ATM management infrastructure.
- Configured remote access to servers of interest, including firewall configuration changes.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used RDPdoor for remote access.
- Used MBR Eraser to remove traces and crack Windows computers and servers.
- Used legitimate programs like Ammy Admin and Team Viewer for remote access.

**Credential Access:**
- Compromised domain administrator passwords.
- Gained access to all active domain accounts, including email servers.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, escalating privileges, gathering credentials, and hopping onto other systems and networks.
- Used VNC scanning and password brute forcing.
- Added additional administrator accounts.
- Used RDP Wrapper to allow concurrent RDP sessions.

**Impact:**
- Changed denominations of issued banknotes in the ATM operating system registry.
- Used a modified debug program to issue money from the dispenser without opening the ATM housing and the vault door.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After connecting to backends using backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling for command and control activities, will the Anunak malware leverage Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement.
- The Anunak malware was used in conjunction with other tools for targeted attacks.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the attackers used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement.
- The Anunak malware was part of the core toolkit used by the attackers, and it is reasonable to infer that it would be used in conjunction with Metasploit for these activities.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly indicates that Metasploit was used for port scanning, system reconnaissance, and privilege escalation during lateral movement.
2. The Anunak malware was a core component of the attackers' toolkit.
3. Given the comprehensive use of Metasploit in the attack sequence, it is highly likely that the Anunak malware would leverage Metasploit for these activities.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
