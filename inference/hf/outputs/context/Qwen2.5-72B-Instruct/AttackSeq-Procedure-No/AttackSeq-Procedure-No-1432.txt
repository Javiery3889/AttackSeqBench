### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Smooth Operator malware was distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software. The infected software package was signed by 3CX and notarized by Apple. Malicious code was inserted into a dynamic library (dylib) within the 3CX software, which then downloads and executes a second-stage payload.
   - **Execution:** Smooth Operator malware executes as part of the 3CX software. It creates a new thread to run its functionality and uses a constructor function within the dylib to initiate without affecting the normal usage of the library.
   - **Persistence:** Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package, ensuring it runs every time the libffmpeg.dylib is loaded.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Smooth Operator employs several defense evasion techniques. The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process. It also deletes itself from disk immediately after execution. The malware writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate. Traffic to the C2 server is obfuscated with a custom data encoding algorithm.
   - **Discovery:** Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json. This data is included in beacons or exfiltration.
   - **Collection:** Smooth Operator stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration. It extracts the OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index, which are included in every beacon. The second-stage payload UpdateAgent parses and extracts domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation. It contains multiple C2 servers and randomly chooses a new server for each beacon. If one fails, it will try another.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Smooth Operator malware will exfiltrate its collected data from the infected machine to the C2 using the MIME protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication Protocol:** The CTI report clearly states that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
   - **Exfiltration Method:** The report mentions that the collected data is included in beacons or exfiltration, but it does not specify the protocol used for exfiltration. However, the use of HTTPS and a custom data encoding algorithm suggests that the exfiltration is likely to be over HTTPS as well.
   - **MIME Protocol:** MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is typically used for encoding and transmitting data over email and is not commonly used for exfiltration over HTTPS.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the communication with the C2 server is over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm.
   - There is no mention of MIME being used for exfiltration.
   - Given the focus on HTTPS and custom encoding, it is highly unlikely that MIME would be used for exfiltration.
