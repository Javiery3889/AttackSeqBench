### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - Babar ensures persistence by creating a registry key under `[HKU]\..\CurrentVersion\Run` named `MSSecurity` which executes the command line `regsvr32.exe /s /n /i "%APPDATA%\%DLLNAME%"` at system boot time.
     - This loads the Babar DLL and deploys the malware to various legitimate processes.
     - The `regsvr32.exe` process remains running even after Babar is set up.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Babar's dropper reduces forensic artifacts by executing a command line through spawning a `cmd.exe` process, which is instructed to wait for 1 second before deleting the dropper binary on disk.
     - The implant shows similar API name obfuscation methods as the Bunny malware and NBOT family, using an adapted version of SHA-1 to load dedicated APIs through a resolution function.
   - **Collection:**
     - Babar's implant is capable of logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, spying on installed softphones and instant messengers, and stealing data from office applications.
     - It uses global Windows hooks to actively steal data from arbitrary processes and has a keylogger module that uses the raw input model to grab keyboard events.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Babar communicates with C&C servers through a separate export called `FindCtxSectionStringW`, which is invoked through remote thread injection.
     - Two hardcoded C&C server addresses are included in its configuration data.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Babar compresses and encrypts data before dumping it to disk.
     - It uses 128-bit AES encryption with a specific key for reading and writing files.
     - The main instance of Babar handles stolen information received through named pipes from other instances or hooked processes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Babar is likely to load and execute DLLs in memory during runtime on a victim machine before establishing persistence by creating a registry key under `[HKU]\..\CurrentVersion\Run` to execute its DLL at system boot time.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report clearly states that Babar ensures persistence by creating a registry key under `[HKU]\..\CurrentVersion\Run` to execute its DLL at system boot time.
   - **Loading and Executing DLLs:**
     - The report mentions that Babar uses `regsvr32.exe` to load the DLL and deploy the malware to various legitimate processes.
     - This implies that the DLL is loaded and executed in memory during runtime.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to infer that the DLL must be loaded and executed in memory before it can be set up to run at system boot time.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Babar's dropper decrypts and loads the DLL using `regsvr32.exe`.
   - **Step 2:** The DLL is loaded and executed in memory.
   - **Step 3:** Babar sets up persistence by creating a registry key under `[HKU]\..\CurrentVersion\Run` to ensure the DLL runs at system boot time.
