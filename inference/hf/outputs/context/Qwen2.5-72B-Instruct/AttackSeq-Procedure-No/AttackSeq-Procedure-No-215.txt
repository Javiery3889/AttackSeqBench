### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **Others:** Attribution to Deep Panda and Winnti based on the use of Milestone backdoor and Fire Chili rootkit.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Deep Panda will use the Fire Chili rootkit packed with Themida only before ensuring persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - **Fire Chili Rootkit:** The report mentions the Fire Chili rootkit but does not specify when it is used in the attack sequence. It is only mentioned in the "Others" section, which provides context about the threat actor.
   - **Timing of Fire Chili Rootkit:** There is no indication in the report that the Fire Chili rootkit is used before ensuring persistence. The report focuses on the Milestone backdoor and its capabilities, including persistence, without mentioning the Fire Chili rootkit in the context of the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any information suggesting that the Fire Chili rootkit is used before the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence.
   - The Milestone backdoor is described in detail, including its persistence mechanism, but the Fire Chili rootkit is only mentioned in the context of attribution and past activities of the threat actors.
   - Given the lack of specific information about the timing of the Fire Chili rootkit in the attack sequence, it is unlikely that it is used only before ensuring persistence.
