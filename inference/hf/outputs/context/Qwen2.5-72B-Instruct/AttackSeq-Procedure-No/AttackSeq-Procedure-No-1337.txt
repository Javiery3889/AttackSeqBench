### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119).
- The exploit was embedded within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) that detailed a legal case between the Philippines and China.
- The exploit was strategically placed on the PCA website during the tribunal, targeting visitors interested in the case.

**Execution:**
- The malware payload identified as Rdws.exe, a dropper executable, deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique.
- It used the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll), which then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Others:**
- The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit.
- The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information.
- ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After connecting back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication, is it likely that the malware will then use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploit a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119) on the PCA website.
2. **Execution:** Deploy the malware payload (Rdws.exe) using a DLL sideloading technique.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Use the sideloading technique to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll) and a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).
4. **Command and Control:** Connect back to the exploit domain and a subdomain.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if, after connecting back to the exploit domain, the malware is likely to use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.
- From the CTI report, we know that the malware already used DLL sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion before connecting back to the exploit domain.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This choice aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI report. The malware used DLL sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion, and it connected back to the exploit domain as part of its command and control communication.
- **B: No** - This choice does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI report. The malware did use DLL sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the malware used DLL sideloading to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion before connecting back to the exploit domain.
- The question asks if the malware is likely to use sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion after connecting back to the exploit domain.
- Given that the malware has already used these techniques, it is reasonable to assume that it could use them again if needed for further evasion or to deploy additional components.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
