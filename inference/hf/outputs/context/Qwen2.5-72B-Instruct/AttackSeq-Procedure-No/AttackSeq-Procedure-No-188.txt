### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT targets NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia using phishing lures.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops its own remote access tools and uses publicly available tools like PlugX, Cobalt Strike, ORat, and RCSession.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession are used for execution.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The group elevates privileges and installs malware on many systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Steps are taken to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Credentials are collected from high-privilege accounts and NTDS.dit files.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands are used to understand the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Wmiexec and net commands are used to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** Custom batch scripts are used to collect files from specific locations.
   - **Exfiltration:** Tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike are used to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use the FTP protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after using scripts to collect files during the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts to collect files from specific locations.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report states that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for C2 communication. Instead, it focuses on the use of tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession, which are known for their C2 capabilities and are typically used over more secure and less detectable protocols like HTTPS or DNS.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - BRONZE PRESIDENT is known for using sophisticated tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession for both execution and exfiltration. These tools are designed to communicate over more secure and less detectable protocols to avoid detection.
   - The use of FTP for C2 communication is less common in advanced threat groups like BRONZE PRESIDENT because FTP is a less secure and more easily detectable protocol.
   - The report emphasizes the group's efforts to minimize detection, which aligns with the use of more secure and stealthy C2 methods.
