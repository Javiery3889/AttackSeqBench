### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and in-memory malware, and removed disk-resident tools for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools and techniques for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms and evaded EDRs.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement only after establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, which are tools typically used to map the network and identify potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request validation function, which allows the threat actor to perform various actions on the affected host.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention lateral movement, but it is a common next step after reconnaissance and establishing C2 to spread to other systems.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:** The use of SharpHound and PowerSploit indicates that TG1021 was actively mapping the network and identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
   - **Establishing C2:** The inline hook on the IIS request validation function is a critical step for maintaining control over the compromised server and performing further actions.
   - **Lateral Movement Timing:** It is logical that TG1021 would wait to establish a stable C2 channel before attempting to compromise additional IIS servers. This ensures that the threat actor has a reliable way to control and manage the compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The threat actor would likely compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement only after establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function. This ensures that the threat actor has a stable and reliable control mechanism before expanding the attack to other systems.
