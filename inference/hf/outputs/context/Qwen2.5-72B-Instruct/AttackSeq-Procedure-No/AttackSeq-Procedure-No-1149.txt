### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malware distribution campaign using Telegram channels.
     - Phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit.
     - Mailings with attachments containing malicious macros.
   - **Execution:**
     - Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers.
     - Raccoon stealer scans for valid crypto wallets and gains access to configuration files.
     - Vidar stealer collects data from browsers, bank card data, crypto wallet files, messages, and more.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram.
     - C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Raccoon stealer collected system and account information as well as crypto wallet data through the Execution phase only before making network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:**
     - The report clearly states that Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers.
     - It also scans for valid crypto wallets and gains access to configuration files.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - The report mentions that Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram.
     - The C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to infer that the stealer would collect the data (Execution phase) before communicating with the C&C servers (Command and Control phase) to receive encrypted addresses and ensure Defense Evasion.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Execution phase involves the collection of data.
   - The Command and Control phase involves communication with C&C servers.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the logical flow of the attack: data collection (Execution) followed by communication with C&C servers (Command and Control) to receive encrypted addresses and ensure Defense Evasion.
