### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access:**
  - SolarWinds was compromised in a sophisticated supply-chain attack.
  - The attackers deployed a custom backdoor, Sunburst, on the networks of over 18,000 customers.
  - This initial access allowed for further exploitation.
- **Others:**
  - HAFNIUM, a new APT actor, exploited four zero-days in Exchange Server for initial access.
  - A campaign active since mid-March targeted governmental entities in the Russian Federation using these Exchange zero-days.
  - The campaign utilized a previously unknown malware family named FourteenHi.
  - There were overlaps with HAFNIUM in terms of infrastructure and TTPs, as well as the use of ShadowPad malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access, is it likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using domain fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the CTI Report:**
  - The Sunburst backdoor was deployed through a supply-chain attack.
  - The report does not explicitly mention the use of domain fronting for C2 communication.
- **Contextual Information:**
  - Domain fronting is a technique used to disguise the destination of network traffic by using a legitimate domain to mask the actual C2 server.
  - While domain fronting is a known technique used by sophisticated APTs, the report does not provide specific evidence that Sunburst used this method.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access and Backdoor Deployment:**
   - The report clearly states that the attackers used a supply-chain attack to deploy the Sunburst backdoor.
2. **C2 Communication:**
   - The report does not provide specific details about the C2 communication methods used by Sunburst.
   - Domain fronting is a sophisticated technique, but the report does not mention it in the context of Sunburst.
3. **Plausibility:**
   - While domain fronting is a plausible technique for sophisticated APTs, the lack of specific evidence in the report makes it less likely that Sunburst used this method.
   - The report focuses on the initial access and the deployment of the backdoor, without delving into the specifics of C2 communication.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
