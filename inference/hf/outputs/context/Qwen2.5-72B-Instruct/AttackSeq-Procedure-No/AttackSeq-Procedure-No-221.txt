### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Outlaw hacking group used the Perl-based Shellbot to compromise an FTP server and a government site by exploiting a vulnerability on the Dovecot mail server.
   - **Execution:** The Shellbot is distributed by exploiting a command injection vulnerability on IoT devices and Linux servers, and it can also affect Windows environments and Android devices.
   - **Persistence:** Once installed, the Shellbot communicates persistently with the C&C servers via IRC. Restarting the infected machine does not revert the changes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Shellbot assigns hardcoded process names to hide from system admins, security monitoring, and researchers. It uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open and avoid disconnection.
   - **Discovery:** The Shellbot gathers information about the infected host, such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Shellbot is likely to gather information about the infected host after establishing C&C communication via an IRC channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the Shellbot gathers information about the infected host, including the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed.
   - This information gathering is part of the **Discovery** phase of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - The report also mentions that the Shellbot communicates persistently with the C&C servers via IRC, which is part of the **Command and Control** phase.
   - The sequence of events in the report suggests that after establishing C&C communication, the Shellbot proceeds to gather information about the infected host.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Shellbot establishes C&C communication via an IRC channel.
   - Once the C&C communication is established, the Shellbot moves to the **Discovery** phase to gather information about the infected host.
   - The information gathered includes the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools are installed.
