### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.
   - **Discovery:** The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 would engage in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views before performing execution using process hollowing to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that the initial access was via a spear-phishing email with a trojanized installation executable.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the malware performed discovery activities by collecting system information and network views.
   - **Execution:** The report mentions that the malware used process hollowing to execute the second-stage payload and evade detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is as follows:
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email with trojanized installation executable.
     2. **Execution:** Malware TDrop2 executes a legitimate executable and uses process hollowing to inject malicious code.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** Malware uses process hollowing and obfuscation techniques.
     4. **Discovery:** Malware collects system information and network views.
     5. **Command and Control:** Malware communicates with C2 servers.
   - The question asks if it is likely that discovery activities (gathering system information and network views) would occur before the execution using process hollowing.
   - Based on the report, the discovery activities are listed after the execution and defense evasion steps. However, it is common for malware to perform discovery activities to understand the environment before fully executing its payload to ensure it can operate effectively and avoid detection.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the order of discovery and execution, it is plausible that discovery activities could occur before or after the initial execution and defense evasion steps. However, the question asks if it is likely, and given the nature of malware operations, it is reasonable to assume that discovery activities often occur early in the attack lifecycle to gather necessary information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
