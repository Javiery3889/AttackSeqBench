### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882, leading to silent code execution (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043, T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor will proceed to collect data from the local system before employing defense evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation (T1204):** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882, leading to silent code execution.
   - **Data Collection:** The report does not explicitly state that data collection occurred immediately after the exploitation. However, the dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens, which is a form of data collection (T1003, T1081, T1214).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing) for defense evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after the initial exploitation (T1204), the threat actor likely proceeded to collect data (T1003, T1081, T1214) before employing defense evasion techniques (T1107, T1158, T1045).
   - The logical flow of the attack is:
     1. Initial Access (T1193)
     2. Execution (T1204)
     3. Data Collection (T1003, T1081, T1214)
     4. Defense Evasion (T1107, T1158, T1045)
     5. Command and Control (T1043, T1071)
     6. Exfiltration (T1002)
