### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- An email with a PDF attachment (actually an executable) was sent to Susan, a secretary at Black Gold.
- The PDF passed through all security filters and initiated the attack when opened.

**Execution:**
- The executable created a folder and extracted files.
- 'stat.vbs' executed 'deca.bat', which opened a blank PDF and ran 'dcp.exe' to decrypt files and extract 'bare.zip'.
- 'sai.vbs' was then executed.

**Persistence:**
- Modified the Windows registry to ensure 'aagi.bat' ran at system start.
- Used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection.
- Configured an application to run another batch file every hour to maintain operations.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.
- Remained undetected for almost six months.

**Collection:**
- Collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials from various firms in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.

**Command and Control:**
- Used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server.
- 'iei.bat' was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of data.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013.

**Others:**
- The attack, dubbed 'Phantom Menace', targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.
- Linked to a scam involving fake oil deals.
- Attackers based in Nigeria, with connections to Ikeja.
- Victims were unwilling to report the crime.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity, is it likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use ARP cache poisoning to collect credentials before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Persistence:**
- The attackers configured applications to run batch files every hour to maintain operations and collect credentials.

**Collection:**
- Credentials were collected recurrently every hour using legitimate applications.

**Command and Control:**
- Credentials were uploaded to an external FTP server using an FTP command.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server.

**ARP Cache Poisoning:**
- ARP cache poisoning is a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic by altering the ARP table on a network device. It is typically used to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker can intercept and modify data packets.

**Contextual Analysis:**
- The CTI report does not mention any use of ARP cache poisoning.
- The attack primarily used legitimate tools and scripts to collect and exfiltrate credentials.
- The focus was on maintaining persistence and evading detection, rather than intercepting network traffic.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The attack's primary methods involved using legitimate applications and scripts to collect and exfiltrate credentials.
- The report does not indicate any use of network-level attacks like ARP cache poisoning.
- The attackers focused on maintaining persistence and evading detection, which aligns with the use of legitimate tools and scripts.
- ARP cache poisoning would add complexity and risk of detection, which the attackers seemed to avoid.

**Final Answer:**
- B: No
