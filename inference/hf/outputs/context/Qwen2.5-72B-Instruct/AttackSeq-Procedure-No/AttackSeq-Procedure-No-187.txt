### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT targets NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia using phishing lures.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops its own remote access tools and uses publicly available tools like PlugX, Cobalt Strike, ORat, and RCSession.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files are used for initial access.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession are used for execution.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The group elevates privileges and installs malware on many systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Steps are taken to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Credentials are collected from high-privilege accounts and NTDS.dit files.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands are used to understand the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Wmiexec and net commands are used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Custom batch scripts are used to collect files from specific locations.
   - **Exfiltration:** Tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike are used to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use ORat with a raw socket protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication only before the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts to collect files from specific locations.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report mentions that ORat is one of the tools used by the group, but it does not specify the use of raw socket protocol for C2 communication.
   - **Timing of C2 Communication:** The report does not indicate that ORat is used exclusively before the Collection phase. Instead, it suggests that ORat is part of the overall toolkit used throughout the attack lifecycle.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide specific information about the use of ORat with a raw socket protocol for C2 communication only before the Collection phase.
   - The group's use of multiple tools and techniques suggests a flexible and adaptive approach to maintaining C2 communication throughout the attack lifecycle.
   - Given the lack of specific evidence in the report, it is unlikely that ORat is used exclusively with a raw socket protocol for C2 communication only before the Collection phase.
