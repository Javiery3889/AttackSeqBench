### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using a PowerShell one-liner and relies on scheduled tasks for executing batch files.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and moves laterally to systems with domain admins logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing or password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
   - **Collection:** The adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online, file shares, and email.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary will divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase Details:**
     - The report mentions that the adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online.
     - The report does not explicitly state whether the adversary divides files based on size before exfiltration.
   - **General TTPs:**
     - The adversary uses Cobalt Strike, which is a sophisticated tool that can handle large data exfiltration.
     - The report mentions that the adversary compresses and encrypts data before exfiltration.
     - The adversary is known to use various methods to avoid detection, including timestomping and log clearing.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **File Size Consideration:**
     - 16 MB is a relatively large file size, and dividing such files can help in avoiding detection and ensuring successful exfiltration.
     - Cobalt Strike, being a sophisticated tool, likely has built-in mechanisms to handle large files, including dividing them if necessary.
   - **Exfiltration Methods:**
     - The report mentions that the adversary uses C2 protocols like DNS and HTTPS, which may have limitations on the size of data that can be transmitted in a single request.
     - Dividing files can help in managing these limitations and ensuring that the data is exfiltrated without issues.
   - **Operational Security:**
     - The adversary is known to take steps to avoid detection, and dividing large files can be part of these steps to reduce the risk of being caught.

### Final Answer
Given the sophisticated nature of the adversary and the tools they use, it is likely that they would divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes or more before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
