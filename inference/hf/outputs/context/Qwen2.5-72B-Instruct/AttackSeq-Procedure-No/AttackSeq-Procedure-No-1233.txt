### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 scans for new targets, particularly in Ukraine and Spain.
     - Uses a python script, a database, scan bots, and a Django application.
     - Bots are geographically distributed.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits.
     - First stage: dropper (runrun.exe) contacts C&C and downloads second stage.
   - **Execution:**
     - Second stage: dropper (winloat.exe) writes key components and tools.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Changes file timestamps to hide files.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Uses CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe).
   - **Discovery:**
     - Scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems using bots.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates via HTTP on port 443 or 80, encrypted with 3DES and RSA.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Steals emails and files, uploads to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots only after deploying additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report states that APT28 performs discovery by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems using geographically distributed bots.
     - This activity is part of the initial reconnaissance phase and is not tied to the exfiltration phase.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions that APT28 exfiltrates data using modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The discovery phase (scanning IP ranges) is described as an early activity, part of the reconnaissance and initial access phases.
     - The exfiltration phase (uploading stolen data) is described as a later activity, after the attacker has gained access and control of the system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase (scanning IP ranges) is a critical early step in the attack lifecycle, used to identify potential targets.
   - The exfiltration phase (uploading stolen data) is a later step, occurring after the attacker has already gained access and control of the system.
   - It is unlikely that APT28 would perform discovery only after deploying additional modules for exfiltration, as discovery is a foundational step that precedes the exfiltration phase.
