### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- WinDealer executes by reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData`.
- It loads a DLL module into memory.
- The malware steals information from the victim's PC, including network configuration and SNS application details.
- Stolen data is saved with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Configuration files are encoded using XOR with the key "b6a7%7486".
- Communication with C2 servers is encrypted using AES and RSA.
- Stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.

**Discovery:**
- The malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
- It also collects data from SNS applications.
- Stolen data is processed and staged in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypted with AES before sending to a C2 server.

**Collection:**
- The malware collects data from various sources, including USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin, and SNS application folders.
- Collected data is processed into ".a" files and categorized into different directories based on the data type.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen data is exfiltrated to a C2 server after processing and encrypting.
- Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.

**Others:**
- The LuoYu Attack Group targets Korean and Japanese organizations.
- WinDealer operates on various platforms.
- The malware uses a hardcoded RSA1024bit public key for encryption.
- The DLL module, "MozillaDll.dll", has export functions for stealing data, setting configuration, and initiating commands.
- The malware monitors and processes data from USB memory and SNS application folders.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Is it likely that WinDealer will communicate with C2 servers using non-standard ports such as UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556 before it steals information from SNS applications and encrypts this data using AES?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Yes
B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Communication with C2 Servers:**
  - The report mentions that WinDealer communicates with C2 servers using encrypted channels.
  - It specifically states that the communication involves encrypting an AES key with RSA and sending it to the C2 server.
  - There is no mention of specific ports used for communication.

- **Data Collection and Encryption:**
  - The malware collects data from SNS applications and other sources.
  - Stolen data is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not specify the ports used for communication with C2 servers.
- The focus is on the encryption methods and the types of data collected.
- Given the lack of information about specific ports, it is not possible to definitively state that WinDealer uses non-standard ports such as UDP 6999 or TCP 55556.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not provide any information about the specific ports used for communication with C2 servers.
- The report focuses on the encryption methods and the types of data collected and exfiltrated.
- Without explicit information about the ports, it is not reasonable to assume that WinDealer uses non-standard ports such as UDP 6999 or TCP 55556.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
