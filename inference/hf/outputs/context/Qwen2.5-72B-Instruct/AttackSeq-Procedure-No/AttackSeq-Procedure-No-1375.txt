### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Word document using the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Execution:**
     - The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt, which then invokes PowerShell.
     - PowerShell runs two commands:
       1. The first command downloads a string from a URL and executes it as an encoded command.
       2. The second command is Base64 encoded and is found in the version of `config.txt` received from the remote server. It downloads a file from a URL and creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after creating a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence, the document is likely to leverage the DDE technique via PowerShell to achieve execution by downloading and running encoded commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs in the CTI Report:**
     1. **Initial Access:** Malicious document uses DDE to execute arbitrary code.
     2. **Execution:** PowerShell is invoked to run commands that download and execute encoded commands.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** DDE is used to bypass network defenses.
     4. **Persistence:** A batch file and a registry entry are created to ensure persistence.
     5. **Command and Control:** The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware.
   - **Sequence of TTPs in the Question:**
     - The question focuses on the persistence step and asks if the document is likely to use DDE and PowerShell to download and run encoded commands after ensuring persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell, which then runs commands to download and execute encoded commands. This happens before the creation of the batch file and registry entry for persistence.
   - The question asks if the document is likely to use DDE and PowerShell to download and run encoded commands **after** ensuring persistence.
   - Based on the sequence in the CTI report, the DDE and PowerShell execution happens before the persistence step, not after.

### Final Answer
