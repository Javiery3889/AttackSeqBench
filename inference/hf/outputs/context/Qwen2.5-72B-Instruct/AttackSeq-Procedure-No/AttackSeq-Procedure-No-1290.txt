### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Mustang Panda used spearphishing with malicious '.lnk' files.
- These files contained embedded HTA scripts.
- Once executed, the scripts dropped and opened decoy documents while running malicious payloads in the background.

**Execution:**
- The '.lnk' files contained embedded HTA files with VBscript or PowerShell scripts.
- These scripts executed operations such as dropping Cobalt Strike Stagers and opening decoy documents.
- PlugX malware was also delivered as a primary payload.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Mustang Panda used the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to deceive users.
- They used PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads, which align with previous findings of activity attributed to Mustang Panda by CrowdStrike.

**Others:**
- The campaign targeted minority groups, public and private sector organizations.
- The campaign dates back to at least November 2018 and possibly as far back as October 2017.
- Targets include individuals interested in United Nations' Security Council Committee resolutions, Mongolian-based MIAT Airlines, non-profit China Center, and countries such as Germany, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Vietnam.
- The campaign's objectives align with China's strategic interests, including its 13th Five-Year Plan and the Belt and Road Initiative.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing the double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to evade defenses within their spearphishing campaign, is Mustang Panda likely to use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Mustang Panda uses sophisticated techniques for initial access and execution.
- They employ defense evasion techniques such as the double extension trick.
- They use Cobalt Strike and PlugX malware, which are known for their advanced capabilities.

**Relevance to the Question:**
- The question asks about the likelihood of using a reverse SOCKS proxy module for communication.
- Cobalt Strike, one of the payloads used by Mustang Panda, is known for its extensive capabilities, including the ability to set up reverse SOCKS proxies.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - Cobalt Strike is a versatile tool that can be configured to use reverse SOCKS proxies to maintain communication with the command and control (C2) server.
  - Given Mustang Panda's use of advanced malware and their strategic objectives, it is plausible that they would use such a sophisticated communication method.
- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Mustang Panda would not use a reverse SOCKS proxy, which seems less likely given their use of advanced tools and techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- Mustang Panda uses sophisticated tools like Cobalt Strike and PlugX.
- Cobalt Strike is known for its ability to set up reverse SOCKS proxies.
- The use of advanced malware and techniques aligns with the strategic objectives of the campaign.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that Mustang Panda would use a reverse SOCKS proxy module as part of their communication strategy.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
