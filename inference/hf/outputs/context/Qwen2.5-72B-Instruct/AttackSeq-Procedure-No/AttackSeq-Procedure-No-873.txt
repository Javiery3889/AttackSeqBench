### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with a wave of highly targeted attacks against multiple companies.
- The attackers exploited a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day exploits.
- The exploit used for remote code execution (RCE) in Chrome was not retrieved, but an elevation of privilege (EoP) exploit was analyzed.
- The EoP exploit was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- The attackers utilized an elevation of privilege exploit fine-tuned against the latest builds of Windows 10.
- Two distinct vulnerabilities were exploited: CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
- CVE-2021-31955 is an information disclosure vulnerability in ntoskrnl.exe related to the SuperFetch feature.
- CVE-2021-31956 is a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs.sys.
- The exploit used CVE-2021-31955 to obtain kernel addresses and CVE-2021-31956 along with Windows Notification Facility (WNF) to create arbitrary memory read and write primitives.
- The exploit also used a "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky products detected the attacks using the Behavioral Detection Engine and the Exploit Prevention component.
- The threat actor behind these attacks is referred to as PuzzleMaker.
- The malware modules are detected with the verdicts PDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic, PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic, and UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.
- The hashes for the executables involved in the attack are provided for %SYSTEM%\WmiPrvMon.exe and %SYSTEM%\wmimon.dll.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After downloading and executing a malware Dropper module to further the attack, will the Stager module notify of successful exploitation only after exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - Gain initial access through the Chrome browser.
2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Use CVE-2021-31955 to obtain kernel addresses.
   - Use CVE-2021-31956 and WNF to create arbitrary memory read and write primitives.
   - Use the "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after the initial access and privilege escalation steps.
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention a Stager module or its notification mechanism.
- However, the report does describe the sequence of initial access and privilege escalation in detail.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This answer implies that the Stager module will only notify of successful exploitation after the initial access and privilege escalation steps.
  - The CTI report does not provide information about a Stager module or its notification mechanism, but it does describe the sequence of initial access and privilege escalation.
- **B: No**
  - This answer implies that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation at some other point, not necessarily after the initial access and privilege escalation steps.
  - Given the lack of information about the Stager module in the CTI report, this answer is less likely to be correct.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly outlines the sequence of initial access and privilege escalation.
- The question asks if the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation only after these steps.
- While the report does not mention a Stager module, the logical sequence of events suggests that the Stager module would likely notify of successful exploitation after the initial access and privilege escalation steps have been completed.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
