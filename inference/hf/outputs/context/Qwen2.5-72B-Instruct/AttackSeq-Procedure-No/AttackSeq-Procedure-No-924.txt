### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
   - **Execution:** The threat actors uploaded a variety of tools, including legitimate applications and post-exploitation tools like Mimikatz, and custom backdoors such as HyperBro.
   - **Persistence:** The actors installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence, including Antak, stylecs.aspx, stylecss.aspx, and test.aspx.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Emissary Panda used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and used the China Chopper webshell to maintain access and evade defenses.
   - **Credential Access:** The actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials, which were then used to pivot to additional systems within the network.
   - **Discovery:** The threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance, identifying vulnerable systems and gathering information to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Command and Control:** The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control, configured to communicate with a C2 server over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda sent Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials before scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems through tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Webshells:** The report clearly states that Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 and installed webshells on SharePoint servers.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that the actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials, which were then used to pivot to additional systems.
   - **Discovery and Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that the threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance and moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).

   However, the report does not mention any activity related to sending Telegram messages impersonating IT personnel to harvest credentials. The credential access was primarily achieved through the use of Mimikatz and other tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access and webshell installation are consistent with the report.
   - The use of Mimikatz for credential dumping is consistent with the report.
   - The network reconnaissance and lateral movement using CVE-2017-0144 are consistent with the report.
   - The report does not mention any social engineering tactics such as sending Telegram messages to impersonate IT personnel.
