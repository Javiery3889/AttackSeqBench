### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India, often using LNK files and decoy documents.
   - **Resource Development:** Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains, focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach MFA app.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, registry keys, and VBScripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes to target military personnel, honeytraps, and cloned websites.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts, verifies requests from specific geographies.
   - **Exfiltration:** Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach MFA app, and uses njRAT malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain involving HTAs and loader DLLs to deliver payloads.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** The report emphasizes that SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach MFA app, and they use njRAT malware for this purpose.
   - **API Hooking and Mouse Movements:** The report does not mention any specific techniques related to capturing mouse movements or performing API hooking. The focus is on using RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** SideCopy gains initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain.
   - **Execution and Persistence:** They deploy RATs and plugins for various malicious activities, including credential stealing.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** The primary focus is on using njRAT malware to harvest credentials, particularly from the Kavach MFA app.
   - **API Hooking and Mouse Movements:** There is no mention of these specific techniques in the report. The report focuses on more direct methods of credential harvesting and persistence.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI report, SideCopy is not likely to capture mouse movements or perform API hooking before deploying njRAT malware for credential harvesting. The report emphasizes more direct methods of credential harvesting and persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
