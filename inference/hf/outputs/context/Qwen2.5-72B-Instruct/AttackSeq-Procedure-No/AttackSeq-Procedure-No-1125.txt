### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with a spear-phishing attack targeting the US Government.
- The attack exploited an Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) using a link to a Flash exploit hosted on domains rpt.perrydale[.]com and report.perrydale[.]com.
- The Flash exploit was found at the URLs: rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf and report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf.
- The exploit retrieved a secondary payload, 'b.gif', from the same domains.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malicious Flash file 'show.swf' attempted to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode to install a payload.
- The payload was embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'.
- However, the payload was not weaponized as it lacked an encrypted payload, possibly due to UPS's tactic of serving payloads only within limited time windows and to specific victim profiles.

**Others:**
- The attack shares similarities with a previous targeted attack attributed to the APT group known as UPS or APT3.
- The ActionScript classes and log messages in the malicious Flash files indicate attribution to UPS.
- The payload extraction and decryption technique from an animated GIF image was also used in the CVE-2015-3113 attacks.
- The shellcodes for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113 were found to be 99% similar.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the spear-phishing attack exploits the Adobe Flash vulnerability through the links rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf and report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf for initial access, is it likely that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' will attempt to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif' before executing shellcode using embedded ActionScript classes?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Spear-phishing attack with a link to a Flash exploit.
   - The Flash exploit is hosted on rpt.perrydale[.]com and report.perrydale[.]com.
   - The exploit is found at the URLs: rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/show.swf and report.perrydale[.]com/ema/show.swf.
   - The exploit retrieves a secondary payload, 'b.gif', from the same domains.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - The Flash file 'show.swf' attempts to exploit the vulnerability and execute shellcode.
   - The payload is embedded in an animated GIF image, 'b.gif'.
   - The payload was not weaponized due to UPS's tactic of serving payloads only within limited time windows and to specific victim profiles.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The Flash exploit 'show.swf' does attempt to evade defenses by embedding the payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.
  - The report states that the payload is embedded in 'b.gif' and the Flash file uses embedded ActionScript classes to execute shellcode.
  - This aligns with the described sequence of events in the CTI report.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the Flash exploit does not attempt to evade defenses with a payload embedded in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.
  - However, the report clearly states that the payload is embedded in 'b.gif' and the Flash file uses embedded ActionScript classes to execute shellcode.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that the Flash exploit 'show.swf' attempts to evade defenses by embedding the payload in an animated GIF image 'b.gif'.
- The report also mentions that the Flash file uses embedded ActionScript classes to execute shellcode.
- The sequence of events described in the report matches the sequence of TTPs mentioned in the question.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
