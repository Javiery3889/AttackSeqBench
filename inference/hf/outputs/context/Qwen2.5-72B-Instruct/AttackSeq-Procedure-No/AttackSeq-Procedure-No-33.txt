### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files, and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting newly inserted devices, file listings, and enumerating running processes.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, using FTP and HTTP, and copying data to removable drives if a special file is present.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to collect data by copying files from removable media only after conducting discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - Machete conducts discovery by listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting newly inserted devices, producing file listings, and enumerating running processes.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Machete exfiltrates data by encrypting and sending it over FTP and HTTP.
     - It also copies data to removable drives if a special file is present on the drive.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that Machete performs discovery activities, including listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes.
   - After discovery, Machete can exfiltrate data by copying it to removable drives if a special file is present.
   - The report does not explicitly state that copying data from removable media is only done after listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes. However, the discovery activities are a prerequisite for identifying and accessing removable media.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the sequence, it is logical to assume that discovery activities (listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes) are performed before copying data from removable media. This is because discovery helps identify the presence and contents of removable media.

### Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide a strict sequence that copying data from removable media is only done after listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Machete does not necessarily follow this specific sequence.
