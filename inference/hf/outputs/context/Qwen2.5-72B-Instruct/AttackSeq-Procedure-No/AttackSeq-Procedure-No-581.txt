### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN8 uses BADHATCH v2.14, a backdoor that downloads and executes a script from a domain mapped by sslip.io.
     - The script uses base64 representations of shellcode and a .NET binary to execute the shellcode in memory.
   - **Execution:**
     - BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
     - POWERSHELL mode uses IEX to execute commands from a pipe.
     - CMD mode uses cmd.exe to execute various commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - WMI event subscription mechanism is used to ensure persistence.
     - A PowerShell script sets up an event consumer named PerfData.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is indicated by the execution of sh-tmp.ps1, which likely escalates privileges to the SYSTEM user.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Various techniques are used, including TLS encryption and masquerading communication as legitimate HTTP requests.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Credential dumping is suggested by the execution of mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
     - Telemetry data indicates that the PowerShell process read the memory of lsass.exe.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement to the Domain Controller is achieved using wmic.exe to create a process on the DC and execute the BADHATCH deployment script.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script speculated to be related to Mimikatz and read the memory of lsass.exe after conducting system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery using commands like nltest.exe and ping.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Fingerprinting and Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of nltest.exe and ping.exe for system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery. However, these are common tools used in the reconnaissance phase to gather information about the network and domain structure.
   - **Credential Dumping:**
     - The report clearly states that credential dumping is suggested by the execution of mimi.ps1, which is speculated to be related to Mimikatz.
     - Telemetry data indicates that the PowerShell process read the memory of lsass.exe, which is a common target for credential dumping.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides strong evidence that the attackers are likely to perform credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz.
   - The use of mimi.ps1 and the reading of lsass.exe memory are explicitly mentioned, indicating that credential dumping is a part of the attack sequence.
   - While the report does not detail the exact sequence of system fingerprinting and domain trust discovery, it is a logical step in the attack lifecycle before attempting credential dumping to gain further access and move laterally within the network.
