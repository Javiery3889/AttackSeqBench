### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Patchwork, an Indian APT group, conducted spear phishing campaigns in March and April 2018.
- They targeted US-based think tanks.
- Used unique tracking links to identify recipients who opened the emails.

**Initial Access:**
- Spear phishing campaigns used domains and themes mimicking well-known think tank organizations.
- Malicious RTF documents were used to exploit CVE-2017-8750.
- The exploit code was publicly available on Github.
- If successful, the exploit would drop and execute QuasarRAT.

**Persistence:**
- The initial dropper (qrat.exe) creates a directory and drops the final QuasarRAT binary (microsoft_network.exe).
- A scheduled task is created to ensure persistence.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware beacons to the C2 domain tautiaos.com every 5 minutes for 60 days.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After recipients are presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report, is it likely that they will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery only after getting infected with QuasarRAT?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750.
- If the exploit is successful, QuasarRAT is dropped and executed.
- The sequence of events is: spear phishing email -> RTF document -> CVE-2017-8750 exploit -> QuasarRAT delivery.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that recipients receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 only after they are already infected with QuasarRAT. This does not align with the CTI report, which states that the initial infection occurs through the spear phishing emails.
- **B: No** - This aligns with the CTI report, which indicates that the initial infection occurs through the spear phishing emails containing the RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents that exploit CVE-2017-8750.
- The sequence of events is: spear phishing email -> RTF document -> CVE-2017-8750 exploit -> QuasarRAT delivery.
- Therefore, it is not likely that recipients will receive spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 only after getting infected with QuasarRAT.

**Final Answer: B: No**
