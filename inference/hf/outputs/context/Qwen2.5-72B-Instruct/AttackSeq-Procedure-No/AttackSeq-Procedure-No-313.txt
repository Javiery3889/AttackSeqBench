### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Dragonfly campaign conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
   - **Resource Development:** They created or gained user accounts and used remote-desktop protocol to operate stealthily.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear-phishing emails to download Trojan software.
   - **Execution:** They used backdoor malware embedded within trusted software.
   - **Persistence:** They created or gained user accounts and used remote-desktop protocol.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They incorporated code from TeamViewer into their backdoor and used self-deleting code.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used remote-desktop protocol to move laterally.
   - **Impact:** They have the ability to take offensive disruptive and destructive action.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence during the defense evasion tactic, the Dragonfly group used the remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems before focusing on Windows systems to gather system information as part of the discovery tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report states that the Dragonfly attackers used self-deleting code to remove traces of their presence.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report also states that they used remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention the discovery tactic, but it is a logical next step after gaining access and moving laterally to gather system information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report suggests that after defense evasion (using self-deleting code), the attackers would likely move laterally using remote-desktop protocol.
   - The discovery of system information is a common next step after gaining access and moving laterally, as it helps the attackers understand the network and identify valuable targets.
   - The report does not explicitly state the discovery tactic, but it is a logical and common step in the attack lifecycle.
