### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The attackers acquired domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org) and developed capabilities including malware (Graphite malware) and tools (Empire).
     - These resources were used to support the operation, with domains purchased to serve as command and control servers, and malicious components built to conduct the attack.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The adversaries initiated the attack by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx) to gain access to victim systems.
     - They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The adversaries established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
     - They also created a local account to maintain access to victim systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The adversaries used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel (use of different Empire stagers) and used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.
     - They also employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired domains to be used as command and control servers and developed malicious components including the Graphite malware only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components (Graphite malware) and tools (Empire) as part of their resource development phase.
     - This phase is described as occurring before the initial access.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment and exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The use of reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) is mentioned in the defense evasion phase, which occurs after initial access.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The command and control phase involves the use of Empire stagers and existing web services, which also occurs after initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The resource development phase, which includes acquiring domains and developing malicious components, is described as a preparatory step before the initial access.
   - The use of PowerShell to execute the Empire stager is part of the defense evasion phase, which occurs after the initial access.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers acquired domains and developed malicious components only after using PowerShell to execute the Empire stager.
