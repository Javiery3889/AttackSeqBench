### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd service and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd binary at /system/bin/netd and ensuring it is executed by init.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware scrapes files containing credentials and uses tcpdump to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** The malware enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware provides SCP functionality, a Tor hidden service, and a local Socks connection for db, which provides SSH server and client capabilities.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Infamous Chisel will automatically exfiltrate files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections after replacing the legitimate netd service.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - This aligns perfectly with the question's description of the exfiltration method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Execution and Persistence:** The malware replaces the legitimate netd service and ensures it is executed by init, which is a critical step for its persistence and privilege escalation.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report clearly states that the netd component of Infamous Chisel automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses a Tor hidden service and SSH connections for command and control, which supports the exfiltration process.
