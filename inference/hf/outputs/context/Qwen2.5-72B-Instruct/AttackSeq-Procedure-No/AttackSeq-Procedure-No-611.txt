### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     - Similar domain names are used to mimic legitimate entities.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Malicious domain falcancoin.io created and updated.
     - Bankshot implant is a remote access tool with destructive capabilities.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     - Document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Implant designed to evade detection and persist.
     - Contains functionality to wipe files and content.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files.
     - Communicate with control servers, some of which are Chinese-language online gambling sites.
   - **Others:**
     - High success rate against unpatched Flash versions.
     - Documents evaded static defenses and remained undetected.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files before being executed via the exploitation in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - **Exploitation:**
     - The exploit allows the execution of arbitrary code, which in this case is the Bankshot implant.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question is:
       1. Initial access via spear phishing email.
       2. Exploitation of the Flash vulnerability in the Word document.
       3. Execution of the Bankshot implant.
       4. Communication with control servers disguised as ZIP files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is gained through a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit.
   - The exploit allows the execution of the Bankshot implant.
   - The Bankshot implant, once executed, communicates with control servers disguised as ZIP files.
   - The sequence in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.
