### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained access via SSH using a local account.
     - Used port forwarding to establish RDP sessions.
     - Used VPNs to gain access and persist.
     - Exported saved passwords from Chrome browsers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used credential hopping.
     - Leveraged Delegated Administrator rights.
     - Configured TrailBlazer and GoldMax malware for persistence.
     - Added credentials to O365 Service Principals.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.
     - Renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate binaries.
     - Renamed systems to match victim's naming convention.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Stole web session cookies.
     - Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
     - Used compromised service principals to make changes to Office 365.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify Active Directory information.
     - Regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe.
     - Probed external services.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment only after accessing data from Information Repositories.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The report states that the threat actor used AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report mentions that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment.
   - **Access to Information Repositories:**
     - The report does not specify a sequence where the threat actor accessed data from Information Repositories before using RDP for lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP for lateral movement, but it does not specify that this activity was only performed after accessing data from Information Repositories.
   - The sequence of activities described in the report does not suggest a strict order where accessing data from Information Repositories must precede lateral movement using RDP.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
