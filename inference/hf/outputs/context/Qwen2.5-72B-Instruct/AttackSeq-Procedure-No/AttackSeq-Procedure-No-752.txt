### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
- Targets were defense and government-related organizations.

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
- The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
- The downloader retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.

**Execution:**
- The shellcode executed by the macro in winword.exe acted as a downloader.
- It resolved Libraries and APIs, downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document, and executed both payloads.

**Persistence:**
- The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

**Command and Control:**
- The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- Data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

**Exfiltration:**
- Data was exfiltrated to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

**Others:**
- The implant shares similarities with Lazarus Group attacks but may include false flags.
- The campaign targeted various sectors globally, predominantly in the United States.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After ensuring persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process, is it likely that the Rising Sun implant will collect the MAC address of an infected host as part of its discovery activities before communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Rising Sun implant ensures persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
- It communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
- Data is encrypted and obfuscated before exfiltration.

**Discovery Activities:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the collection of the MAC address as part of the discovery activities.
- However, it is common for advanced malware to collect various system information, including the MAC address, to identify the infected host and provide context to the attackers.

**Command and Control:**
- The implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests, which suggests that it sends data to the server.
- The data sent is encrypted and obfuscated, indicating that it could include various types of system information.

**Contextual Information:**
- The implant has 14 backdoor capabilities, including executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes.
- Collecting the MAC address is a typical activity for such backdoors to identify the infected host.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly state that the Rising Sun implant collects the MAC address.
- However, given the advanced nature of the implant and its capabilities, it is highly likely that it would collect the MAC address as part of its discovery activities.
- The implant's communication with control servers using HTTP POST requests and the encryption of data suggest that it sends detailed information about the infected host.
- The 14 backdoor capabilities of the implant, which include gathering various system information, further support the likelihood of MAC address collection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
