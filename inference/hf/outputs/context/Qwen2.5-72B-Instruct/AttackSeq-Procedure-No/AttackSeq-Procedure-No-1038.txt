### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Initial Access**: The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
- **Execution**: APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
- **Defense Evasion**: APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
- **Lateral Movement**: APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
- **Collection**: APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
- **Command and Control**: The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
- **Exfiltration**: The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that APT10 will gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services servers to access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller after escalating privileges using DLL sideloading techniques and evading defenses by loading a malicious DLL to inject Trochilus payloads into memory.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion**: The report confirms that APT10 used DLL sideloading to escalate privileges and evade defenses by loading a malicious DLL to inject Trochilus payloads into memory.
- **Lateral Movement and Collection**: The report indicates that APT10 used valid user credentials and Citrix servers for lateral movement and collected proprietary data using WinRAR and cURL for exfiltration.
- **Exfiltration and C2**: The report mentions that the exfiltration was done using Dropbox and the C2 communications were encrypted using RC4 and Salsa20.

However, the report does not mention any specific activities related to gathering encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services servers. The focus of the attack, as described, is on initial access, privilege escalation, defense evasion, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Step 1**: APT10 gained initial access using stolen valid user credentials.
- **Step 2**: They escalated privileges and evaded defenses using DLL sideloading techniques.
- **Step 3**: They moved laterally within the network using valid user accounts and Citrix servers.
- **Step 4**: They collected and exfiltrated proprietary data using WinRAR and cURL for Windows.
- **Step 5**: The C2 communications were encrypted using RC4 and Salsa20.

Given the sequence of activities described in the report, there is no indication that APT10 specifically targeted Azure AD services to gather encryption keys. The focus was on gaining access, moving laterally, and exfiltrating data.

**Final Answer: B: No**
