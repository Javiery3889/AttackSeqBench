### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Discovery:** The discovery phase involved profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group, and using PowerView to search for computer objects in the Active Directory.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption and ransom demands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Cobalt Strike will empty log files to aid in concealing the attackers' activities only after employing lateral movement through commands and process injection on remote computers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group to profile the computer.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services, which includes stopping services and disabling real-time monitoring. However, it does not explicitly state that log files were emptied.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not provide a clear sequence indicating that log files were emptied only after lateral movement. The defense evasion techniques mentioned (disabling Windows Defender and stopping services) are more general and could be applied at various stages of the attack.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that log files were emptied only after lateral movement. The defense evasion techniques mentioned are more general and could be applied at any stage of the attack to avoid detection.
   - Given the lack of specific information about the timing of log file emptying, it is not likely that this action was performed only after lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
