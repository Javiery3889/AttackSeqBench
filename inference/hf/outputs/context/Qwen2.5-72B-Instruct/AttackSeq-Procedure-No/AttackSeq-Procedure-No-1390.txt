### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employs passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and archives it.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use steganography to hide C2 communications before exfiltrating data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Methods:** The CTI report clearly states that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.
   - **C2 Communications:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses web shells and email communications (MAILSLOT) for C2.
   - **Steganography:** The report does not mention the use of steganography. Instead, it focuses on using web shells and legitimate utilities for stealth and evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed list of techniques used by FIN13, including the use of web shells and legitimate utilities for exfiltration and C2 communications.
   - There is no mention of steganography in the report, which suggests that it is not a technique used by FIN13.
   - Given the focus on web shells and other methods for stealth and evasion, it is more plausible that FIN13 does not use steganography for C2 communications.
