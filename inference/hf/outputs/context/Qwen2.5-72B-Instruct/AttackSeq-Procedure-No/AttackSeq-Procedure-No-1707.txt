### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Black Energy 2 uses encryption and code compression to hide its code from antivirus products.
- It infects system processes.
- Upon execution, it allocates virtual memory, copies its decryptor code, and passes control to the decryptor.
- A decryptor driver with a random name is created in the system32drivers directory, and a corresponding service is started.
- The driver acts as a wrapper for the malware's core components.

**Persistence:**
- Black Energy 2 maintains persistence by injecting a DLL into the svchost.exe user-mode process.
- The infector driver, which contains the malicious DLL, locates the svchost.exe process, allocates memory in its address space, and launches the injected library's code using APC queue processing.

**Command and Control:**
- The botnet's C&C center communicates with Black Energy 2 through HTTP requests.
- The bot sends a preformed HTTP request containing data that identifies the infected machine.
- The C&C responds with a bot configuration file, which is an encrypted XML document.
- The bot can receive general commands from the C&C, such as downloading and executing files, updating the bot, and setting contact frequency with the C&C server.

**Impact:**
- Black Energy 2 is primarily used to conduct DDoS attacks.
- It uses plugins like ddos, syn, and http to initiate mass connections and send random data packets to target servers.
- The malware can create a significant load on servers, especially when using the http plugin, which imitates an ordinary user visiting a page multiple times in a short period.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky Lab has identified over 4,000 modifications of Black Energy 2 since mid-2008.
- The malware has evolved to include plugins that extend its capabilities beyond DDoS attacks, potentially allowing for spam distribution, credential grabbing, and proxy server setup.
- Kaspersky Lab continues to monitor the evolution of Black Energy 2 and its plugins to track the threat's progression.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that Black Energy 2 will:
1. Allocate memory in the svchost.exe process and launch the injected library’s code using APC queue processing for persistence.
2. Evade defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Step 1: Allocate memory in the svchost.exe process and launch the injected library’s code using APC queue processing for persistence.**
- This is explicitly mentioned in the **Persistence** section of the CTI report.

**Step 2: Evade defenses by encrypting its payload and loading plugins directly onto the infected machine.**
- The **Execution** section mentions that Black Energy 2 uses encryption and code compression to hide its code from antivirus products.
- The **Impact** section mentions that it uses plugins to conduct DDoS attacks and has evolved to include additional capabilities.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly states that Black Energy 2 allocates memory in the svchost.exe process and launches the injected library’s code using APC queue processing for persistence.
- The report also mentions that the malware uses encryption and code compression to evade defenses and that it can load plugins directly onto the infected machine.

Given this information, it is likely that Black Energy 2 will perform both actions in the sequence described in the question.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
