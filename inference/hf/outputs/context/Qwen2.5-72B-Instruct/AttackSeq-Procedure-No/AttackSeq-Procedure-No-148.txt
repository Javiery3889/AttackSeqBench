### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 conducted reconnaissance to identify target networks.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) to maintain persistence, but also removed disk-resident tools for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and used in-memory execution to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit to map and scan the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 established command and control (C2) by using a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point after accessing shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropping the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of GitLab or Digital Point for C2.
   - The report emphasizes that TG1021 used in-memory execution and avoided continuous traffic to evade detection.
   - The report also mentions that TG1021 removed disk-resident tools after use to maintain stealth.
   - Given the emphasis on stealth and avoiding detection, it is plausible that TG1021 used a one-way communication method to establish C2, but the specific mention of GitLab and Digital Point is not supported by the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any information about the use of GitLab or Digital Point for C2.
   - The report focuses on the threat actor's efforts to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - While it is possible that TG1021 used a one-way communication method, the specific platforms mentioned (GitLab and Digital Point) are not supported by the report.
