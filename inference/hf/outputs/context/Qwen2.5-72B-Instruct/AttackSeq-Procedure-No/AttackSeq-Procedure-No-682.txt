### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Attackers used compromised websites to store malicious files.
     - Used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Built files on the host from base64.
     - Created public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - Conducted a massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, targeting supply-chain processes.
   - **Execution:**
     - Abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands.
     - Used cron utility to schedule local jobs.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software.
     - Used obfuscated files or information.
     - Executed fileless malware attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives include backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will gather detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report mentions that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports and created public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - The report also mentions a massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI, targeting supply-chain processes.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention detailed reconnaissance activities focused on gathering knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships.
     - The focus seems to be on exploiting known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations rather than conducting extensive reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access method described in the report (exploiting misconfigured Docker API ports and creating public registry accounts) suggests a more opportunistic approach rather than a highly targeted one.
   - The massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI indicates a broad, automated campaign rather than a detailed, targeted reconnaissance effort.
   - The report does not provide evidence of detailed reconnaissance activities focused on supply chain relationships.
