### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A new series of malware samples were submitted to Virus Total.
- The initial dropper malware is written in Delphi.
- The dropper downloads a second stage payload from the internet and executes it.
- The payload communicates with the server using the HTTPS protocol.

**Execution:**
- The malware initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server.
- It downloads the file 'upnphost.exe' to the path '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp'.
- The executable implements a persistence mechanism by setting a registry key.

**Persistence:**
- The executable 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain its foothold on the system.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The 'upnphost.exe' file was submitted to Virus Total, likely due to the evasion technique implemented by the dropper.
- The dropper was patched to reveal its complete malicious behavior.

**Discovery:**
- The malware sends information gathered on the operating system to the IP '45.124.132.127' using the command line 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- The server is located in Hong Kong according to WHOIS records.

**Others:**
- The attack threat map indicates a wide attack surface with C2Cs in Europe and China.
- Yara rules are provided for the dropper, first payload 'upnphost.exe', and second payload 'sdbn.dll' associated with APT28 XAGENT July 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After discovering system information using the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' and sending it to '45.124.132.127', is it likely that the malware will establish an HTTPS communication with the command and control server only after contacting the domain 'marina-info.net' for further operations?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** The dropper malware is executed and downloads a second stage payload.
2. **Execution:** The second stage payload ('upnphost.exe') is downloaded and executed.
3. **Persistence:** The payload sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
4. **Defense Evasion:** The dropper uses evasion techniques.
5. **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information and sends it to '45.124.132.127'.
6. **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS.

**Key Points:**
- The malware sends system information to '45.124.132.127' using the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo'.
- The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that the malware needs to contact 'marina-info.net' before establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the malware does not need to contact 'marina-info.net' before establishing HTTPS communication with the C2 server.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention any interaction with 'marina-info.net'.
- The report clearly states that the malware sends system information to '45.124.132.127' and then communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS.
- There is no indication that 'marina-info.net' is involved in the sequence of operations described in the report.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
