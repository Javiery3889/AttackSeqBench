### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
- Uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.
- Techniques: Obtain Capabilities, Compromise Infrastructure.

**Initial Access:**
- Delivers exploits through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.
- Also uses compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
- Technique: Drive-by Compromise.

**Execution:**
- Runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
- Techniques: Command and Scripting Interpreter, Exploitation for Client Execution.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
- Has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.

**Others:**
- Active since 2014, distributing various types of malware.
- Targets machines running outdated versions of Internet Explorer.
- High exploitation rate in 2022.
- Operates as a service model, distributing different types of malware for various threat actors.
- Most successful campaigns in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the Middle East.
- Highest exploit try rates and successful infections on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
- Close relationship with the developer of Dridex malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After RIG EK's exploit server returns encrypted exploit code using a custom version of the RC4 algorithm for establishing an encrypted channel in its command and control operations, is it likely that proxy servers will be used within its infrastructure to make infections harder to detect?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect (Defense Evasion).
- RIG EK uses an encrypted channel for command and control operations (implied by the mention of RC4 algorithm).

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
- The use of an encrypted channel (RC4 algorithm) is consistent with the goal of evading detection.
- The combination of using proxy servers and encrypted channels is a common tactic to enhance stealth and avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly indicates that RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
2. The use of an encrypted channel (RC4 algorithm) is consistent with the goal of evading detection.
3. Both techniques (proxy servers and encrypted channels) are part of the broader strategy to avoid detection and maintain persistence.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
