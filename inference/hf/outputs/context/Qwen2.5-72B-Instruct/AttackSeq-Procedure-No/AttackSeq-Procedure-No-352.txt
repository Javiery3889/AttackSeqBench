### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent to officials at Indian embassies.
- The emails carried a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
- The RTF document dropped an embedded, encoded PE file named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.

**Command and Control:**
- The MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with C&C servers.
- Some modules lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

**Others:**
- The APT is dubbed 'Operation Transparent Tribe.'
- The malware is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module.
- Functions include keylogging, browser credential theft, webcam spying, email theft, and screen recording.
- The malware supports at least 40 individual commands.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Following the initial access achieved through weaponized RTF documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file, is it likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing command and control using a custom TCP protocol?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
   - Drops an embedded PE file (svchost.exe) with downloader functionality.

2. **Command and Control:**
   - Uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with C&C servers.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the malware will execute native Windows functions (GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) before establishing C&C.
  - The report does not explicitly mention the execution of these specific native Windows functions before establishing C&C.
  - However, it is common for malware to gather system information (e.g., using GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo) to determine the environment and capabilities before establishing C&C to avoid detection and to tailor its actions.

- **B: No**
  - This suggests that the malware will not execute these native Windows functions before establishing C&C.
  - The report does not provide evidence that these functions are executed before C&C is established.

**Contextual Information:**
- The malware is modular and supports at least 40 individual commands, which suggests a sophisticated and multi-stage infection process.
- It is likely that the malware would gather system information to ensure it can operate effectively and avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly state that the malware executes GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo before establishing C&C.
- However, given the sophisticated nature of the MSIL/Crimson malware and its modular design, it is highly likely that the malware would gather system information before establishing C&C to ensure it can operate effectively and avoid detection.
- The execution of native Windows functions to gather system information is a common practice in advanced malware to tailor its actions and avoid detection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
