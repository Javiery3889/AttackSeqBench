### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Duke group used Trojan.Cozer (Cozyduke) to initiate their campaign.
- They sent 'Office Monkeys' and 'eFax'-themed emails containing a Cozyduke payload to compromise high-profile government networks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Seaduke, a low-profile information-stealing Trojan, hides behind multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation.
- It is designed to steal and exfiltrate sensitive information such as emails.

**Collection:**
- Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and securely delete the malware using a self-delete function named 'seppuku'.

**Command and Control:**
- Seaduke communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS with layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES).

**Exfiltration:**
- Seaduke archives sensitive information and exfiltrates data via legitimate cloud services and performs secure file deletion.

**Others:**
- The Duke group has been compromising governmental and diplomatic organizations since at least 2010.
- They have a range of malware tools known as the Dukes, including Cozyduke, Miniduke, and Cosmicduke.
- They have sophisticated operators with fine-tuned computer network exploitation skills.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if the Duke group is likely to leverage Seaduke to:
1. Retrieve system information.
2. Securely delete itself.
3. Use Mimikatz PowerShell to conduct Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks for credential access.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Retrieving System Information:**
- The CTI report clearly states that Seaduke allows attackers to retrieve detailed bot/system information. This aligns with the first part of the question.

**Securely Deleting Itself:**
- The CTI report mentions that Seaduke has a self-delete function named 'seppuku'. This aligns with the second part of the question.

**Using Mimikatz PowerShell for Kerberos Pass-the-Ticket Attacks:**
- The CTI report does not mention the use of Mimikatz or any specific credential access techniques. The report focuses on Seaduke's capabilities in information stealing, exfiltration, and secure deletion.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms that Seaduke is used to retrieve system information and securely delete itself.
- However, the report does not provide any evidence that the Duke group uses Mimikatz PowerShell for Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks in the context of Seaduke.

Given the information provided, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the CTI report is that the Duke group leverages Seaduke to retrieve system information and securely delete itself, but there is no evidence to support the use of Mimikatz PowerShell for Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks.

**Final Answer: B: No**
