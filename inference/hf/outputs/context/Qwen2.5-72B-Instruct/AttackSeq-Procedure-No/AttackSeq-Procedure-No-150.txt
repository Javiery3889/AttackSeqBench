### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (OST) to perform reconnaissance.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 utilized web shells and a custom malware framework that operates almost entirely in-memory. They also removed all disk-resident tools after use.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom versions of the Potato family tools and dynamic DLL loading, code injection, and token manipulation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded commercial EDRs, and used stealth techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to scan and map targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TG1021 used watering hole attacks with zero-day exploits to compromise targets before gaining initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention watering hole attacks. Instead, it focuses on the techniques used after gaining initial access.
   - The report states that TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - The report does not provide any evidence or context suggesting that watering hole attacks were used as an initial vector.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly outlines the initial access method as exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - There is no mention of watering hole attacks in the report.
   - The techniques described in the report, such as memory-resident malware, web shells, and other post-exploitation activities, are consistent with the initial access method described.
