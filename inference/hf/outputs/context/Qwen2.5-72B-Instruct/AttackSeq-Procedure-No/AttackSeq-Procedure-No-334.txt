### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware was detected in an executable file disguised as a PDF document.
- The spyware was delivered via spearphishing emails targeting diplomats.
- The spyware was signed with a previously unseen valid digital certificate.

**Command and Control:**
- Several C&C servers were identified, with IP addresses listed.

**Others:**
- The spyware was compiled between September 2015 and October 2017.
- The samples were signed with six different certificates.
- The functionality of the spyware overlaps with the leaked source code, with no significant updates confirmed.
- The spyware was detected in fourteen countries.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The initial access was achieved through spearphishing emails with a PDF-disguised executable.
- The spyware established communication with C&C servers.

**Question Context:**
- The question introduces the concept of a portable FAT16 partition image placed in %TEMP% as a hidden file system.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not mention any use of a portable FAT16 partition image or a hidden file system in %TEMP%.
- The report focuses on the initial access method (spearphishing) and the C&C communication.
- The functionality of the spyware is described as overlapping with the leaked source code, with no significant updates confirmed. This suggests that the spyware's methods are consistent with previously known techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report provides a clear sequence of events: initial access via spearphishing, followed by communication with C&C servers.
2. There is no mention of a portable FAT16 partition image or a hidden file system in %TEMP%.
3. The spyware's functionality is consistent with previously known techniques, suggesting no significant new methods were introduced.
4. Given the lack of evidence in the report supporting the use of a portable FAT16 partition image, it is unlikely that this method was used.

**Final Answer: B: No**
