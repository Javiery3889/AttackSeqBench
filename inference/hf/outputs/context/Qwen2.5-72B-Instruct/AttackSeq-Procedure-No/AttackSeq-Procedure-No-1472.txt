### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information and use active discovery methods to target potential victims.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT.
- Employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros, leading to the installation of the RAT.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware establishes a connection from the infected system to an attacker-controlled C2 server.
- This connection is established as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After performing a phishing campaign to deliver the BlackEnergy 3 RAT to target systems, is it likely that the adversaries will establish a Command and Control (C2) connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails crafted to resemble trustworthy senders?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The initial access is achieved through a phishing campaign where employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.
- The RAT is installed, and the malware establishes a C2 connection as part of its execution routine.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the C2 connection is established through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.
  - However, the CTI report clearly states that the C2 connection is established as part of the execution routine of the malware after the RAT is installed, not through additional clicks on hyperlinks.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that the C2 connection is not established through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.
  - This aligns with the CTI report, which indicates that the C2 connection is established as part of the malware's execution routine after the RAT is installed.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report specifies that the C2 connection is established as part of the malware's execution routine after the RAT is installed.
- The report does not mention any additional steps involving clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails to establish the C2 connection.
- Therefore, the correct answer is that the adversaries do not establish a C2 connection through clicking on malicious hyperlinks within emails.

**Final Answer: B: No**
