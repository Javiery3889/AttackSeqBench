### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain (falcancoin.io) that resembles a legitimate cryptocurrency-lending platform (Falcon Coin).
- The domain was created on December 27, 2017, and updated on February 19, 2018.
- The implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote access tool with full system capabilities and file-wiping functionality.

**Initial Access:**
- Financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document.
- The document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878) that allows the execution of arbitrary code.

**Execution:**
- The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx) and is downloaded and executed from the malicious domain (falcancoin.io).

**Persistence:**
- Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network for further exploitation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The implant is designed to evade detection and can wipe files to erase evidence.

**Command and Control:**
- The implants communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.
- The US government reports that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple industries, including financial organizations.

**Others:**
- The campaign is successful against unpatched Flash versions.
- The documents with the Flash exploit evaded static defenses and remained undetected on VirusTotal.
- This is the first time Bankshot has been tied to financial-related hacking and used since November 2017.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Hidden Cobra distributed Bankshot implants via a malicious domain resembling a cryptocurrency-lending platform during the resource development phase, is it likely that the group would use the Bankshot malware implant to collect information on victim organizations during their reconnaissance phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Resource Development:** The group used a domain resembling a legitimate cryptocurrency-lending platform to distribute Bankshot implants.
- **Initial Access and Execution:** The implants were delivered via spear phishing emails with a malicious Word document containing an embedded Flash exploit.
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** The implant is designed to persist and evade detection, with capabilities to wipe files.
- **Command and Control:** The implants communicate with control servers, indicating ongoing control and potential data exfiltration.

**Relevance to the Question:**
- The report indicates that Bankshot is a remote access tool with full system capabilities.
- The persistence and defense evasion features suggest that the attackers intend to maintain long-term access to the victim's network.
- The use of control servers and the capability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network (as seen in the Trojan Manuscript variant) indicate that the attackers are likely to collect information on victim organizations.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This is the most plausible answer. Given the capabilities of Bankshot and the intent to maintain long-term access, it is highly likely that the group would use the implant to collect information on victim organizations during the reconnaissance phase.
- **B: No** - This is less plausible. The report provides strong evidence that the attackers have the means and intent to collect information.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
