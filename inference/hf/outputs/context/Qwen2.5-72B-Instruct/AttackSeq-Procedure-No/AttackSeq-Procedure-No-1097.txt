### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file to exploit CVE-2011-0611.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** It targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Discovery:** It searches for files on hard drives and network drives, particularly those with specific patterns and non-English filenames.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected data is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information only after searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. However, it does mention that CosmicDuke targets a variety of software to steal credentials and searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Searching Removable Drives and Skipping File Types:** The report does not specifically mention searching removable drives or skipping certain file types during collection. It only mentions searching for files on hard drives and network drives with specific patterns and non-English filenames.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide evidence that CosmicDuke uses keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers. The report focuses on credential theft and file searching.
   - The report also does not mention searching removable drives or skipping certain file types during collection.
   - Given the information provided, it is unlikely that CosmicDuke would use these additional tools and methods as described in the question.
