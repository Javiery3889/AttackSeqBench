### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Word document that uses the DDE technique to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **Execution:** The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt, which then runs PowerShell. The first PowerShell command downloads and executes an encoded command, and the second command downloads a file, creates a batch file, and a registry entry for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses and avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto the victim's system.
   - **Others:** The document is distributed via a spoofed domain and uses themes like recent terrorist attacks to lure victims. The document is blank and downloads a version of Seduploader, which profiles the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely to observe the document hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts to enable malware to execute on system startup.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that the document uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands, which download and run encoded commands and create a batch file and registry entry for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion and Persistence:** The report mentions that the document creates a registry entry to ensure persistence. This is a common technique used by malware to ensure it runs on system startup.
   - **Hijacking Legitimate Application-Specific Startup Scripts:** The report does not explicitly mention hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts. However, creating a registry entry is a form of persistence that ensures the malware runs on system startup, which is a similar goal to hijacking startup scripts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The document uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands, which download and run encoded commands.
   - The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence.
   - Creating a registry entry is a common method to ensure malware runs on system startup.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts, the goal of ensuring persistence is achieved through the registry entry, which is a similar mechanism.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The document's use of a registry entry to ensure persistence aligns with the goal of hijacking legitimate application-specific startup scripts, which is to ensure the malware runs on system startup. Therefore, it is likely to observe the document using such techniques.
