### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Smooth Operator malware was distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
- The infected software package was signed by 3CX and notarized by Apple.
- Malicious code was inserted into a dynamic library (dylib) within the 3CX software, which then downloads and executes a second-stage payload.

**Execution:**
- Smooth Operator malware executes as part of the 3CX software.
- It creates a new thread to run its functionality and uses a constructor function within the dylib to initiate without affecting the normal usage of the library.

**Persistence:**
- Smooth Operator persists by abusing a legitimate component of the 3CX software package, ensuring it runs every time the libffmpeg.dylib is loaded.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process.
- It deletes itself from disk immediately after execution.
- The malware writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate.
- Traffic to the C2 server is obfuscated with a custom data encoding algorithm.

**Discovery:**
- Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including the OS version from the SystemVersion.plist file and domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json. This data is included in beacons or exfiltration.

**Collection:**
- Smooth Operator stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration.
- It extracts the OS version, hostname, beacon interval, and C2 index, which are included in every beacon.
- The second-stage payload UpdateAgent parses and extracts domain and account name values from the 3CX file config.json for exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
- It contains multiple C2 servers and randomly chooses a new server for each beacon. If one fails, it will try another.

**Others:**
- Smooth Operator targets macOS and infects victims when they install specific trojanised versions of the 3CX software.
- It implements a file lock to ensure only one instance is running and generates a unique victim ID.
- The malware sleeps for 7 to 20 days before beaconing and uses a time-seeded random algorithm to generate beacon intervals.
- It has an embedded list of 15 C2s and one URL for the 3CX website, all obfuscated.
- The malware maintains a beacon error count and has taskable functionality supported by command IDs.
- The second-stage payload is lightweight and likely meant to determine which victims to pursue with further stages.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After automatically exfiltrating collected data via the second-stage payload using a HTTP GET request, is it likely that the Smooth Operator malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Command and Control:**
  - Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS.
  - It uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
  - It contains multiple C2 servers and randomly chooses a new server for each beacon. If one fails, it will try another.

**Analysis:**
- The question asks if it is likely that the malware will establish communication with its C2 servers over HTTPS and use a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation after exfiltrating data via a HTTP GET request.
- The CTI report clearly states that Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS and uses a custom data encoding algorithm for obfuscation.
- The report does not specify the exact method (HTTP GET or POST) used for exfiltration, but it does mention that the malware uses HTTPS and custom encoding for C2 communication.

**Conclusion:**
- Given that the malware uses HTTPS and custom encoding for C2 communication, it is highly likely that it will continue to use these methods even after exfiltrating data via a HTTP GET request.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes
