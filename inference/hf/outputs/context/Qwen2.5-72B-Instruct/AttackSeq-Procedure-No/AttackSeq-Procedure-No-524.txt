### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
- The document contains encrypted script data and an external template that points to another document with malicious VBA macros.
- The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services and redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker.
- The VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time.
- The malware payload is concealed using image files and signed with valid certificates to appear trustworthy.

**Command and Control:**
- The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process.
- The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and awaits further commands.
- The communication protocol uses AES encryption.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access, is it likely that a COM object will be used to execute queries to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads a zip file containing components for the malware payload?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malicious Word document inside a ZIP file.
   - VBA macros in an external template.
   - Decryption of embedded data.
   - Dropping of 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Switching to a benign template.
   - Concealing payload with image files.
   - Signing with valid certificates.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - Process Hollowing.
   - Contacting C&C server.
   - Sending machine information.
   - Awaiting further commands.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This suggests that a COM object is used to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads additional components.
  - The CTI report does not mention the use of COM objects for gathering system information. Instead, it focuses on the VBA macros and PowerShell scripts for initial access and payload delivery.

- **B: No**
  - This suggests that a COM object is not used to gather system information before the PowerShell script downloads additional components.
  - The CTI report indicates that the VBA macros and PowerShell scripts are the primary methods for initial access and payload delivery. There is no mention of using COM objects for system information gathering at this stage.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the initial access and subsequent steps without mentioning the use of COM objects for gathering system information.
- The focus is on the VBA macros and PowerShell scripts for decrypting and dropping the payload.
- The report does not provide any evidence to support the use of COM objects for system information gathering before the PowerShell script downloads additional components.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
