### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Watering hole tactics were used to compromise websites related to North Korea.
     - Exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 were injected into these websites.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Chrome exploit vector involved chaining two vulnerabilities to execute custom shellcode.
     - The shellcode de-obfuscated strings, initialized a network connection, and downloaded a payload named 'dropper.dll'.
     - The dropper.dll checked for security software and, if none were detected, downloaded and executed three additional malware samples.
     - An Internet Explorer exploit vector using CVE-2020-0674 ran a PowerShell loader to infect victims with the same three malware variants.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers implemented checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The SLUB variant collected system information and captured screenshots, sending them to a Mattermost server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The SLUB malware communicated with a Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The SLUB malware exfiltrated system information and screenshots to the Mattermost server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will rely on parent PID spoofing to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation after initial access and execution of custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers used watering hole tactics and exploits to gain initial access.
     - Custom shellcode was executed to download and run a PowerShell loader.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of parent PID spoofing for privilege escalation.
     - The focus of the report is on the initial access, execution, and subsequent activities like defense evasion, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The attackers implemented checks for security software and used a Mattermost server for communication and exfiltration.
     - The report does not provide any specific details about privilege escalation techniques beyond the initial execution of the shellcode and PowerShell loader.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report does not mention any specific techniques for privilege escalation, such as parent PID spoofing.
   - The focus of the report is on the initial access, execution, and subsequent activities like defense evasion, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - Given the lack of explicit mention of parent PID spoofing and the focus on other aspects of the attack, it is less likely that the attackers relied on this specific technique for privilege escalation.
