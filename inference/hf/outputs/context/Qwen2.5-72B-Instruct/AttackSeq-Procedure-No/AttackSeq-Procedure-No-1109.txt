### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, which has been updated over time.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup' (display name: 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service').
   - **Credential Access:** The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information. It also searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with remote servers is via HTTP GET requests, FTP, and WebDav.
   - **Exfiltration:** Collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations only after collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a service.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information. It also searches removable drives for files, but it does not specify the order of these operations.
   - **Discovery Operations:** The report does not explicitly state that the file search and targeting of non-English filenames occur only after the collection of information using the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide a strict sequence for the collection and discovery operations. It mentions that CosmicDuke uses various methods to collect information, including keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, and it also searches for files on removable drives.
   - The order of these operations is not clearly defined, and it is possible that the file search could occur concurrently with or before the collection of information using the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the file search and targeting of non-English filenames occur only after the collection of information using the keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
