### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro.
- The macro is designed to execute PowerShell scripts.
- The scripts are encoded within the document itself, without downloading additional components.

**Execution:**
- Enabling the macro triggers the Document_Open() event.
- This event executes a series of functions:
  - One to execute sub-functions.
  - Another to manipulate images in the document.
  - A third to construct and execute the main PowerShell commands and scripts.

**Persistence:**
- The PowerShell script decodes the contents of the malicious document.
- It then executes another encoded PowerShell script.
- This results in readable scripts that drop various components into the `%Application Data%\Microsoft\CLR\*` directory.
- The main PowerShell file, `invoker.ps1`, uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor.

**Command and Control:**
- The PRB-Backdoor communicates with the C&C server at `hxxp://outl00k[.]net`.
- It sends and receives commands for various purposes, including:
  - Initializing connection.
  - Registering the machine.
  - Gathering browsing histories.
  - Stealing passwords.
  - Reading and writing files.
  - Executing shell commands.
  - Recording keyboard strokes.
  - Capturing screenshots.
  - Updating functions.
  - Gathering system information.

**Others:**
- The campaign uses phishing or spam to target users.
- Lure documents are designed with social engineering tactics.
- The campaign has evolved to be more effective and persistent.
- The latest sample indicates a shift in the subject matter of lure documents, suggesting a broader range of targets.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After employing obfuscation methods for the backdoor payload as part of defense evasion, is it likely that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence only after the initial access gained by embedding encoded PowerShell scripts within a malicious Microsoft Word document and executing these scripts through macro-triggered events?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The initial access is gained through a malicious Word document with a macro.
- The macro triggers the execution of encoded PowerShell scripts.
- These scripts are decoded and used to drop components for persistence.
- The final payload, PRB-Backdoor, is executed using `invoker.ps1`.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the sequence described in the CTI report.
  - The report clearly states that the initial access is gained through a malicious Word document with a macro.
  - The macro triggers the execution of encoded PowerShell scripts.
  - These scripts are then decoded and used to drop components for persistence.
  - The final payload, PRB-Backdoor, is executed using `invoker.ps1`.

- **B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the sequence described in the CTI report.
  - It suggests that the campaign would not use decoded scripts to drop components for persistence after the initial access, which is not supported by the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the sequence of events:
  1. Initial access through a malicious Word document with a macro.
  2. Execution of encoded PowerShell scripts triggered by the macro.
  3. Decoding of these scripts to drop components for persistence.
  4. Execution of the final payload, PRB-Backdoor, using `invoker.ps1`.
- This sequence matches the scenario described in the question.
- Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the campaign will use decoded scripts to drop components like `invoker.ps1` for persistence after the initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
