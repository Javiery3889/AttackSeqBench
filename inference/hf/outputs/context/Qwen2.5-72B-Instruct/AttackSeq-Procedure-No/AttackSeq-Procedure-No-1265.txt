### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Discovery:** The discovery phase involved profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group, and using PowerView to search for computer objects in the Active Directory.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the attackers will use Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers only after profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the discovery phase involved profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group, and using PowerView to search for computer objects in the Active Directory.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The report mentions that the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that the attackers used wmic.exe and PsExec for lateral movement and to execute commands on remote computers.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase is crucial for understanding the network topology and identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
   - The report clearly states that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group during the discovery phase to gather information about the environment.
   - After establishing a C&C connection, the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for various activities, including lateral movement.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the report: the attackers first profile the computer during the discovery phase and then use Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
