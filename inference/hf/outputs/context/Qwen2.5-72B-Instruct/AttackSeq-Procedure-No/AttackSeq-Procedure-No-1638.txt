### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using a PowerShell one-liner and relies on scheduled tasks for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and uses tools like NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's C2 protocol, initially encapsulated in DNS and later in HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and uses a custom tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary would encrypt data with the 3DES algorithm and a hardcoded key prior to exfiltration as part of their collection activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Details:**
     - The CTI report mentions that the adversary uses a custom tool to exfiltrate large amounts of data to cloud storage services.
     - The report does not specify the encryption algorithm used by this custom tool.
     - The report does not mention the use of 3DES or a hardcoded key for encryption.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The adversary uses Cobalt Strike, which has built-in capabilities for data exfiltration.
     - The custom tool is used for large data exfiltration, and the report does not provide specific details about the encryption methods used by this tool.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any information about the use of 3DES or a hardcoded key for encryption.
   - The report mentions that the custom tool is used for exfiltration but does not specify the encryption algorithm.
   - Given the lack of specific information about 3DES and a hardcoded key, it is not likely that the adversary would use this specific encryption method.
