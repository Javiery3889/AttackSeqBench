### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Machete campaign used spearphishing to gain initial access. Victims received emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** The downloader was used as the first stage, which installed the backdoor components. The downloader was a self-extracting file that opened a decoy document and then ran the executable.
   - **Persistence:** Machete created Windows Task Scheduler tasks and used hidden files and directories to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware used obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Machete scanned for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrated stored credentials.
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Machete used FTP and HTTP for C&C communication and implemented fallback channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted and exfiltrated to remote servers, with scheduled transfers every 10 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to use the `ipconfig /all` command to acquire information about local networks before collecting clipboard contents, logging keystrokes, and staging data in a temporary folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that Machete used spearphishing to gain initial access and then deployed a downloader to execute the malware.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder. However, it does not mention the use of the `ipconfig /all` command to gather network information.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report focuses on the specific data collection methods used by Machete, such as clipboard contents, keystrokes, and file copying, but does not indicate a need for network reconnaissance using `ipconfig /all`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any evidence that Machete uses the `ipconfig /all` command to gather network information before collecting data. The focus of the collection phase is on stealing clipboard contents, logging keystrokes, and staging data.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report and the specific methods mentioned for data collection, it is unlikely that Machete would use `ipconfig /all` as part of its collection process.
