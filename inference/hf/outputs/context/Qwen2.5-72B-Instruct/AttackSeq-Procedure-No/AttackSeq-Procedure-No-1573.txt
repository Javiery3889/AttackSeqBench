### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Used Windows utilities and third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Employed spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited public-facing server vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Abused elevation control mechanisms, created or modified system processes, and hijacked execution flow.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Used scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Exploited remote services, used internal spear phishing, and established network tunnels.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data from local systems and network shared drives, and used WinRAR and megacmd for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used application layer protocols, data obfuscation, encrypted channels, and remote access software.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Compressed files into archives and used cloud services for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz only after scanning for machines in the target's network environment using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report mentions that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - After discovering machines, they engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report also mentions that Earth Lusca used techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms and hijacking execution flow to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state the use of procdump and Mimikatz, it is common for threat actors to use such tools for credential access after gaining a foothold in the network and discovering potential targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather information using various tools.
     2. **Initial Access:** Gain initial access through spear phishing, watering hole attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
     3. **Execution:** Execute malicious code using command and scripting interpreters.
     4. **Persistence:** Ensure persistent access through services, tasks, and scripts.
     5. **Privilege Escalation:** Gain higher-level permissions using elevation control mechanisms.
     6. **Discovery:** Scan the network using tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan.
     7. **Lateral Movement:** Move laterally within the network using remote services and internal spear phishing.
     8. **Credential Access:** Target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.
     9. **Collection:** Collect data from local systems and network shared drives.
     10. **Command and Control:** Establish C&C communication.
     11. **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate data using cloud services and C2 channels.

   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is logical that after discovering machines in the network, Earth Lusca would move laterally and then target user credentials to gain further access and control.
