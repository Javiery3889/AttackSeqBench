### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- GreyEnergy targets energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland.
- Activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password and credential stealing.
- Targets ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

**Resource Development:**
- Modular malware framework.
- Mini backdoor deployed before admin rights are obtained.
- C&C servers are active Tor relays for operational security.

**Initial Access:**
- Two infection vectors: spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
- Lateral movement from compromised web servers to other workstations.

**Persistence:**
- Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives to cover tracks.

**Credential Access:**
- Use of common external tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks to redirect requests to external C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**
- Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

**Others:**
- Linked to BlackEnergy and TeleBots subgroups.
- More modern toolkit with a focus on stealth.
- Some samples signed with a stolen certificate from Advantech.
- Deployed an early version of the TeleBots' NotPetya worm.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access, is GreyEnergy likely to inject shellcode into svchost.exe before running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access. This aligns with the question.

**Persistence and Evasion:**
- The report mentions that GreyEnergy securely wipes malware components from victims' hard drives to cover tracks. This indicates a focus on stealth and evasion.
- The modular nature of the malware and the use of a mini backdoor before admin rights are obtained suggest a sophisticated approach to persistence and evasion.

**Fileless Techniques:**
- While the report does not explicitly mention injecting shellcode into svchost.exe, it does highlight the use of a modular framework and the deployment of a mini backdoor. Fileless techniques are a common method to evade detection and analysis.
- The focus on stealth and the use of internal C&C proxies further support the likelihood of using fileless techniques to avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- GreyEnergy's initial access methods (spearphishing and compromising web servers) align with the question.
- The report emphasizes the group's focus on stealth and evasion, which is consistent with the use of fileless techniques.
- While not explicitly stated, the modular nature of the malware and the use of a mini backdoor suggest that GreyEnergy is capable of and likely to use advanced evasion techniques, including fileless execution.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
