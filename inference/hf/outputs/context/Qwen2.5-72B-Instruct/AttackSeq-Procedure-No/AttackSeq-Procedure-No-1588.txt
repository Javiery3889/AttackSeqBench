### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Execution:**
     - They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
     - Example: Created a service named "SysUpdate" to launch a Cobalt Strike loader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Various techniques such as account manipulation, BITS jobs, creating accounts, modifying system processes, and leveraging external remote services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms, creating or modifying system processes, and hijacking execution flow.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms, BITS jobs, deobfuscating/decoding files, hiding artifacts, and using signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data from local systems and network shared drives, and used WinRAR and megacmd for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used application layer protocols, data obfuscation, encrypted channels, and remote access software.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Compressed files into archives and used megacmd to upload them to cloud accounts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca would abuse default user names and passwords in externally-accessible IP cameras for initial access before executing commands to create a fake system update service for deploying Cobalt Strike.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions the use of adfind and PowerSploit for gathering information about the domain and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of default user names and passwords in externally-accessible IP cameras for initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report does mention the creation of a fake system update service to deploy Cobalt Strike.
   - **Context:**
     - The report focuses on sophisticated techniques and tools, suggesting a high level of sophistication in the attack.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of default user names and passwords in IP cameras, it is possible that such a method could be used for initial access. However, the report emphasizes the use of more sophisticated techniques and tools, which suggests that Earth Lusca prefers more advanced methods.
   - The creation of a fake system update service to deploy Cobalt Strike is clearly mentioned and aligns with the execution phase described in the report.
   - Given the sophistication of the techniques used by Earth Lusca, it is less likely that they would rely on default user names and passwords in IP cameras for initial access.

### Final Answer: B: No
