### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, showing advanced reconnaissance capabilities.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sharing sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy malware components like downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Collection:** They collect secrets from local systems, including cached passwords and credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Darkhotel APT is likely to target chat messages in collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, JIRA, or Confluence for credential access before using sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that the Darkhotel APT collects various secrets stored on local systems, including cached passwords and credentials from multiple browsers and email services. However, it does not explicitly mention targeting chat messages in collaboration tools.
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:** The report clearly states that the Darkhotel APT uses digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report suggests that the Darkhotel APT's primary focus in the collection phase is on local system secrets, which are likely to include browser and email credentials. Targeting chat messages in collaboration tools is not explicitly mentioned and seems less likely given the focus on local system data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT's primary collection methods involve gathering secrets from local systems, which include cached passwords and credentials from browsers and email services.
   - The report does not provide evidence that they specifically target chat messages in collaboration tools like Slack, Teams, JIRA, or Confluence.
   - The use of digital certificates and encryption for defense evasion is a well-documented and sophisticated capability of the Darkhotel APT.
   - Given the focus on local system data and the sophistication of their defense evasion techniques, it is less likely that they would target chat messages in collaboration tools before employing these advanced techniques.
