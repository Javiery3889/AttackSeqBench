### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with social engineering tactics, luring victims into opening malicious email attachments or downloading reports.
   - **Execution:** The malicious documents contained embedded macros that, when enabled, downloaded and executed the Pierogi backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Pierogi backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor checked for antivirus and security products and used techniques like file deletion and software packing to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor collected information about the infected machine, including computer name, username, GUID, antivirus name, and operating system version.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor could take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated through web services, with screenshots uploaded to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Pierogi backdoor is likely to establish a multi-stage channel by first connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy before communicating with a second C2 server after conducting discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report clearly states that the backdoor collects system information such as computer name, username, and operating system version.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that data exfiltration is performed through web services, with screenshots uploaded to the C2 server.
   - **Multi-Stage Channel:** The report does not mention any use of a SOCKS5 proxy or a multi-stage communication channel. The exfiltration method described is direct communication with the C2 server via web services.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the methods used for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, collection, and exfiltration.
   - The report specifically mentions that the backdoor exfiltrates data through web services to the C2 server.
   - There is no indication in the report that the backdoor uses a SOCKS5 proxy or any other intermediate step before communicating with the C2 server.
   - Given the simplicity and direct nature of the exfiltration method described, it is unlikely that the backdoor would establish a multi-stage channel involving a SOCKS5 proxy.
