### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. The dropper was disguised as an invitation to a G20 task force meeting.
   - **Execution:** The MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. The JavaScript dropper installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The JavaScript dropper Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion. The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Discovery:** Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file. The commands include checking for Kaspersky Lab directories and performing a traceroute to www.google.com.
   - **Command and Control:** The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Exfiltration:** The updated KopiLuwak backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C&C and download files to the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Scr.js will install itself as a cron job before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fingerprinting and Discovery:** The report states that Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and performs discovery tasks by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that Scr.js sets up persistence without raising suspicion. However, it does not specify the method of persistence (e.g., cron job, registry key, etc.).
   - **Execution of Backdoor:** The report indicates that the JavaScript dropper installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory. The dropper writes the Stage1 JS and decoy PDF to %APPDATA% for execution.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that Scr.js installs itself as a cron job. Instead, it mentions that Scr.js sets up persistence without raising suspicion, which could be achieved through various methods, not necessarily a cron job.
   - The sequence of events described in the report suggests that after fingerprinting and discovery, the backdoor is executed in memory. The installation of a cron job is not a necessary step in this sequence.
   - The task PolicyConverter and the file appidpolicyconverter.js are not mentioned in the report, so we cannot confirm their role in the attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The report does not provide evidence that Scr.js installs itself as a cron job before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code. The persistence mechanism is mentioned but not specified, and the sequence of events described does not include this step.
