### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
     - Initial reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
     - Second spear phish with a remote template to deliver a payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - Use remote templates in Microsoft Word to load an external template.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploy PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
     - POWERSHOWER fingerprints the machine, uploads information to C&C, and potentially runs a secondary payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
     - Use POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make it harder for researchers to analyze more sophisticated payloads.
   - **Discovery:**
     - POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER will enter a communications loop with the C2 server only before collecting system information on the infected machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - From the CTI report, we know that POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server.
   - The report does not explicitly state that POWERSHOWER enters a communications loop with the C2 server before collecting system information.
   - The sequence described in the report suggests that POWERSHOWER first collects system information and then sends it to the C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that POWERSHOWER's actions include collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server.
   - There is no mention of a communications loop before the collection of system information.
   - The logical sequence based on the report is that POWERSHOWER collects system information first and then sends it to the C2 server.
