### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, used techniques T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry) to steal stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard protocols (T1043, T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion only before exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution without user interaction.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs in the CTI Report:**
     1. Initial Access (T1193)
     2. Execution (T1204)
     3. Credential Access (T1003, T1081, T1214)
     4. Collection (T1005)
     5. Command and Control (T1043, T1071)
     6. Exfiltration (T1002)
   - **Question Focus:**
     - The question specifically asks about the use of T1107 (File Deletion) before the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (T1204).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **T1107 (File Deletion):** This technique is used to delete files to evade detection and analysis. It is typically employed after the initial exploitation to remove traces of the attack.
   - **CVE-2017-11882 (T1204):** This vulnerability is exploited to execute code silently, which is part of the initial execution phase.
   - **Sequence Analysis:**
     - The CTI report indicates that the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (T1204) occurs before the credential access phase (T1003, T1081, T1214).
     - There is no mention of T1107 (File Deletion) in the report, and it would be unusual to delete files before the initial exploitation to avoid raising suspicion or losing the ability to execute the payload.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The sequence of TTPs in the CTI report does not support the use of T1107 (File Deletion) before the exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 (T1204). It is more likely that file deletion would be used after the initial exploitation to cover tracks and evade detection.
