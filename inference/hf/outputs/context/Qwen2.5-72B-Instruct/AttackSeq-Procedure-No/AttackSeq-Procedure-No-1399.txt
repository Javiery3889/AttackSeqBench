### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumps LSASS, uses network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting sensitive data from network shared drives and archiving it locally or remotely using utilities and libraries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Defense Evasion and Communication:** The report indicates that FIN13 uses JSPRAT for network traffic proxying and other tools for stealth and command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses proxies for communication and command and control only after collecting and archiving data. Instead, it suggests that FIN13 uses various tools and techniques throughout the attack lifecycle for different purposes, including exfiltration and command and control.
   - The use of proxies and web shells for command and control is a continuous process, not necessarily tied to the specific stage of data collection and archiving.
   - The sequence described in the question (using proxies only after collecting and archiving data) is not supported by the information in the report.
