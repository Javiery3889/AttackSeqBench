### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries use worms to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts.
     - Scanning tools like masscan are employed to increase the frequency of scanning activity.
     - Public search engines like Shodan or Censys are used.
     - The function DOCKERGEDDON, containing masscan and zgrab, is used to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs, collect information about the host, and deploy a malicious container.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Built files on the host from base64.
     - Created public registry accounts that mimic popular software or packages.
     - Massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI.
   - **Execution:**
     - Abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Used cmd or entry point to execute commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Scheduled local jobs using the cron utility.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
     - Used external remote services like IRC channels.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software to avoid detection.
     - Used obfuscated files or information.
     - Executed fileless malware attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
     - Used data encoding to compile binary files.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives such as backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft are emerging.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that adversaries would use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - This phase involves identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address. This is a preparatory step to gather information and resources that can be used in subsequent phases.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that adversaries use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase to scan entire netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after gathering resources (Resource Development), adversaries move to the Reconnaissance phase to actively scan and identify vulnerable hosts.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - It is logical that after identifying domains resolving to the same IP address, adversaries would use tools like DOCKERGEDDON to scan these netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that adversaries use DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase.
   - The Resource Development phase involves identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address.
   - The logical next step after Resource Development is to use the gathered information to perform Reconnaissance.
   - Therefore, it is likely that adversaries would use functions like DOCKERGEDDON during the Reconnaissance phase after identifying and using domains resolving to the same IP address during the Resource Development phase.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
