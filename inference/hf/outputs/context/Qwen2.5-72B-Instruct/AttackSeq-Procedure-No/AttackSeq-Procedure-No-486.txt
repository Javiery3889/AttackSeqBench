### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to retrieve metadata for files on disk and list the current working directory during the Discovery phase before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the Discovery phase. However, it is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework for attackers to gather information about the system and network before moving to the Collection phase.
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Logical Sequence:** It is logical for an attacker to first discover what files and directories are available before deciding which files to read and exfiltrate. This would involve listing directories and retrieving metadata.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow would likely perform the Discovery phase activities (retrieving metadata and listing directories) before moving to the Collection phase.
   - **B: No** - This choice suggests that FamousSparrow would not perform these Discovery phase activities.

### Final Reasoning
Given the logical sequence of operations in a typical cyber attack and the common practice of performing Discovery before Collection, it is highly likely that FamousSparrow would retrieve metadata for files on disk and list the current working directory before reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
