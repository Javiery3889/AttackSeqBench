### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Deployed a loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) that established persistence via a registry key.
     - Attempted to disable specific antivirus processes.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
     - Utilized backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida to communicate with C&C servers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placed a copy of the loader/spreader malware in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Set a registry key for automatic execution.
     - Attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Killed specific antivirus processes using the taskkill command line tool.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
     - Packed backdoor malware with Themida to evade analysis and detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Copied the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
     - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses, targeting active and responding devices.
     - Established connections to SMB shares using the provided credentials.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote C&C servers.
     - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number.
     - Polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute, maintaining a communication session and executing remote commands as directed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Lazarus group used backdoor malware to communicate with command-and-control servers and execute remote commands only after deploying Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
   - The report focuses on the initial stages of the attack, including the deployment of loader/spreader malware, backdoor malware, and the establishment of persistence and C&C communication.
   - The sequence of events described in the report does not indicate that the backdoor malware was used only after deploying Hermes ransomware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report describes the initial stages of the attack, including the deployment of loader/spreader malware and backdoor malware.
   - The backdoor malware was used to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands from the beginning of the attack.
   - There is no mention of deploying Hermes ransomware or deleting Volume Shadow Copies and backup files in the provided report.
   - Therefore, the backdoor malware was used to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands before any mention of deploying Hermes ransomware.
