### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
     - They use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
     - Subsequent spear-phishing emails with MS Word or PowerPoint documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-6352.
     - Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a malicious PowerPoint document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
     - Encoded blobs are downloaded and decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Encoded blobs are used to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
     - Resilient communications are used, with C2 server locations hidden in comments on legitimate websites.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant will download encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts for defense evasion after the file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions for automated collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Defense Evasion:**
     - The report clearly states that the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
     - This method is used for defense evasion.
   - **File-Stealer Module:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention a file-stealer module iterating through directories to collect files with specific extensions.
     - However, the question assumes this step has already occurred.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The backdoor's behavior of downloading and decoding encoded blobs for defense evasion is a consistent part of the attack sequence described in the report.
     - The file-stealer module's activity, while not explicitly mentioned, is a plausible step in the attack lifecycle, especially given the focus on collecting sensitive data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor's behavior of downloading and decoding encoded blobs for defense evasion is a well-documented part of the attack sequence.
   - The file-stealer module's activity, while not explicitly mentioned, is a logical step in the attack lifecycle, especially for a threat actor focused on collecting sensitive information.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that after the file-stealer module collects files, the backdoor will continue its defense evasion techniques, including downloading and decoding encoded blobs.
