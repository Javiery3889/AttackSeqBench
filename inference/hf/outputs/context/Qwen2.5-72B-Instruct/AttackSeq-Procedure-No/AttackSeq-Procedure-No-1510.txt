### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures after business hours or on weekends.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents designed to download a Cobalt Strike beacon component.
   - **Execution:** The adversary downloaded and executed new payloads, ran shell commands to move laterally, and deleted files to leave fewer forensic traces.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure, compromising a Domain Administrator account.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Carbanak group minimized detection by performing operations outside business hours, limiting interaction, and using single workstations as a hub.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network, collecting administrative level credentials and compromising additional network endpoints.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations in search of critical information.
   - **Collection:** The attackers collected and prepared valuable documents for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers prepared and exfiltrated documents related to internal applications and procedures.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group conducted LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials before compromising credentials for a Domain Administrator and using them to compromise additional endpoints.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the organization's internal network and collect administrative-level credentials. This aligns with the use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks, which are common techniques for network discovery and credential harvesting.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report states that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials to move across the entire infrastructure, compromising a Domain Administrator account. This is consistent with the use of LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks to collect administrative credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report also mentions that the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations. This is consistent with the use of collected administrative credentials to compromise additional endpoints.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Carbanak group used the Cobalt Strike beacon for network discovery and credential collection.
   - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay attacks are effective techniques for network discovery and credential harvesting.
   - The report indicates that the attackers collected administrative-level credentials and used them to compromise a Domain Administrator account.
   - The use of these techniques aligns with the Carbanak group's tactics for network discovery and privilege escalation.
