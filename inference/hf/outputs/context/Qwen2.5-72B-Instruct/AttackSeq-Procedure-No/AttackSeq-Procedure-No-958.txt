### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe were used for reconnaissance.
     - A backdoor named CommsCacher and its configuration file encrypted with the VEST algorithm were used to monitor RDP sessions.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
     - These documents activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and the backdoor CommsCacher.
     - The Windows command line and a malicious exported function in the SQLite DLL library were used.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using sc.exe and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created, and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders at C:\ProgramData.
     - Malware samples were removed from the file system.
     - rundll32.exe was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally.
     - A data encryption algorithm was used to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware used HTTP to connect to C2 servers disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus Group will enumerate Active Directory trusts using `nltest.exe /domain_trusts` before moving laterally within the network using compromised legitimate privileged accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:**
     - The report mentions that the attackers used system utilities for reconnaissance and compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
     - However, the specific use of `nltest.exe /domain_trusts` is not mentioned in the report.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report indicates that the attackers used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files and hiding malware.
     - After evading defenses, the next logical step would be to gather more information about the network to facilitate lateral movement.
     - Enumerating Active Directory trusts using `nltest.exe /domain_trusts` is a common technique for gathering such information.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The Lazarus Group is known for thorough and methodical attacks, often using a combination of publicly available tools and custom malware.
     - Given their sophistication, it is plausible that they would use `nltest.exe /domain_trusts` to gather information about domain trusts before moving laterally.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state the use of `nltest.exe /domain_trusts`.
   - However, the sequence of actions described in the report (reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, and lateral movement) suggests a methodical approach.
   - Enumerating Active Directory trusts is a logical step to take after evading defenses and before moving laterally, as it provides valuable information about the network structure.
   - Given the sophistication of the Lazarus Group, it is highly likely that they would use such a technique to gather necessary information.
