### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The threat actor uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
     - Spear-phishing with MS Word documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or PowerPoint documents exploiting CVE-2014-6352.
     - Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a PowerPoint document to view the entire article, which contains a malicious artifact.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Collection:**
     - The file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
     - The group uses resilient communications, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Dropping Elephant threat actor will use steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files before evading detection by decoding the encoded blobs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Spear-Phishing and Watering Hole Attacks:**
     - The report confirms that these are the initial access methods used by Dropping Elephant.
   - **Decoding Encoded Blobs:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Steganography:**
     - The report does not mention the use of steganography to hide malicious executables within PNG files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by Dropping Elephant, including the use of spear-phishing, watering hole attacks, and the decoding of encoded blobs.
   - However, there is no mention of steganography being used to hide malicious executables within PNG files.
   - The use of steganography is a more advanced and less common technique that is not indicated in the provided CTI report.
