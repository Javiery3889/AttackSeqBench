### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
     - Archive files with legitimate executables and malicious DLLs for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Through 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Injection into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - C&C servers operate within limited daily windows.
     - Fileless loading techniques.
     - Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:**
     - Capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.
     - Sending collected data to the C&C domain with an XORed password.
     - Listening for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Naikon APT group used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with the C&C server before using the Aria-body backdoor to gather information about active processes during its discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the Naikon APT group operated C&C servers within limited daily windows and used fileless loading techniques to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report states that the Naikon APT group used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.
   - **Collection:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to enumerate process loaded modules, which is part of the discovery phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the information provided in the CTI report:
     - **Defense Evasion:** The group used limited time windows and fileless loading techniques.
     - **Command and Control:** They used HTTP and TCP protocols for communication.
     - **Collection:** The Aria-body backdoor has the capability to enumerate process loaded modules, which is a discovery phase activity.
