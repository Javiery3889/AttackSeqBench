### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers exploit a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files.
- These files are used to target public sectors and cryptocurrency-related organizations.
- The attackers impersonate government institutions or organizations to distribute the malware.
- The activity has increased due to the COVID-19 situation, particularly in April 2020.

**Collection:**
- The report includes a collection of malicious HWP file samples from January to May 2020.
- These files target specific professions or groups.
- The files often impersonate government inquiries or job-related documents.

**Others:**
- AhnLab's anti-malware product, V3, detects and blocks HWP malware using various aliases.
- The report suggests the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms and emphasizes the importance of continuous analysis and assessment.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection, is it likely that attackers will exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files for initial access only after using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
   - Impersonate government institutions or organizations to distribute the malware.

2. **Collection:**
   - Target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if the attackers will use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion before exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files for initial access.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not mention the use of simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.
- The report focuses on the exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability through HWP files for initial access and the targeting of specific groups for collection.
- The report suggests that the attackers use HWP files directly to exploit the vulnerability and gain initial access, without any mention of a prior step involving EPS files for defense evasion.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the attackers use HWP files to exploit the Ghostscript vulnerability for initial access.
- There is no indication in the report that the attackers use simplified PostScript syntax in EPS files for defense evasion before the HWP file exploitation.
- The sequence described in the question (using EPS files for defense evasion before HWP file exploitation) is not supported by the information provided in the CTI report.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
