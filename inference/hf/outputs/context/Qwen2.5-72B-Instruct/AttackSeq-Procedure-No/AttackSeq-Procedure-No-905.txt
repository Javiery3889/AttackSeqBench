### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved through a phishing email disguised as a communication from UPS.
     - The email contained a link that redirected the victim to a SharePoint URL, which downloaded a ZIP file named "Data.zip".
     - The ZIP file included a VBS script that dropped another script, launching a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The threat actor performed typical escalation attempts in the Active Directory from the compromised client.
     - After ensuring admin privileges, the attacker used RunPsExec to install a PowerShell RAT.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and data discovery.
   - **Collection:**
     - Data was exfiltrated using the SmartFTP Client.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The CARBANAK RAT beaconed to the Command-and-Control server at 170.130.55[.]85:443.
     - The PowerShell RAT communicated with the domain hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data was exfiltrated using the SmartFTP Client.
   - **Impact:**
     - RYUK ransomware was deployed a week after reconnaissance and data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attacker will use the CARBANAK RAT to establish a connection with a Command-and-Control server only after gaining initial access through a phishing email that delivered a ZIP file containing a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was indeed achieved through a phishing email that delivered a ZIP file containing a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attacker performed privilege escalation using RunPsExec to deploy a PowerShell RAT.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The CARBANAK RAT was used to establish a connection with a Command-and-Control server at 170.130.55[.]85:443.
     - The PowerShell RAT also communicated with a different domain (hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report shows that the attacker first gained initial access, then performed privilege escalation, and subsequently established command and control using both the CARBANAK RAT and the PowerShell RAT.
   - The CARBANAK RAT was used to establish a connection with the Command-and-Control server after the initial access and privilege escalation stages.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the attacker used the CARBANAK RAT to establish a connection with a Command-and-Control server only after gaining initial access through a phishing email that delivered a ZIP file containing a VBS script to drop a JavaScript backdoor.
