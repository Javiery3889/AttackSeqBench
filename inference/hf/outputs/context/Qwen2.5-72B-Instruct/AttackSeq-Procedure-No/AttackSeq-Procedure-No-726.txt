### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** The worm executed malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, to maintain control and spread.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers and modified system files and registry keys to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stuxnet used MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The worm used rootkit functionality, stolen digital certificates, and patched system libraries to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Stuxnet exploited MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities to spread laterally through the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Stuxnet is likely to use the FTP protocol for C2 (Command and Control) communication after exploiting the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report confirms that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of FTP for C2 communication. Instead, it focuses on the worm's ability to execute code, maintain persistence, and evade detection.
   - **Common C2 Protocols:** Typically, advanced malware like Stuxnet uses more sophisticated and stealthy methods for C2 communication, such as HTTPS, DNS, or custom protocols, rather than FTP, which is more easily detectable and less secure.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report clearly states that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 and MS10-061 vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not provide any information about FTP being used for C2 communication. Given the advanced nature of Stuxnet and its focus on stealth and evasion, it is unlikely that it would use a protocol as detectable and insecure as FTP for C2 communication.
   - **Common Practices:** Advanced malware often uses more secure and less detectable methods for C2 communication to avoid detection by network security systems.
