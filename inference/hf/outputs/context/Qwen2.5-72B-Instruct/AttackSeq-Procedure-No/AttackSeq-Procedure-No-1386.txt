### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks, capture credentials, and steal sensitive documents.
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** They use LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** They use native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies and web shells for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will exploit client software vulnerabilities (e.g., Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158) for execution after gaining initial access via web shells and custom malware, before establishing persistence with tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** After gaining initial access, FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including trojanized KeePass binaries and SIXPACK.
   - **Client Software Vulnerabilities:** The report does not mention the exploitation of client software vulnerabilities like Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158. The focus is on web shells and custom malware for initial access and persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report suggests a sequence where initial access is gained through web shells and custom malware, followed by the use of persistence tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 uses web shells and custom malware to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** Immediately after gaining initial access, they establish persistence using tools like SIXPACK and trojanized KeePass binaries.
   - **Client Software Vulnerabilities:** There is no indication in the report that FIN13 exploits client software vulnerabilities for execution after gaining initial access and before establishing persistence.
