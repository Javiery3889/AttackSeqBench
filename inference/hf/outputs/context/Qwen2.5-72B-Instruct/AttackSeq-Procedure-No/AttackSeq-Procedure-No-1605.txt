### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India, often using LNK files and decoy documents.
   - **Resource Development:** Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains and uses phishing portals to trick victims into divulging credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts, verifying requests from specific geographies.
   - **Exfiltration:** Targets Kavach authentication databases and uses njRAT malware with special victim IDs.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and delivering payloads via a convoluted infection chain.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that SideCopy uses malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a convoluted infection chain involving multiple HTAs and loader DLLs.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also mentions that SideCopy exfiltrates Kavach authentication databases using njRAT malware with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state that exfiltration of Kavach databases happens only after gaining initial access through malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain. However, it is implied that the initial access and infection chain are necessary steps before exfiltration can occur.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The use of malicious LNK files and a convoluted infection chain is a consistent method for SideCopy to gain initial access.
   - **Exfiltration:** The exfiltration of Kavach authentication databases is a key objective of SideCopy, and it is logical that this would occur after gaining initial access and delivering the necessary payloads.
   - **Consistency:** The report does not suggest any alternative methods for exfiltration that bypass the initial access and infection chain.
