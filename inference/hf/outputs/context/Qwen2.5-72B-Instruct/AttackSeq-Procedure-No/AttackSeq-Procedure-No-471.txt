### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Charming Kitten uses spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained through spear-phishing methods, including emails and SMS messages impersonating Google Drive, Yahoo services, and social networks.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses tactics like redirecting victims to legitimate services, self-signed digital certificates, and domain shortening services to conceal malicious URLs.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Directs victims to phishing pages that impersonate login pages for services like Google Drive and Yahoo to steal credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten will develop phishing sites only after leveraging them to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Charming Kitten gathers information through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - They use the gathered information to gain initial access through spear-phishing attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - They direct victims to phishing pages to steal credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - They use various techniques to evade detection, including redirecting to legitimate services and using self-signed certificates.

   The sequence described in the CTI report is:
   1. **Reconnaissance** (gathering information)
   2. **Initial Access** (using gathered information to gain access)
   3. **Credential Access** (stealing credentials through phishing pages)
   4. **Defense Evasion** (evading detection)

   The question asks if Charming Kitten will develop phishing sites only after gaining initial access. However, the CTI report indicates that the phishing sites are used as part of the initial access phase to steal credentials. Therefore, the phishing sites are developed and used before gaining initial access, not after.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct answer is **B: No**.

**Final Answer: B: No**
