### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset from Gmail, Apple iCloud, Etisalat, OWA outlook.
- SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages.
- Domain typo squatting.
- Domains resolve only 1 day during the attack then shutdown.
- Anonymous domains registered with freenom.com for free: .ml, .tk, .ga, gq.
- Use of HTTPS on credential harvesting landing pages with free SSL certificates from let's encrypt or COMODO.

**Execution:**
- Use of emails related to previous interactions having links to drive-by downloads delivering malware or direct malware attachments, usually within an archive.
- Weaponization and reuse of malware from different threat actors.
- Reuse of command and control infrastructure from other groups.
- Separation between spear phishing infrastructure and malware C2 infrastructure to avoid attribution, suspicions, and takedowns.

**Credential Access:**
- Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or reset from Gmail, Apple iCloud, Etisalat, OWA outlook.
- SMS redirecting to credential harvesting pages.
- Domain typo squatting.
- Domains resolve only 1 day during the attack then shutdown.
- Anonymous domains registered with freenom.com for free: .ml, .tk, .ga, gq.
- Use of HTTPS on credential harvesting landing pages with free SSL certificates from let's encrypt or COMODO.

**Command and Control:**
- Use of emails related to previous interactions having links to drive-by downloads delivering malware or direct malware attachments, usually within an archive.
- Weaponization and reuse of malware from different threat actors.
- Reuse of command and control infrastructure from other groups.
- Separation between spear phishing infrastructure and malware C2 infrastructure to avoid attribution, suspicions, and takedowns.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after using fake social media personas to gather identifiable information and employing social media mobile apps to steal contact lists, emails, and SMS contents as part of reconnaissance, it is likely that WINDSHIFT APT will subsequently access external victim-owned websites for target development.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of fake social media personas or social media mobile apps for reconnaissance. However, it does describe a detailed initial access phase involving credential harvesting through emails and SMS.

**Target Development:**
- The report focuses on initial access and credential harvesting, followed by the use of these credentials to deliver malware and establish command and control. It does not explicitly state that WINDSHIFT APT accesses external victim-owned websites for target development.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report emphasizes the use of spear phishing and credential harvesting to gain initial access and then deliver malware. The focus is on gaining access to the target's systems and establishing a foothold, rather than accessing external websites for further target development.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report primarily describes the initial access and credential harvesting phases, followed by the delivery of malware and establishment of command and control.
- While the use of fake social media personas and social media mobile apps for reconnaissance is not explicitly mentioned, the report does not provide evidence that WINDSHIFT APT accesses external victim-owned websites for target development.
- The focus of the attack sequence is on gaining initial access and delivering malware, rather than further external reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B: No**
