### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Execution:** The ThreatNeedle malware was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware was used to achieve persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques were used to evade detection, including deleting log files and using custom web shells.
   - **Credential Access:** A credential harvesting tool named Responder was used to acquire login credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The group conducted extensive discovery activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Command and Control:** Multiple servers were used, and a compromised router was configured as a proxy.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to exfiltrate collected data through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool before archiving it using utilities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The CTI report states that the Lazarus group used a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine to create a covert channel for data exfiltration. It also mentions the use of a Trojanized VNC Uploader to upload data to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Archiving:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of utilities to archive the data before exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the Lazarus group used a custom tunneling tool to exfiltrate data through a covert channel.
   - There is no mention of archiving the data using utilities before exfiltration.
   - Given the focus on the custom tunneling tool and the lack of information about archiving, it is more likely that the data was exfiltrated directly through the covert channel without prior archiving.
