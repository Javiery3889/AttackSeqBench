### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The threat actors use spear-phishing emails and strategic Web compromises.
- These methods are designed to entice targets to open attachments containing the malicious Poison Ivy server code or redirect them to exploit-laden websites.

**Execution:**
- The Poison Ivy builder kit allows attackers to customize and build their own Poison Ivy server.
- The server is delivered as mobile code to a target that has been compromised, typically using social engineering.
- The server executes on the target's endpoint and connects to the attacker's client, giving them control of the system.

**Persistence:**
- If the 'persistence' option is enabled in Poison Ivy, a watchdog thread is injected into explorer.exe, which automatically restarts the Poison Ivy server process if it is unexpectedly terminated.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Poison Ivy's network communications are encrypted using the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key.
- The malware may blend in with normal network activity, especially when using port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

**Others:**
- The report details the use of Poison Ivy (PIVY), a RAT that remains popular and effective despite its age.
- FireEye has released Calamine, a set of tools to help detect and examine Poison Ivy infections.
- The report includes analysis of 194 Poison Ivy samples used in targeted attacks, extracting passwords, mutexes, and CnC infrastructure.
- It provides insights into the tools, tactics, and procedures of the attackers, exploring campaign connections and enabling defenders to better secure their networks.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After initiating execution of the Poison Ivy server by delivering it as mobile code via social engineering methods, is it likely that the malware will use Google Drive for Command and Control communications with the attacker's client during the Command and Control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails and strategic Web compromises.
2. **Execution:** Delivery of Poison Ivy server as mobile code via social engineering.
3. **Persistence:** Watchdog thread in explorer.exe to restart the Poison Ivy server.
4. **Defense Evasion:** Encrypted network communications using Camellia cipher and port 443 for SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

**Key Points from the Report:**
- Poison Ivy uses encrypted network communications, specifically the Camellia cipher with a 256-bit key.
- The malware often uses port 443 to blend in with normal SSL-encrypted Web traffic.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - There is no mention in the report of Poison Ivy using Google Drive for Command and Control (C2) communications.
  - The report emphasizes the use of encrypted network communications and port 443, which suggests a more traditional C2 method.
- **B: No**
  - This aligns with the information provided in the report. The report does not indicate that Poison Ivy uses Google Drive for C2 communications.
  - The use of encrypted network communications and port 443 is more consistent with the described behavior of Poison Ivy.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention Google Drive as a C2 method for Poison Ivy.
- The report emphasizes the use of encrypted network communications and port 443, which are more traditional and stealthy methods for C2.
- Given the detailed information about the malware's behavior, it is unlikely that Poison Ivy would use Google Drive for C2 communications.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
