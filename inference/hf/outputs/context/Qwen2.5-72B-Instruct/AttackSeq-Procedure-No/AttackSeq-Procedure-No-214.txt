### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself, and then removes the user.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **Others:** Attribution to Deep Panda and Winnti based on the use of Milestone backdoor and stolen certificates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to install a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher after ensuring persistence and before proceeding with system information discovery and screen capture functionalities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 in the registry.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the Milestone backdoor has capabilities for system information discovery and screen capture.
   - **Certificate Installation:** The report mentions the use of a stolen digital certificate, but it does not indicate that Deep Panda installs a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that Deep Panda installs a self-generated certificate to the local trust store as a root CA and Trusted Publisher. The use of a stolen certificate is mentioned, but this is different from generating and installing a new certificate.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report (persistence, discovery, and C2 communication) does not include the installation of a self-generated certificate.
