### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Shamoon malware was deployed and designed to overwrite data on disks.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver to facilitate disk access.
   - **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by entrenching itself as a service.
   - **Command and Control:** Fidelis researchers have developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware.
   - **Impact:** The malware overwrites data on disks, targeting user data first, then system data, and eventually the disk's boot records.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after overwriting the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic, the malware is likely to execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access during execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** Overwriting the VBR is a form of Defense Evasion, as it makes it harder for the system to boot and for forensic analysis to be conducted.
   - **Execution Sequence:** According to the report, the malware executes as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver to facilitate disk access.
   - **Order of Operations:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these operations, but it does indicate that the malware performs these actions during its execution phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the malware executes as a scheduled job and drops a driver to facilitate disk access. This is part of the execution phase, which occurs before the impact phase where the VBR is overwritten.
   - The question asks if the malware will execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access after overwriting the VBR. Given the sequence described in the report, the execution of the malware (including the scheduled job and driver drop) happens before the VBR is overwritten.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the malware will execute a copy of itself as a scheduled job and drop a driver for disk access after overwriting the VBR, as these actions are part of the initial execution phase.

### Final Answer
