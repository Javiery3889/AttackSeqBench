### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Strategic web compromise (SWC) on the VFW website.
- Exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) was used.
- Victims were infected with ZxShell malware.

**Others:**
- Another adversary leveraged the same vulnerability to target French aerospace.
- Malicious iframe redirected visitors to gifas[.]assso[.]net.
- Sakula malware was used in the French aerospace attack.
- The malware added domains to the "hosts" file of victim machines.
- No victim logs were discovered, but Safran's DNS was compromised.
- Similarities with a 2012 SWC campaign targeting Capstone Turbine:
  - Use of Sakula malware.
  - Use of GIFAS-based domains.
  - Use of zero-day exploits.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After AURORA PANDA leverages exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware during initial access through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organizationâ€™s website, is it likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Strategic web compromise (SWC) on the VFW website.
   - Exploit code for CVE-2014-0322.
   - Infection with ZxShell malware.

2. **Exploitation:**
   - No mention of Sakula malware in the VFW attack.
   - Sakula malware was used in the French aerospace attack, but it is not mentioned in the VFW attack.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the VFW attack used ZxShell malware, not Sakula malware.
- The French aerospace attack used Sakula malware, but this is a different attack by a different adversary.
- The question asks if it is likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a C2 infrastructure only before leveraging the exploit code in the VFW attack.
- Since the VFW attack did not use Sakula malware, it is not likely that Sakula malware would be used in this sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The VFW attack used ZxShell malware, not Sakula malware.
- The French aerospace attack used Sakula malware, but it is a different attack by a different adversary.
- The question specifically asks about the VFW attack, where Sakula malware was not used.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
