### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which then decrypt and execute the actual Machete malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks, use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating stored credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating processes, gathering browser data.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, staging data in a temporary folder, encrypting data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting data with AES, base64 encoding, compressing browser profile data, exfiltrating data to remote servers over the same C&C channel, scheduled transfers every 10 minutes, copying data to removable drives if a special file is present.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to multiply the first two octets of an IP address and add the third octet to that value to get a resulting command and control (C&C) port before exfiltrating the encrypted and compressed browser profile data via the same channel used for C&C.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Details from the Report:**
     - Data is encrypted with AES.
     - Data is sometimes base64 encoded.
     - Browser profile data is compressed as .zip files.
     - Data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C.
     - Scheduled transfers are set up to send data to the C&C server every 10 minutes.
     - Data from all drives can be copied to a removable drive if a special file is present.
   - **Question Details:**
     - The question introduces a specific method for determining the C&C port: multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet.
     - This method is not mentioned in the CTI report.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed description of the exfiltration process, including encryption, compression, and the use of the same C&C channel.
   - However, the report does not mention any specific method for determining the C&C port using the IP address octets.
   - Given the level of detail in the report, if such a method were used, it would likely have been included.
   - The absence of this specific method in the report suggests that it is not a part of Machete's known TTPs.
