### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using current events to lure victims.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used, with filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** Korplug establishes persistence by creating a hidden system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration via the same custom protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug collects system information such as uptime, Windows version, and CPU clock rate only after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Korplug establishes persistence by creating a hidden system directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, but it does not specify the exact timing of when this collection occurs relative to persistence.
   - **Control Flow:** The report emphasizes that the malware uses heavy control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques, suggesting that the collection of system information could occur at various stages of the attack, not necessarily only after persistence is established.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that the collection of system information (such as uptime, Windows version, and CPU clock rate) occurs only after persistence is established.
   - Given the heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and the iterative nature of the malware, it is plausible that the collection of system information could occur at multiple stages of the attack, including before persistence is established.
   - The primary focus of the report is on the overall attack sequence and the techniques used, rather than the exact timing of specific actions.
