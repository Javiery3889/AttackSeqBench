### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from other government-related entities. The attachments used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files used in the attack were weaponized using a variant of a tool named RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that was intended to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain. The loader used anti-sandboxing techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted and followed a specific format involving XORed TypeID and Data with a 256-byte key.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel. The communication protocol involved sending various types of data, including screenshots, files, and system information, back to the attackers through the established C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication after it shuts down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration and C&C Communication:** The CTI report clearly states that the backdoor is capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication. The communication protocol involves sending various types of data, including screenshots, files, and system information, back to the attackers.
   - **Shutting Down the Victim's Computer:** The question introduces a new scenario where the backdoor shuts down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability. This is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI report. However, the report does not rule out the possibility of such an action.
   - **Logical Sequence:** If the backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data and communicate with the C&C server, it is logical to assume that it would do so before or during the shutdown process to ensure that the collected data is sent to the attackers. Shutting down the computer would prevent further communication, so it is likely that the backdoor would attempt to exfiltrate data before the shutdown.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the logical sequence of events, it is likely that the backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication before or during the shutdown process.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
