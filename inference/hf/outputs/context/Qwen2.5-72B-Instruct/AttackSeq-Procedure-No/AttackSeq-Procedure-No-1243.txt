### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 uses a python script to generate random IPs and a database to centralize data.
     - Scan bots are geographically distributed across the United States, United Kingdom, and Bulgaria.
     - The bots probe potential victims and report back to a Django application for administration and reporting.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 employs spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents, phishing websites on typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits.
     - The first stage of the attack involves a dropper named runrun.exe, which drops and executes a file to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
   - **Execution:**
     - The second stage component, installed by a dropper named winloat.exe, writes key components to the disk along with a configuration file.
     - It takes control of the machine, deploying tools like a password dumper (run.exe), a privilege escalation tool (xp.exe), and a proxy tool (svehost.exe).
   - **Persistence:**
     - APT28 changes the timestamps of all files downloaded by the second stage dropper to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT28 uses a tool exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2014-4076) to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - APT28 deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on the mimikatz source.
   - **Collection:**
     - APT28 collects data using additional modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - APT28's C&C communication is via HTTP on port 443 or 80, sometimes encrypted using 3DES and RSA.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - APT28 exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process only before executing a dropper to enable system compromise.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 uses geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, APT28 executes a dropper (runrun.exe) to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The question specifically asks about the discovery process, but the CTI report does not explicitly mention a separate discovery phase where geographically distributed bots are used to report back to a central server. The discovery process is more integrated into the initial access and execution phases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that APT28 uses geographically distributed bots during the reconnaissance phase to identify and report vulnerable targets.
   - After gaining initial access through spear phishing, APT28 executes a dropper to contact the C&C server and download the second stage component.
   - The question asks if APT28 uses geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during the discovery process only before executing a dropper.
   - The CTI report does not support the idea of a separate discovery phase where geographically distributed bots are used to report back to a central server before executing a dropper.

### Final Answer: B: No
