### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and relies on scheduled tasks for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and moves laterally to systems with domain admins logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities, including SMB, named pipes, PsExec, and WinRM.
   - **Collection:** The adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online, file shares, and email.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will execute custom-built malware to exfiltrate processed files to cloud storage web services (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) only before collecting data from an information repository like Microsoft SharePoint Online during the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase in the CTI Report:**
     - The report mentions that the adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online.
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of custom-built malware for exfiltration to cloud storage web services.
     - The report does mention that the adversary exfiltrates data, but it does not specify the use of custom-built malware for this purpose.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report indicates that the adversary collects data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, and then exfiltrates it.
     - The report does not suggest a specific sequence where custom-built malware is used only before collecting data from SharePoint Online.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide evidence that the adversary uses custom-built malware for exfiltration to cloud storage web services.
   - The report indicates that the adversary collects data from various sources, including SharePoint Online, but does not specify a sequence where custom-built malware is used only before this collection.
   - The use of Cobalt Strike for exfiltration is mentioned, but not the use of custom-built malware.
