### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - WinDealer executes by reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - It loads a DLL module into memory.
     - The malware steals information from the victim's PC, including network configuration and SNS application details.
     - Stolen data is saved with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files are encoded using XOR with the key "b6a7%7486".
     - Communication with C2 servers is encrypted, with an AES key encrypted using RSA.
     - Stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - It processes and stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Collection:**
     - The malware collects data from the victim's PC, including files from USB memory, documents, desktop items, and recycle bin contents.
     - It also targets folders related to SNS applications.
     - Collected data is processed into ".a" files and categorized into different directories based on the data type.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The malware exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that WinDealer will process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the `%TEMP%` directory during the exfiltration phase, after communicating with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The report states that WinDealer communicates with C2 servers using encrypted channels, specifically encrypting an AES key with RSA and sending it to the C2 server.
   - **Processing and Encrypting Stolen Data:**
     - The report mentions that the malware processes and stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
     - The stolen data is saved with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The malware exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that WinDealer processes and encrypts stolen data as ".a" files in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - This processing and encryption occur before the data is exfiltrated to the C2 server.
   - The communication with C2 servers using an AES key encrypted with RSA is part of the command and control activities, which precede the exfiltration phase.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that after communicating with C2 servers, WinDealer will process and encrypt stolen data as ".a" files in the `%TEMP%` directory during the exfiltration phase.
