### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**: The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update.
- **Initial Access**: The initial compromise involved a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript, leading to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe.
- **Execution**: Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
- **Defense Evasion**: PsExec was used to disable Windows Defender and stop services.
- **Credential Access**: Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and log file deletion.
- **Discovery**: The attackers used commands like whoami, net user, net group, and Get-NetComputer to profile the computer and search for Active Directory objects.
- **Lateral Movement**: Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for lateral movement.
- **Command and Control**: The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After the WastedLocker ransomware is deployed using PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender during the Defense Evasion phase, is it likely that the ransomware will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Defense Evasion**: The report mentions that the attackers used PsExec to disable Windows Defender and stop services. This is a crucial step to ensure the ransomware can operate without interference.
- **Impact**: The report does not explicitly state that the attackers deleted system volume shadow copies. However, it is a common tactic in ransomware attacks to delete volume shadow copies to prevent data recovery. This is often done using PowerShell commands.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The report details the use of PsExec to stop services and disable Windows Defender, which are typical steps in the Defense Evasion phase.
  - While the report does not explicitly mention the deletion of system volume shadow copies, it is a common practice in ransomware attacks to prevent victims from recovering data.
  - Given the sophistication of the attackers and the thorough nature of their attack, it is highly likely that they would take additional steps to ensure the ransomware's effectiveness, including deleting system volume shadow copies.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Based on the common practices in ransomware attacks and the sophisticated nature of the WastedLocker attack, it is likely that the ransomware would delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands in the Impact phase.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
