### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and custom droppers like LATCHKEY and DRAWSTRING.
   - **Credential Access:** Process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Collection:** Data from network shared drives, staged locally or remotely, and archived.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services before leveraging native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance during discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. However, it does mention the use of web shells and custom malware for various purposes, including command execution and data exfiltration.
   - **Discovery:** The report clearly states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Sequence:** The question suggests a specific sequence where lateral movement via remote services (using Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE) occurs before internal reconnaissance. The report does not provide a clear sequence of these actions, but it does indicate that internal reconnaissance is a critical step in their operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement Tools:** The report does not explicitly mention Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE. However, it does mention the use of web shells and custom malware for various purposes, which could include lateral movement.
   - **Discovery Tools:** The report clearly states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not provide a clear sequence of lateral movement followed by discovery. However, it is logical to assume that internal reconnaissance (discovery) is a necessary step before lateral movement to understand the network topology and identify targets for movement.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report, it is not explicitly stated that FIN13 uses Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement before internal reconnaissance. The report emphasizes the use of web shells and custom malware for various purposes, including command execution and data exfiltration, but does not provide a clear sequence of lateral movement followed by discovery.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
