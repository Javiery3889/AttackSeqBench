### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Key Details:**
- **Command and Control:**
  - MuddyWater uses compromised servers to host malicious code for the second stage of attacks.
  - Servers are located in countries they target, such as Pakistan and China.
  - A RAT file communicates with the IP address 185.244.149[.]218, sending encoded base64 output about processes running on the compromised system.

- **Others:**
  - MuddyWater impersonates entities in countries surrounding Iran.
  - They use documents resembling official documents from the regional government of Kurdistan and unofficial documents from countries surrounding Iran.
  - The attack vector leverages CVE-2017-0199 to download a JPG file containing a malicious macro.
  - Documents are categorized into two groups: those resembling previous documents used by MuddyWater and those written in English.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After MuddyWater leverages a Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) to gain initial access to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector, is it likely that they will only then utilize command and control servers in Pakistan and China to host malicious code and communicate with compromised systems?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - MuddyWater uses CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access.
   - They send requests to a hacked server to download a JPG file containing a malicious macro.

2. **Command and Control:**
   - Compromised servers in Pakistan and China are used to host malicious code.
   - A RAT file communicates with the IP address 185.244.149[.]218, sending encoded base64 output about processes running on the compromised system.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that MuddyWater uses CVE-2017-0199 to gain initial access and then uses compromised servers in Pakistan and China for command and control.
- The report does not suggest that MuddyWater only uses these servers after gaining initial access; rather, it implies that these servers are part of the overall attack infrastructure.

**Answer Choice A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that MuddyWater will only use command and control servers in Pakistan and China after gaining initial access.
- This is not entirely accurate because the report indicates that these servers are part of the broader attack infrastructure and are used for hosting malicious code and communication, not just after initial access.

**Answer Choice B: No**
- This choice suggests that MuddyWater does not only use command and control servers in Pakistan and China after gaining initial access.
- This aligns with the report, which indicates that these servers are part of the overall attack infrastructure and are used for various stages of the attack, including hosting malicious code and communication.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
