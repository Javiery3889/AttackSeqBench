### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment:** The attack began with a well-crafted email containing an Excel document that appeared legitimate.

**Execution:**
- **T1204 - User Execution:** The Excel document contained a hidden object exploiting CVE-2017-11882, allowing silent code execution.

**Defense Evasion:**
- **T1107 - File Deletion:** The original file was deleted after infection.
- **T1158 - Hidden Files and Directories:** Files and directories were hidden.
- **T1045 - Software Packing:** The threat came packed/encrypted.

**Collection:**
- **T1005 - Data from Local System:** The malware collected data from the local system.

**Command and Control:**
- **T1043 - Commonly Used Port:** The stolen credentials were sent to a command and control server using common ports.
- **T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol:** The communication used standard application layer protocols.

**Exfiltration:**
- **T1002 - Data Encrypted:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated.

**Others:**
- The attack is attributed to SWEED, which targets precision engineering companies in Italy.
- The malware includes a dropped PE file and a malicious document with specific hashes.
- The dropping URL is http[://mail.hajj.zeem.sa/wp-admin/edu/educrety.exe.
- The attack involved a Microsoft Office exploit and the implementation of LokiBot.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the malware collected data from the local system, is it likely that educrety.exe used NirSoft tools to steal user credentials from the infected machine before exfiltrating the encrypted data to the command and control server?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
- The data was exfiltrated to a command and control server (T1043, T1071).
- The data was encrypted before exfiltration (T1002).

**Contextual Information:**
- The attack involved the use of a Microsoft Office exploit and the implementation of LokiBot.
- The dropping URL is http[://mail.hajj.zeem.sa/wp-admin/edu/educrety.exe.

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of NirSoft tools.
- However, LokiBot is known for its capability to steal credentials and other sensitive information.
- The use of NirSoft tools is a common technique for credential theft, but it is not mentioned in the report.

**Reasoning:**
- While it is possible that NirSoft tools were used, the report does not provide direct evidence to support this.
- The report focuses on the use of LokiBot, which is a known credential stealer, making it more likely that LokiBot itself was used to steal credentials rather than NirSoft tools.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**

The report does not provide evidence that NirSoft tools were used to steal user credentials. The focus is on the use of LokiBot, which is a known credential stealer, making it more likely that LokiBot itself was responsible for the credential theft.
