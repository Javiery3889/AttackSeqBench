### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
- Designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Execution:**
- Opening the malicious Word document triggers a VBS macro.
- The macro calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
- The PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
- Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
- Leverages the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk.

**Command and Control:**
- The PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers.
- Uses DownloadString and DownloadData methods to contact and download from C2 servers.

**Impact:**
- GandCrab ransomware (version 5.0.4) encrypts files.
- Ursnif malware performs credential harvesting, gathers system and process information, and potentially deploys additional malware.

**Others:**
- Campaign analyzed using VirusTotal Graph.
- At least three different variants of Ursnif hosted on bevendbrec[.]com.
- PowerShell cradle and PS Empire script used to inject GandCrab into memory.
- New samples discovered daily.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack starts with phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
- The Word document contains a VBS macro that triggers an encoded PowerShell script.
- The PowerShell script downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- The script operates in memory and uses various techniques to avoid detection.
- The script communicates with C2 servers to download and execute payloads.

**Context of CVE-2018-13379:**
- CVE-2018-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability in FortiOS devices.
- This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the device, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not mention any exploitation of network devices or specific vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379.
- The focus of the attack is on initial access through phishing emails and the subsequent execution of malware.
- The attack sequence described in the report is centered around social engineering and fileless techniques to avoid detection and execute malware.
- There is no indication that the attackers are targeting or exploiting network devices like FortiOS.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the attack sequence starting with phishing emails and leading to the execution of Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- The report does not mention any exploitation of network devices or specific vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-13379.
- The focus of the attack is on initial access and the use of fileless techniques to avoid detection.
- Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the campaign would exploit CVE-2018-13379 in FortiOS devices after gaining initial access through phishing emails.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
