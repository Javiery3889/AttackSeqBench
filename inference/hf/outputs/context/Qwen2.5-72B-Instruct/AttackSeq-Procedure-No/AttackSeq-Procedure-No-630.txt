### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
     - SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
     - Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed through various methods.
     - 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
     - 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).
     - PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection) injected the final payload DLL into memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
     - Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.
   - **Collection:**
     - SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
     - C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
     - RSA encryption for AES key exchange.
     - Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT malware will identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host before archiving collected data using a custom storage file format.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the CostaRicto Campaign used process injection and deobfuscation to evade defenses.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report states that the SombRicto Campaign's SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Anti-Virus Identification:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention that the SombRAT malware identifies the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report focuses on the techniques used for initial access, execution, defense evasion, and data collection.
   - While the report mentions defense evasion techniques such as process injection and deobfuscation, it does not provide any information about the malware identifying the installed anti-virus product.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report does not include a step where the malware identifies the anti-virus product before archiving data.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
