### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Higaisa APT group distributed malicious LNK files within RAR archives via spear-phishing.
- The LNK files were disguised as a Curriculum Vitae, IELTS exam results, or targeted product teams using zeplin.io.

**Execution:**
- Upon execution, the LNK file initiates a multi-stage attack involving several commands:
  - Copying the LNK content to a temporary directory.
  - Using 'certutil.exe' renamed to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection.
  - Decoding a base64 blob.
  - Decompressing content along with a decoy PDF document.
  - Executing a JavaScript file.
- The JavaScript file performs additional actions:
  - Creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe'.
  - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
  - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack employs a list of commands executed by the LNK shortcut, similar to those reported in the Higasia Covid-19 campaign.
- 'certutil.exe' is renamed to 'gosia.exe' to bypass security detection.

**Discovery:**
- The JavaScript file creates 'd3reEW.exe' with the command 'cmd /c ipconfig' to discover IP address information.

**Command and Control:**
- The final shellcode within the attack resolves imports, allocates memory, and creates a thread to make HTTPS requests to a C&C server.
- The server was down at the time of analysis, preventing clear identification of the ultimate goal of the attack.

**Others:**
- The Higaisa APT group's activities date back to at least 2016.
- They use Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware.
- Their targets include government officials, human rights organizations, and other entities related to North Korea.
- Malwarebytes Labs identified the attack on May 29th and stopped the LNK file execution using the Nebula business version of their software.
- The attack was first disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Higaisa APT group uses the LNK file to initiate multi-stage commands, including executing a JavaScript file as part of the attack's execution phase, is it likely the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory to maintain persistence only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Distribution of malicious LNK files via spear-phishing.
2. **Execution:**
   - Copying LNK content to a temporary directory.
   - Using 'certutil.exe' (renamed to 'gosia.exe') to bypass security detection.
   - Decoding a base64 blob.
   - Decompressing content along with a decoy PDF document.
   - Executing a JavaScript file.
   - Creating and executing 'd3reEW.exe'.
   - Copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory.
   - Sending a POST request to a hardcoded URL.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Renaming 'certutil.exe' to 'gosia.exe'.
4. **Discovery:** Creating 'd3reEW.exe' with 'cmd /c ipconfig'.
5. **Command and Control:** Making HTTPS requests to a C&C server.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.
- The CTI report does not mention 'officeupdate.exe' or any scheduled tasks.
- The report clearly states that the JavaScript file copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as part of the execution phase.

**Evaluation:**
- The sequence described in the question (adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks before copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory) is not supported by the CTI report.
- The report only mentions copying 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as part of the execution phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention 'officeupdate.exe' or any scheduled tasks.
- The report clearly states that the JavaScript file copies 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory as part of the execution phase.
- Therefore, it is not likely that the JavaScript file will copy 'svchhast.exe' to the startup directory only after adding 'officeupdate.exe' to scheduled tasks.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
