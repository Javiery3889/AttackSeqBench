### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org).
     - They developed capabilities including malware (Graphite malware) and tools (Empire).
     - These resources were used to support the operation, with domains purchased to serve as command and control servers, malicious components built to conduct the attack, and red teaming tools employed.
   - **Execution:**
     - The adversaries exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution.
     - They abused PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for the execution of the Empire stager.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The adversaries established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
     - They also created a local account (net user /add user1) to maintain access to victim systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The adversaries used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel (use of different Empire stagers).
     - They used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.
     - They employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversaries acquired domains such as wordkeyvpload[.]net and tools like Empire only after exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2021-40444) through spear phishing emails to gain initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers acquired infrastructure and developed capabilities before the attack. This includes acquiring domains and developing tools like Empire.
   - **Execution:**
     - The exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 and the use of Empire PowerShell stager for execution are part of the execution phase, which comes after the resource development phase.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The logical sequence of events is:
       1. Resource Development: Acquire domains and tools.
       2. Execution: Exploit vulnerability and use tools.
       3. Persistence: Establish persistence mechanisms.
       4. Defense Evasion: Conceal malicious activities.
       5. Command and Control: Set up communication channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the acquisition of domains and tools (Empire) was part of the resource development phase, which is a preparatory step before the actual attack.
   - The exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 and the use of Empire PowerShell stager are part of the execution phase, which occurs after the resources are already in place.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the adversaries acquired the domains and tools only after gaining initial access through the vulnerability.

### Final Answer: B: No
