### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe were used for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened malicious documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using sc.exe and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders and removed from the file system.
     - rundll32.exe was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally on the network.
     - A data encryption algorithm was used to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware used HTTP to connect to C2 servers disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group leveraged compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement across the network only before using net user and SMBMap for network share discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that system utilities like ipconfig.exe and ping.exe were used for reconnaissance.
     - Initial access was gained through malicious documents with job offers.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - **Network Share Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of net user and SMBMap for network share discovery. However, it does mention the use of system utilities and net.exe for reconnaissance, which could include network share discovery.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report does not provide a strict sequence of actions, but it does indicate that the group used compromised accounts for lateral movement and system utilities for reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms the use of compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - The report mentions the use of system utilities for reconnaissance, which could include network share discovery, but it does not specifically mention net user and SMBMap.
   - The question asks if the group used compromised accounts for lateral movement **only** before using net user and SMBMap. The report does not provide enough information to confirm this specific sequence.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report, it is not likely that the Lazarus Group leveraged compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement across the network **only** before using net user and SMBMap for network share discovery. The report does not provide a strict sequence of actions and does not specifically mention the use of net user and SMBMap.

**Final Answer: B: No**
