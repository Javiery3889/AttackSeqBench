### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign targeted various sectors and used infrastructure for reconnaissance and potential deployment of destructive malware.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.
   - **Execution:** Used tools like Putty, Plink, and a VBScript to download and unify hex-encoded file chunks.
   - **Persistence:** Created local admin users and manipulated accessibility tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used JuicyPotato, ProcDump, and Mimikatz to escalate privileges and steal credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed tools rarely detected by antivirus and techniques to avoid VM environments.
   - **Credential Access:** Used Procdump and Mimikatz to dump credentials and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Discovery:** Developed 'STSRCheck' for network mapping and used 'PORT.EXE' for port scanning.
   - **Command and Control:** Used self-developed backdoors and public tools for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Manually selected and exfiltrated valuable data using WinRAR or 7-zip.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Fox Kitten Campaign is likely to use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network for lateral movement after achieving credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms the use of Procdump and Mimikatz for credential extraction and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. However, it does describe the use of various tools and techniques for maintaining access and moving laterally within the network.
   - **Tools and Techniques:** The campaign used a combination of self-developed tools and legitimate tools repurposed for malicious use. The report mentions RDP over SSH tunneling, socket-based backdoors, and public tools like Ngrok, Serveo, and FRP for lateral movement and command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Fox Kitten Campaign is known for using a variety of tools and techniques to maintain access and move laterally within the network.
   - While the report does not specifically mention PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker, it is plausible that the attackers could use any available tool to achieve their objectives, especially if it fits their operational needs.
   - However, the report does not provide any evidence or indication that PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker were part of their toolkit.

### Final Answer
Given the lack of specific evidence in the CTI report supporting the use of PDQ Deploy and AvosLocker, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
