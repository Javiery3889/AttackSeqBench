### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will steal application access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links before collecting system information and probing files as part of the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that FamousSparrow gained initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications, not through phishing emails.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - **Phishing Emails:** There is no mention of phishing emails or stealing application access tokens in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not indicate that FamousSparrow used phishing emails to steal application access tokens.
   - The initial access method described is through exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - The Discovery phase activities, such as collecting system information and probing files, are consistent with the report.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that FamousSparrow will use phishing emails containing malicious links before the Discovery phase activities described in the report.
