### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2014-4148 embedded in a Word document, to compromise targets.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and includes detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities.
   - **Collection:** The malware has extensive remote control capabilities and can be customized with additional plugins and modules for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Longhorn configures specific domains and IP addresses for C2 servers, using privacy services and HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that Longhorn uses zero-day exploits embedded in Word documents to gain initial access.
   - **Discovery and Collection:** The report states that Longhorn's malware is built for espionage and includes detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities. This aligns with the question's mention of system fingerprinting and discovery.
   - **Command and Control and Exfiltration:** The report also mentions that Longhorn uses specific C2 configurations and exfiltration techniques to avoid detection, which aligns with the question's mention of following guidelines to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn gains access using a zero-day exploit in a Word document.
   - **Discovery and Collection:** Once access is gained, the malware performs system fingerprinting and discovery to gather detailed information about the target.
   - **Command and Control and Exfiltration:** After gathering information, the malware communicates with C2 servers and exfiltrates data while following operational security measures to avoid detection.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI report, it is clear that Longhorn's tools perform system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware before following guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
