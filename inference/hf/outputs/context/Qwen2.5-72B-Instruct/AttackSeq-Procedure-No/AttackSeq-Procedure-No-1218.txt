### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. It used a multi-stage execution process involving shellcode and a temporary file.
   - **Execution:** The malware used a legitimate Microsoft executable (igfxtray.exe) to sideload a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll), which performed security product checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry key modifications and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware evaded detection by customizing its installation to avoid 24 security products and using multi-stage checks.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captured data about the infected system, stole files from removable media, and targeted Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to exfiltrate collected data using the MIME protocol after the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that T9000 captures data about the infected system, steals files from removable media, and targets Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** The report specifies that T9000 communicates with the C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic. It does not mention the use of the MIME protocol for exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that T9000 uses a binary protocol for C2 communication, which is different from the MIME protocol.
   - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is typically used for email and web protocols, not for binary data exfiltration in malware.
   - Given the detailed description of the binary protocol used for C2 communication, it is highly unlikely that T9000 would switch to using the MIME protocol for exfiltration.
