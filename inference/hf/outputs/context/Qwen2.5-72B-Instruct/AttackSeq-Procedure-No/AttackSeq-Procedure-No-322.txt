### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the app collects information such as text messages, contact lists, geo-location data, and performs routines on the iOS device, is it likely to use encryption for its C2 channel before uploading files via FTP protocol?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware is advanced and designed to run on iOS devices.
- It collects a wide range of sensitive information.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of encryption for the C2 channel or the method of file transfer.

**Contextual Analysis:**
- Advanced malware often uses encryption to protect its C2 communications and data exfiltration to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.
- FTP is a common protocol for file transfer, but it is not secure by default (it does not use encryption).
- Given the advanced nature of the malware and the sensitive information it collects, it is likely that the threat actors would use encryption to secure the C2 channel and data exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The malware is described as advanced and similar to SEDNIT, which is known for its sophisticated capabilities.
2. The malware collects a wide range of sensitive information, which would be valuable to the threat actors.
3. Advanced threat actors typically use encryption to protect their C2 communications and data exfiltration to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.
4. While the report does not explicitly state the use of encryption, the advanced nature of the malware and the sensitive information it collects strongly suggest that encryption would be used.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
