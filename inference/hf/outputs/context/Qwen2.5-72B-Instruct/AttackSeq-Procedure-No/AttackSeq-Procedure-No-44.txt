### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which then decrypt and execute the actual Machete malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, producing file listings, and enumerating processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication and exfiltration, with fallback to HTTP if FTP is unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete is likely to divide files if the size is 0x1000000 bytes (16 MB) or more before exfiltrating them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report mentions that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs are encrypted.
   - The report does not explicitly state whether Machete divides files if they exceed a certain size before exfiltration.
   - However, it is common for malware to implement file division or chunking to avoid detection and ensure successful exfiltration, especially for large files. This is because large files can be more easily detected by network monitoring tools and can cause issues with transmission over certain protocols.
   - The use of FTP and HTTP for exfiltration suggests that Machete is designed to handle various file sizes and network conditions. Dividing large files into smaller chunks can help ensure that the exfiltration process is more reliable and less likely to be interrupted or detected.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Clipboard Contents and Screenshots:** These are typically small in size and do not require division.
   - **Staging Data in a Temporary Folder:** The report mentions that data is encrypted and staged, but it does not specify the size of the files.
   - **Exfiltration Methods:** The use of FTP and HTTP for exfiltration implies that Machete is designed to handle various file sizes. Large files can be problematic for these protocols, so dividing them would be a logical step to ensure successful exfiltration.
   - **Common Malware Practices:** Many advanced malware families, including those that use FTP and HTTP for exfiltration, often implement file division to avoid detection and ensure reliability.

### Final Answer
Given the common practices in malware and the need to ensure successful exfiltration, it is likely that Machete would divide files if they exceed 16 MB before exfiltrating them.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
