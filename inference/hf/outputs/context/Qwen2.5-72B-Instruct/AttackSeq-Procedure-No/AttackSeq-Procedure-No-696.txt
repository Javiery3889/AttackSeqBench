### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with the distribution of targeted emails containing malicious document files. These emails use the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure to entice victims to open the attachments. The document files use a template injection technique to load a document template from the internet, which contains malicious macro codes.
   - **Persistence:** The VBS script registers a RUN key in the Windows registry to ensure its execution at every system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The VBS script employs obfuscation techniques and deletes itself after execution to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control:** The VBS script communicates with a C&C server located at a specific URL.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Gamaredon group will use the native `at` Windows task scheduler tool to schedule and execute a task before achieving persistence by registering a RUN key in the Windows registry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through malicious document files with macro codes.
   - **Persistence:** The report specifies that the VBS script registers a RUN key in the Windows registry to ensure persistence.
   - **Task Scheduling:** The report does not mention the use of the `at` Windows task scheduler tool. The persistence mechanism described is the registration of a RUN key, which is a common and effective method for ensuring that the script runs at every system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The VBS script uses obfuscation and self-deletion to evade detection, but there is no indication of using the `at` task scheduler for this purpose.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a clear and detailed sequence of the attack, focusing on the use of malicious documents, macro codes, and the registration of a RUN key for persistence.
   - The use of the `at` task scheduler is not mentioned in the report, and it is not a common or necessary step for achieving persistence in this context.
   - Given the focus on the RUN key for persistence and the absence of any mention of the `at` task scheduler, it is unlikely that the group would use the `at` tool before registering the RUN key.
