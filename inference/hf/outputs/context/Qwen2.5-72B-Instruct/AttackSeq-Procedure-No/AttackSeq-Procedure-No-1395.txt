### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT and passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used for command execution and file operations.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT are used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are used for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities are used for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass are used to obtain credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware are used for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR are used for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols are used for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** Web shells and JSP tools are used to exfiltrate data for fraudulent transactions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to leverage WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally within victim networks after collecting data from network shared drives and staging it for eventual fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The CTI report explicitly states that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement. They employ utilities like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for this purpose.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data using web shells and JSP tools, which aligns with the scenario of collecting data from network shared drives and staging it for exfiltration.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described in the question (collecting data, staging it, and then moving laterally) is consistent with the tactics used by FIN13. After collecting and staging data, it is logical for the threat actor to move laterally to other parts of the network to further their objectives.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection and Staging:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Given that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement, it is highly likely that they would leverage WMI to remotely execute commands and move laterally within the victim network after staging the data.
   - **Consistency with TTPs:** The use of WMI for lateral movement is a well-documented technique in the CTI report, making it a plausible next step in the attack sequence.
