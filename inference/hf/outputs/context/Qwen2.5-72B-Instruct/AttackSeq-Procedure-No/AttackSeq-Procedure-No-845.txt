### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Methods:**
  - Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros
  - RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading
- **RAR File Names:** In Vietnamese, indicating primary targets are in Vietnam or Vietnamese-speaking individuals

**Defense Evasion:**
- **VBS Decode Function:** Reused from Motobit to decode base64 blobs
- **DLL Dropping:** KerrDown DLL is dropped in 'Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\' as 'main_background.png'
- **Payload Retrieval:** The DLL retrieves the payload from a URL, decrypts it using DES, and executes it in memory
- **Memory Execution:** Only the KerrDown DLL is saved on the system, and the payload is executed directly in memory

**Command and Control:**
- **Final Payload:** A variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon
- **URL Download:** The KerrDown downloader attempts to download the payload from a URL based on the victim's OS architecture

**Others:**
- **Compile Timestamps:** Suggest active use since March 2018
- **Working Hours:** 9 AM to 6 PM GMT+7, indicating operations likely from Vietnam or nearby countries
- **Target Base:** Broader geographic and industry-wide targets

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- **Context:** After delivering KerrDown to targets via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading
- **Query:** Is it likely that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Initial Access:** The attack uses both Office documents with macros and RAR archives with DLL side-loading.
- **Defense Evasion:** The VBS decode function is used to decode base64 blobs, and the DLL is dropped as an image file.
- **Payload Execution:** The payload is retrieved from a URL and executed in memory based on the victim's OS architecture.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the Office document will use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture and contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
  - The report mentions the use of base64 blobs and the execution of the payload based on the victim's OS architecture, but it does not specify that the Office document itself contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that the Office document will not use base64 blobs to execute the payload based on the victim's system architecture only before containing an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
  - The report does not indicate that the Office document contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros. Instead, it focuses on the use of base64 blobs and the execution of the payload in memory.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the VBS decode function is used to decode base64 blobs, and the payload is executed in memory based on the victim's OS architecture.
- However, the report does not mention that the Office document itself contains an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.
- The image file 'main_background.png' is dropped by the DLL, not by the Office document.

**Final Answer: B: No**
