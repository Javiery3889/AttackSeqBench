### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Reconnaissance**:
  - Use of masscan to identify potential entry points by extracting IP ranges associated with medical-related keywords.
  - Use of specialized search engines like Shodan and Censys to find publicly available resources.
  - Discovery of non-trivial ports and services, such as Building Management systems using the Niagara Fox protocol and printers with web interfaces without authentication.

- **Others**:
  - Overview of threats affecting medical networks, including malware on servers and computers.
  - Targeting of pharmaceutical organizations by APT actors using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
  - Recommendations for mitigating threats.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After conducting reconnaissance on medical infrastructure using tools like masscan and identifying Building Management systems with Niagara Fox protocol and unauthenticated printer web interfaces, is it likely that metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings will be retrieved during the discovery phase?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Reconnaissance Phase**:
  - The report describes the use of masscan and specialized search engines to identify potential entry points and non-trivial services.
  - The focus is on identifying IP ranges, ports, and services that can be exploited.

- **Discovery Phase**:
  - The discovery phase typically involves gathering more detailed information about the identified targets.
  - Given the identification of Building Management systems and unauthenticated printer web interfaces, it is plausible that the attackers would attempt to gather more detailed information about these systems.

- **Metadata and File Listings**:
  - The report does not explicitly mention the retrieval of metadata for files on disk or file and directory listings.
  - However, the discovery of unauthenticated printer web interfaces suggests that these interfaces could be exploited to retrieve such information.
  - Printers with web interfaces often provide access to file listings and metadata, especially if they are not properly secured.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The reconnaissance phase has identified unauthenticated printer web interfaces.
  - These interfaces are likely to provide access to file listings and metadata.
  - The discovery phase would logically involve exploiting these interfaces to gather more detailed information.

- **Final Answer**:
  - Final Answer: A: Yes
