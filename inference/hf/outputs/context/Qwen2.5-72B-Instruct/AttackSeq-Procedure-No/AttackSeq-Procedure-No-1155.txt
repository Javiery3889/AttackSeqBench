### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers targeted Instagram users, particularly influencers.
- They impersonated technical support or friends of the victims.
- They used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages.
- These messages contained generic greetings and claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges.
- The messages lured victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface.

**Credential Access:**
- The attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.
- After obtaining these details, they changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners.
- They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access and Credential Access:**
  - The report clearly states that the attackers used phishing sites to collect credentials and then changed the passwords to lock out the original owners.
  - The report does not mention any ransom demands or a sequence where the attackers collect credentials after demanding ransom payments.

- **Sequence of Events:**
  - The sequence described in the report is:
    1. Initial Access: Phishing messages to lure victims.
    2. Credential Access: Collecting credentials through phishing sites.
    3. Account Compromise: Changing passwords and locking out original owners.
    4. Data Exfiltration: Downloading images and messages.

- **Ransom Demands:**
  - The report does not indicate any ransom demands or a sequence where the attackers collect credentials after demanding ransom payments. The focus is on the initial access and credential access phases.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The report clearly outlines the sequence of events where the attackers use phishing to gain initial access, collect credentials, and then lock out the original owners by changing passwords.
- There is no mention of ransom demands or a sequence where the attackers collect credentials after demanding ransom payments.
- Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers will collect victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites only after demanding ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts.

**Final Answer: B: No**
