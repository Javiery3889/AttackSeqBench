### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture.
- Use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, and social media data collection.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.
- Install BlackEnergy 3 (BE3) on targeted electricity distributors after employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.

**Command and Control:**
- Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to attacker-controlled Command and Control (C2) servers.
- This connection is established as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods, is it likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers only before being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance:**
- The report clearly states that adversaries gather information and conduct active discovery methods before the attack.

**Initial Access:**
- The report indicates that adversaries send targeted emails containing weaponized MS Office files.
- Employees must open these attachments and enable macros for the malware to be installed.

**Command and Control:**
- The report states that the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server after the malicious files are installed and the macros are executed.

**Sequence of Events:**
1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information and conducting active discovery.
2. **Initial Access:** Phishing campaign and employee-enabled macro execution.
3. **Command and Control:** Malware establishes a connection to the C2 server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that the malware (BlackEnergy 3) establishes a connection to the C2 server after it is installed on the network.
- The installation of the malware is dependent on employees opening the weaponized attachments and enabling macros.
- Therefore, the malware does not establish communication with the C2 server before being installed on the network.

**Final Answer:**
- B: No
