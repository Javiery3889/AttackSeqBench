### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Stuxnet used the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:** The worm executed malicious code, including kernel-mode drivers and user-mode components, to perform various tasks.
   - **Persistence:** Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers and modified system files and registry keys to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stuxnet used MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The worm used rootkit functionality and stolen digital certificates to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Stuxnet exploited the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities to spread laterally through the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Stuxnet is likely to exploit the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement after communicating with its C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C&C Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the sequence of events after C&C communication. However, it is common for malware to perform additional actions after communicating with C&C servers, such as receiving new commands or updates.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report clearly states that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement. This is a key part of the worm's propagation strategy.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Stuxnet's primary goal is to spread and maintain control over infected systems, it is highly likely that after communicating with its C&C servers, it would continue to exploit known vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - The C&C communication phase is often used to receive new instructions or updates, which could include commands to spread further within the network.
   - The report explicitly mentions that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement, which aligns with the question's scenario.
