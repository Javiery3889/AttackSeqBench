### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from other government-related entities. The attachments used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files used in the attack were weaponized using a variant of a tool named RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that was intended to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers employed anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques throughout the infection chain. The loader used anti-sandboxing techniques and gathered data on the victim's computer, which was then encrypted and sent to the C&C server.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted and followed a specific format involving XORed TypeID and Data with a 256-byte key.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel. The communication protocol involved sending various types of data, including screenshots, files, and system information, back to the attackers through the established C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will deploy CaddyWiper to wipe files related to OT capabilities and physical drive partitions after exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Context of the Attack:** The CTI report describes a sophisticated surveillance operation targeting a Southeast Asian government. The primary objectives of the attackers were to gain initial access, establish persistence, gather detailed information, and exfiltrate data.
   - **CaddyWiper:** CaddyWiper is a destructive malware known for wiping files and physical drive partitions, typically used in targeted attacks to cause significant damage to the victim's systems. It is often associated with attacks on critical infrastructure and operational technology (OT) systems.
   - **Attack Objectives:** The CTI report does not mention any destructive actions or the use of CaddyWiper. The focus of the attack was on surveillance and data exfiltration, not on causing physical damage to the systems.
   - **Threat Actor Behavior:** The report attributes the operation to a Chinese APT group that has been refining its tools for at least 3 years. The group's activities are described as focused on surveillance and data collection, not on destructive actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly outlines the objectives of the attack, which are to gain access, establish persistence, gather information, and exfiltrate data.
   - There is no mention of any destructive actions or the use of CaddyWiper in the report.
   - The threat actor's behavior and the nature of the attack suggest that the primary goal was surveillance and data theft, not system destruction.
   - Deploying CaddyWiper would be inconsistent with the described objectives and the behavior of the threat actor.

### Final Answer: B: No
