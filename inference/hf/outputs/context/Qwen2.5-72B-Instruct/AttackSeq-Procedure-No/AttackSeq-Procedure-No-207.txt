### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained initial access through the Log4Shell vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** Executed PowerShell scripts and a batch file to download and run additional files, including syn.exe and 1.dll (Milestone backdoor).
   - **Persistence:** Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself with CreateProcessAsUser, and then removes the user.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server uncompressed.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.
   - **Others:** Attribution to Deep Panda and Winnti based on the use of Milestone backdoor and Fire Chili rootkit.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Deep Panda is likely to gain persistence through the Milestone backdoor by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry, after using the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Fire Chili Rootkit:** The report mentions that the Fire Chili rootkit is used for defense evasion, specifically employing Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to protect malicious artifacts.
   - **Persistence Mechanism:** The report clearly states that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion does not contradict the persistence mechanism described in the report.
   - The persistence mechanism of the Milestone backdoor is explicitly detailed in the report, confirming that it copies itself to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creates a service named msupdate2 directly in the registry.
   - Therefore, the sequence of using the Fire Chili rootkit for defense evasion followed by gaining persistence through the Milestone backdoor is consistent with the information provided in the CTI report.
