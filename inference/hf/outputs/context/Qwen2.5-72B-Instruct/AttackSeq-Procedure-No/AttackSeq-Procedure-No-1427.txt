### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access is through a malicious installer (20SPEED-VPN-v9.2.exe) that places spyware components in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps directory and launches sysCrt32.exe.
   - **Execution:** sysCrt32.exe ensures persistence, adds the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable, and sets up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours. sysBus32.exe downloads and executes the second stage from the C2 server. Other executables like libCache32.exe, libTemp32.exe, and libchrome.exe are part of the execution process, performing keylogging, clipboard logging, and Chrome password extraction, respectively.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by adding the WindowsApps folder to the %PATH% environment variable and setting up scheduled tasks to run sysBus32.exe every 3 hours.
   - **Credential Access:** libchrome.exe queries Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords, using stolen tokens from Local State and Login Data files to decrypt the stored passwords.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 servers are hosted on Novinhost, and the malware uses curl.exe to access the FTP servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** sysUp32.bat collects files created by the components and uploads them to the FTP server, including Chrome passwords and crypto-wallet data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the spyware will extract Chrome passwords for Credential Access by querying Google Chrome's SQLite databases using libchrome.exe after performing keylogging for Collection using libCache32.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogging (Collection):** The report mentions that libCache32.exe performs keylogging.
   - **Chrome Password Extraction (Credential Access):** The report explicitly states that libchrome.exe queries Google Chrome's SQLite databases to log usernames and passwords, using stolen tokens from Local State and Login Data files to decrypt the stored passwords.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report indicates that both keylogging and Chrome password extraction are part of the spyware's functionality, and there is no indication that one must occur before the other. However, the logical flow of the attack suggests that after collecting keystrokes (keylogging), the spyware would proceed to extract more valuable credentials, such as Chrome passwords.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that libCache32.exe performs keylogging.
   - The report also clearly states that libchrome.exe is responsible for extracting Chrome passwords.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report does not specify a strict order, but it is logical to assume that after collecting keystrokes, the spyware would move on to more valuable data, such as credentials.
   - Therefore, it is likely that after performing keylogging, the spyware will extract Chrome passwords.
