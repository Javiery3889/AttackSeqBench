### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT41 targets call record information and hotel reservation systems.
   - **Initial Access:** APT41 uses spear-phishing emails with .chm files.
   - **Execution:** APT41 deploys various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.
   - **Persistence:** APT41 uses rootkits and MBR bootkits.
   - **Credential Access:** APT41 uses credential stealers and keyloggers.
   - **Discovery:** APT41 moves laterally within networks.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT41 pivots between Windows and Linux systems.
   - **Collection:** APT41 collects source code and digital certificates.
   - **Impact:** APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and deploys ransomware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT41 will use credential stealers and keyloggers to access compromised systems before deploying MBR bootkits for persistence and defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access (Tactic):** The report explicitly states that APT41 uses credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials within compromised systems.
   - **Persistence (Tactic):** The report also states that APT41 deploys rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - APT41 first gains initial access using spear-phishing emails.
     - They then execute their operations using various malware, including credential stealers and keyloggers.
     - After gaining access to credentials, they move laterally within the network.
     - Finally, they deploy rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the report aligns with the question. APT41 uses credential stealers and keyloggers to gain access to credentials, which is a crucial step before deploying MBR bootkits for persistence.
   - The use of credential stealers and keyloggers is a common tactic to ensure that the threat actor has the necessary credentials to maintain access and move laterally within the network.
   - Deploying MBR bootkits for persistence and defense evasion is a subsequent step that follows the acquisition of credentials.
