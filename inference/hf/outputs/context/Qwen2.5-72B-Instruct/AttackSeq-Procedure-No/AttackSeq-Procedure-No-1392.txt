### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and other tools for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies and web shells for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will retrieve secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information on network and host configurations.
     - There is no mention of FIN13 using AWS Secrets Manager or the `enum_secrets` module.
   - **Context:**
     - FIN13's primary targets are in Mexico, and their focus is on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They are not known to target cloud services like AWS.
     - The tools and techniques described in the report are more aligned with traditional on-premises network and host reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - FIN13's reconnaissance and discovery activities are primarily focused on using native OS binaries and custom malware to gather information about the victim's network and host configurations.
     - The report does not indicate any use of cloud-based services or specific modules like `enum_secrets` for retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Operational Context:**
     - FIN13's operations are characterized by long-term intrusions and a focus on traditional cybercrime methods, which do not typically involve cloud-based secret management services.
     - The use of web shells, custom malware, and native OS binaries aligns more closely with their known tactics.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

FIN13 is more likely to use native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information on network and host configurations, rather than retrieving secrets from the AWS Secrets Manager via the `enum_secrets` module.
