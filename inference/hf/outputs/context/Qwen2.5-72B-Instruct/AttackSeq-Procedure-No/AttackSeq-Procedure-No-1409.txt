### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK).
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Also uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials. Employs certutil to launch obfuscated utilities and trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to replace KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to ensure persistence only before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and leveraging BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
     - FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to escalate privileges and extract credentials.
     - They also use trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting, which can be used for persistence.
   - **Execution:**
     - FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
     - They also use BLUEAGAVE, which establishes a local HTTP server for command execution.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report indicates that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries for credential harvesting, which can be a step towards ensuring persistence.
     - After gaining persistence, they use JSPRAT for local command execution and BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
     - FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to escalate privileges and extract credentials.
     - They then use trojanized KeePass binaries to log newly entered passwords, which can be used for persistence.
   - **Execution:**
     - After ensuring persistence, they use JSPRAT for local command execution.
     - They also use BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution, which is a passive backdoor for stealth and long-term access.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI report and the sequence of TTPs described, the most plausible sequence is that FIN13 replaces KeePass binaries with trojanized versions to ensure persistence before employing JSPRAT for local command execution and leveraging BLUEAGAVE for HTTP-based command execution.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
