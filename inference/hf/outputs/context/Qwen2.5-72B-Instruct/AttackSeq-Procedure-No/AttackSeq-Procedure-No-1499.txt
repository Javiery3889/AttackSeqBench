### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.
- These websites were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation in Bulgaria.
- The attackers switched servers after a month of campaign operations.

**Initial Access:**
- The campaign's first stage involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists.
- The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities.
- In August 2019, the group expanded its activities to target influential public figures worldwide.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Charming Kitten used email trackers to monitor whether their phishing emails were forwarded and to collect victims' geolocation and IP addresses.
- They also used a cookie installed on the victim's machine to gather data.

**Credential Access:**
- The attackers created phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services to steal credentials from victims.
- These websites were part of the campaign's second stage, which likely aimed at data theft.

**Command and Control:**
- Charming Kitten used more than six unique servers to host their fake websites.
- Four servers impersonated entities, and two impersonated Google services.
- The servers were used to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.

**Others:**
- ClearSky Security Ltd. attributed the campaign to Charming Kitten based on specific websites linked in the attack, the targeting of non-Iranian investigators, and the impersonation of NIAC.
- The group's activity was tied to Iran through the NetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers, which included an Iranian company's website.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Charming Kitten impersonated well-known researchers or journalists to initiate the cyber espionage campaign targeting non-Iranian researchers during the reconnaissance phase only after using fake websites hosted on servers from BelCloud Hosting Corporation for resource development.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Resource Development:**
  - Charming Kitten used fake websites hosted on servers from BelCloud Hosting Corporation.
  - This step is clearly part of the resource development phase.

- **Initial Access:**
  - The first stage involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists.
  - The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities.

- **Reconnaissance:**
  - The question implies that the impersonation of researchers or journalists was part of the reconnaissance phase.
  - However, the CTI report indicates that the impersonation of researchers or journalists was part of the initial access phase, not the reconnaissance phase.

- **Sequence:**
  - The report suggests that the resource development (using fake websites) and initial access (sending socially engineered emails) were part of the same campaign.
  - The impersonation of researchers or journalists was used to initiate the initial access, not the reconnaissance phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly states that the first stage of the campaign involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists.
- This impersonation was part of the initial access phase, not the reconnaissance phase.
- The resource development phase (using fake websites hosted on servers from BelCloud Hosting Corporation) was a prerequisite for the initial access phase.

Therefore, the impersonation of well-known researchers or journalists to initiate the cyber espionage campaign targeting non-Iranian researchers was not part of the reconnaissance phase but rather part of the initial access phase.

**Final Answer: B: No**
