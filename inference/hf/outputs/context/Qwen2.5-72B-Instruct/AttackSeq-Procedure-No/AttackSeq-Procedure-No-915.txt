### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office, code signing, deobfuscation, and adding remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Collection:** Searching for sensitive documents, taking screenshots, and scanning drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Using HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploading harvested documents to C&C servers.
   - **Others:** Active since 2013, targeting Ukrainian institutions, frequent domain changes, persistence techniques (scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys, Startup folder).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement only after employing modified registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report states that Gamaredon modifies registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office related to macros.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that Gamaredon injects malicious macros into Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.
   - The sequence in the question suggests that the registry key modification (Defense Evasion) must occur before the injection of malicious macros (Lateral Movement).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that both Defense Evasion and Lateral Movement are part of the attack sequence.
   - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that deactivating security mechanisms (Defense Evasion) would precede the injection of malicious macros (Lateral Movement) to ensure that the macros can execute without being blocked by security features.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Gamaredon would modify registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms before injecting malicious macros into documents.
