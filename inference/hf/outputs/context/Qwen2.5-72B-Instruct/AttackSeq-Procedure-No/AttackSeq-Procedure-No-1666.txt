### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.
   - **Discovery:** The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 would collect victim employee name information before engaging in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The CTI report explicitly states that the malware performed discovery activities by collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths. There is no mention of collecting victim employee name information.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report indicates that the malware's primary focus during the discovery phase was to gather technical information about the infected host, which aligns with the typical goals of reconnaissance in a cyber attack. Collecting victim employee name information is not a standard part of the discovery phase as described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was via a spear-phishing email with a trojanized executable.
   - The malware executed and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - The malware then engaged in discovery activities, which included collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - The report does not mention any activities related to collecting victim employee name information.
   - Given the focus on technical information during the discovery phase, it is unlikely that the malware would collect victim employee name information before engaging in these activities.
