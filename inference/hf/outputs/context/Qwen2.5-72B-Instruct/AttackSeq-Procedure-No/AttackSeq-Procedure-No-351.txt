### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent to officials at Indian embassies.
- The emails carried a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
- The RTF document dropped an embedded, encoded PE file named svchost.exe with downloader functionality.

**Command and Control:**
- The MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communicating with its C&C servers.
- Some modules lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

**Others:**
- The APT is dubbed 'Operation Transparent Tribe.'
- The malware is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module.
- Infections occur in stages, starting with a downloader component.
- The RAT can perform various functions such as keylogging, browser credential theft, webcam spying, email theft, and screen recording.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will:
1. Establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.
2. Execute on the victim's machine.
3. Attempt to download the full RAT component from 213.136.87[.]122:10001.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The weaponized RTF document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded downloader file (svchost.exe).

**Command and Control:**
- The malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication.

**Execution and Download:**
- The downloader component (svchost.exe) is likely to execute on the victim's machine.
- The downloader component is designed to download additional payloads, including the full RAT component.

**Contextual Information:**
- The malware is modular and infections occur in stages.
- The first stage is a downloader component, which aligns with the sequence described in the question.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

1. **Initial Access:**
   - The weaponized RTF document successfully exploits CVE-2012-0158 and drops the downloader file (svchost.exe).

2. **Execution:**
   - The downloader file (svchost.exe) is likely to execute on the victim's machine.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - The malware uses a custom TCP protocol for C&C communication, which is established after the initial execution.

4. **Download of Full RAT Component:**
   - The downloader component is designed to download additional payloads, including the full RAT component from the specified C&C server (213.136.87[.]122:10001).

Given the sequence of events and the modular nature of the MSIL/Crimson malware, it is highly likely that the malware will establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol before executing on the victim's machine and attempting to download the full RAT component.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
