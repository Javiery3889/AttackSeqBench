### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for long-term remote access and performs internal reconnaissance.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to ensure malware remains active.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and then perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that APT10 uses spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - **Wi-Fi Network Extraction and Brute-Force Attack:** The report does not mention any activities related to extracting Wi-Fi network names or performing brute-force attacks on Wi-Fi networks. APT10's lateral movement is primarily through shared MSP infrastructure and systems with shared access and credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10's initial access method is clearly defined as spear phishing emails.
   - The lateral movement technique described in the report is leveraging shared MSP infrastructure and systems with shared access and credentials.
   - There is no mention of APT10 extracting Wi-Fi network names or performing brute-force attacks on Wi-Fi networks.
   - The focus of APT10's lateral movement is on internal network infrastructure and shared access, not Wi-Fi networks.
