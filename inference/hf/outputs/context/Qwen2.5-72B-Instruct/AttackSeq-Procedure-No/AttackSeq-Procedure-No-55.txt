### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
     - The emails contained a malicious Word document.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
     - The documents had macros that, when enabled, downloaded and executed additional malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware (ThreatNeedle) was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
     - The spear-phishing document loaded the next stage as a backdoor running in-memory.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware registered the next stage loader-type malware for auto-execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Various techniques were used to evade detection, including deleting log files and using custom web shells.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - A credential harvesting tool named Responder was used to acquire login credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data was archived for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Multiple servers were used for C2, with a compromised router serving as a proxy.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data was exfiltrated using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Lazarus achieved execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory only after gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report mentions that the malware (ThreatNeedle) was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
     - The spear-phishing document loaded the next stage as a backdoor running in-memory.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the report is:
       1. **Reconnaissance:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
       2. **Initial Access:** Opening the malicious Word document and enabling macros.
       3. **Execution:** The document loads the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Word document.
   - After gaining initial access, the document loaded the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory.
   - This sequence aligns with the question's assertion that execution by running the ThreatNeedle backdoor in memory occurred only after gaining initial access through the spear-phishing emails.
