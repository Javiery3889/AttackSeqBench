### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, using advanced reconnaissance to know victims' whereabouts.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy malware components like small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They encrypt and store gathered data in log files and collect various secrets.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems by replacing the `pam_unix.so` file with a malicious version after deploying malware components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of the `pam_unix.so` file for persistence. However, maintaining persistence is a common goal for APTs.
   - **Common Persistence Techniques:** APTs often use various methods to maintain persistence, such as:
     - **Scheduled Tasks/Cron Jobs:** Creating tasks that run at regular intervals.
     - **Registry Keys/Startup Items:** Adding entries to the Windows Registry or startup folders.
     - **Service Creation:** Creating new services that start automatically.
     - **File Replacement:** Replacing legitimate system files with malicious versions.
   - **Contextual Information:** The Darkhotel APT is known for sophisticated techniques and has the capability to use advanced methods to maintain persistence. However, the specific mention of `pam_unix.so` is not in the report.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the Darkhotel APT is capable of sophisticated persistence techniques, the report does not provide evidence that they specifically use the `pam_unix.so` file for this purpose.
   - The report focuses more on their use of digital certificates, encryption, and targeting stored secrets, rather than file replacement for persistence.
   - Given the lack of specific mention and the variety of other persistence methods they could use, it is less likely that they would use the `pam_unix.so` file for persistence.
