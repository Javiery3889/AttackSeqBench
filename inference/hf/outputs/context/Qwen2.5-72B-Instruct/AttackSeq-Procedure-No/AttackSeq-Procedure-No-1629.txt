### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying attacks against remote services like webmail or other internet-reachable mail services.
     - They use a valid account to access the victim's network via remote services like VPN or Citrix.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system.
     - They achieve persistence by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The adversary performs a password spraying attack against domain admin accounts to gain higher privileges.
     - They move laterally to systems with domain admins logged in and use tools like NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The adversary clears Windows event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The adversary uses brute force methods like credential stuffing or password spraying to gain access to credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged user activity and other system information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities (SMB, named pipes, PsExec, WinRM) to move to domain controllers and other systems.
   - **Collection:**
     - The adversary collects data from various sources, including Microsoft SharePoint Online, file shares, and email.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially using DNS and later switching to HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and larger amounts using custom tools to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the adversary is likely to rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Mechanism:**
     - The report states that the adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the compromised system.
     - They achieve persistence by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
   - **Scheduled Tasks:**
     - The report does not mention the use of scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon.
     - The adversary's persistence mechanism involves installing the beacon on high-uptime systems, not using scheduled tasks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory without any persistence mechanisms on the initial compromised system.
   - They achieve persistence by installing the beacon on systems with high uptimes, such as servers.
   - The report does not indicate the use of scheduled tasks for executing the beacon.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the adversary will rely on scheduled tasks to execute the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory only after achieving persistence by targeting systems with high uptimes like servers.

### Final Answer: B: No
