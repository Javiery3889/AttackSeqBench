### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services (Gmail, Google Drive) and Instagram.
- These websites were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation in Bulgaria.
- The attackers switched servers after a month of campaign operations.

**Initial Access:**
- The campaign involved sending socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists.
- Victims were invited to events and then redirected to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities.
- In August 2019, the group expanded to target influential public figures worldwide.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Charming Kitten used email trackers to monitor whether their phishing emails were forwarded.
- They collected victims' geolocation and IP addresses.
- A cookie was installed on the victim's machine to gather data.

**Credential Access:**
- Phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services were used to steal credentials.
- These websites were part of the second stage of the campaign, likely aimed at data theft.

**Command and Control:**
- More than six unique servers were used to host fake websites.
- Four servers impersonated entities, and two impersonated Google services.
- These servers were used to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.

**Others:**
- ClearSky Security Ltd. attributed the campaign to Charming Kitten based on specific websites, targeting non-Iranian investigators, and impersonation of NIAC.
- The group's activity was tied to Iran through the NetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers, which included an Iranian company's website.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials during the Resource Development phase, is it likely that they gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance Phase:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention the Reconnaissance phase.
- However, it is common for threat actors to gather information about their targets before launching an attack.
- The report mentions that the campaign involved sending socially engineered emails impersonating known researchers or journalists, which suggests that the attackers had some prior knowledge of their targets.

**Resource Development Phase:**
- The report states that Charming Kitten created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials.
- This phase is focused on setting up the infrastructure and tools needed for the attack.

**Initial Access Phase:**
- The report mentions that the campaign involved sending socially engineered emails to invite victims to events and then redirecting them to decoy websites.
- This suggests that the attackers had a list of targeted individuals' email addresses before the attack.

**Conclusion:**
- Given that the attackers sent socially engineered emails to specific individuals, it is highly likely that they gathered these email addresses through some form of reconnaissance, such as open source research and website contact forms.
- The report does not explicitly state this, but it is a logical inference based on the nature of the attack and common TTPs of threat actors.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report mentions that Charming Kitten sent socially engineered emails to specific individuals.
2. To send these emails, the attackers needed a list of targeted individuals' email addresses.
3. It is common for threat actors to gather such information through open source research and website contact forms during the Reconnaissance phase.
4. The report does not explicitly state this, but the nature of the attack and common TTPs support this inference.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
