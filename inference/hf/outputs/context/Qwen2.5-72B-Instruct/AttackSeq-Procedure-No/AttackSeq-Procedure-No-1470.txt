### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture.
- Use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, and social media data collection.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.
- Install BlackEnergy 3 on targeted electricity distributors after employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros.

**Credential Access:**
- BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
- Use stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional credentials, and create new privileged accounts.

**Discovery:**
- Conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand access.
- Use valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins to enumerate systems and identify targets.

**Command and Control:**
- Malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to attacker-controlled CC server.
- The external connection is established as part of the execution routine following installation of the malicious files.

**Impact:**
- Develop and deliver malicious computer code updates for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters.
- Deliver KillDisk malware to a network share and set policy on the domain controller to retrieve and execute upon system reboot.
- Schedule unauthorized outages of UPS for critical systems.
- Trip breakers to disrupt power distribution.
- Sever connections to field devices.
- Initiate a telephony denial-of-service attack.
- Disable critical systems via UPS outages.
- Destroy critical system data using KillDisk malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After reconnaissance activities such as gathering publicly available information on systems and conducting active discovery methods, is it likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will use Ruby scripts to execute payloads after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
- The report clearly states that adversaries use reconnaissance to gather information and conduct active discovery.
- Initial access is gained through a phishing campaign where employees open weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3.

**Malware Execution:**
- The report mentions that BlackEnergy 3 is installed after employees enable macros.
- However, it does not specify the scripting language used by BlackEnergy 3 to execute payloads.

**Common Malware Characteristics:**
- BlackEnergy 3 is known to use VBA scripts and other Windows-based scripting methods to execute payloads.
- Ruby scripts are less common in this context, especially for malware that primarily targets Windows environments.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention the use of Ruby scripts in the execution of BlackEnergy 3.
- BlackEnergy 3 is known to use VBA scripts and other Windows-based methods, which are more common and effective in this context.
- The use of Ruby scripts is less likely given the nature of the attack and the typical characteristics of BlackEnergy 3.

**Final Answer:**
- B: No
