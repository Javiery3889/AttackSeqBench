### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
- Security vulnerabilities were exploited to execute scripts directly on the host.
- A binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe".

**Defense Evasion:**
- APT-TOCS used techniques to evade detection by security software and firewalls.
- The attack pattern included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and multi-beacon communication to evade sandbox detection.

**Lateral Movement:**
- APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network as required.

**Command and Control:**
- APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.
- Communication with compromised systems was via HTTP GET requests to specific URLs, with heartbeat packages transmitted using Cookie fields every 60 seconds.

**Others:**
- APT-TOCS is related to Cobalt Strike.
- The attack can penetrate firewalls, is undetectable, and can attack various platforms.
- The threat has been active for 5 years and is considered an APT due to its targeted nature, anti-detection functions, and ability to conceal itself.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After APT-TOCS gained initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control of targeted systems, is it likely that Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory during the core step of the attack only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack pattern included running in memory and multi-beacon communication to evade detection.

**Sequence Analysis:**
- The report indicates that the Shellcode scripts were executed using "powershell.exe" for initial access.
- The defense evasion techniques, including running in memory and multi-beacon communication, were part of the attack pattern but not explicitly stated to occur only after initial access.

**Logical Sequence:**
- It is plausible that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory as part of the initial access to evade detection.
- Multi-beacon communication is a technique used for defense evasion and could be employed during the initial access or as part of the ongoing attack.

**Conclusion:**
- The report does not explicitly state that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory only after the attackers employed multi-beacon communication.
- However, the use of multi-beacon communication for defense evasion is a key feature of the attack and could be part of the initial access or subsequent steps.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the information provided, it is more likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory as part of the initial access to evade detection, and multi-beacon communication was used as part of the overall attack pattern.

**Final Answer: B: No**
