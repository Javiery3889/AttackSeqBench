### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack begins with a spear-phishing email targeting specific entities.
     - The email contains an attachment that, when opened, leads to the installation of malware.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Taidoor malware is delivered via email attachments.
     - The attachment exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware.
     - A decoy document is opened to avoid suspicion.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Taidoor malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
     - The request includes an encrypted MAC address of the compromised computer.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicates with two CnC servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.
     - The network traffic has been modified to use different file path names and formats.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Taidoor is likely to perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the malware is delivered via a spear-phishing email and exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office to drop the malware.
     - A decoy document is opened to avoid suspicion, which is a common technique to ensure the user does not become suspicious and close the attachment.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
     - The request includes an encrypted MAC address, which suggests that the malware is designed to identify the compromised system.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicates with specific CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.
     - The report does not explicitly mention anti-sandboxing or anti-virtualization checks.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Anti-sandboxing and Anti-virtualization Checks:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state that Taidoor performs anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks, it is a common practice for sophisticated malware to include such checks to avoid detection in controlled environments.
     - The use of a consistent HTTP GET request pattern and the inclusion of an encrypted MAC address suggest that the malware is designed to be stealthy and avoid detection.
     - The modification of the network traffic pattern to use different file path names and formats also indicates a level of sophistication that is often associated with malware that includes anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks.

### Final Answer
Given the sophistication of the Taidoor malware and the common practice of including anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks in such malware, it is likely that Taidoor will perform these checks before communicating with its CnC servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
