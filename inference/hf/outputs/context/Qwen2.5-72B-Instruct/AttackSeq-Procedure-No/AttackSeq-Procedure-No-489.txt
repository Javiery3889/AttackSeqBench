### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files in specified directories.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase only after dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report clearly states that FamousSparrow collected system information and probed files in specified directories as part of the Discovery phase.
   - **Credential Access:** The report does not mention any use of Mimikatz or any other tool for credential dumping. The Privilege Escalation section is also vague and does not provide specific details.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not indicate that credential dumping is a prerequisite for the Discovery phase. The actions in the Discovery phase are described independently of any credential access activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a clear sequence of actions for the Discovery phase, which includes collecting system information and probing files.
   - There is no mention of credential dumping using Mimikatz or any other tool in the report.
   - The lack of specific details on Privilege Escalation and Credential Access suggests that these activities, if they occurred, were not a necessary step before the Discovery phase.
