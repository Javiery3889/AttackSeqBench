### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
- The attack involves the Bankshot malware implant.
- The attack resembles previous attacks against the global financial network SWIFT.

**Resource Development:**
- Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain similar to the cryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin.
- The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created and updated before the attack.
- The domain is not associated with the legitimate entity.

**Execution:**
- The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx).
- The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878.
- The Flash script downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.

**Persistence:**
- Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The implant is designed to evade detection.
- It contains functionality to wipe files and content to erase evidence.

**Command and Control:**
- The implants communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.
- The control server URLs are hardcoded in the implants' code.

**Others:**
- The campaign is successful against unpatched Flash versions.
- The documents with the Flash exploit evaded static defenses.
- This is the first time Bankshot has been tied directly to financial-related hacking.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that Hidden Cobra would use valid account information such as VPN credentials to remotely access victim networks before executing the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack starts with a malicious Word document containing an embedded Flash script.
- The Flash script exploits CVE-2018-4878 to download and execute the Bankshot implant.
- The implant is designed to persist and evade detection.
- The attack does not mention the use of valid account information or remote access methods like VPN credentials.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This would imply that Hidden Cobra uses valid account information to gain initial access before deploying the Bankshot implant.
  - The CTI report does not mention any use of valid account information or remote access methods.
  - The attack sequence described in the report starts with a social engineering vector (malicious Word document) and an exploit (Flash script).

- **B: No**
  - This aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.
  - The report clearly states that the initial access is gained through a malicious document and a Flash exploit, not through valid account information or remote access methods.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report describes a clear attack sequence starting with a social engineering vector (malicious Word document) and an exploit (Flash script).
- There is no mention of using valid account information or remote access methods like VPN credentials.
- The attack is designed to be stealthy and persistent, but the initial access method is through a document exploit.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
