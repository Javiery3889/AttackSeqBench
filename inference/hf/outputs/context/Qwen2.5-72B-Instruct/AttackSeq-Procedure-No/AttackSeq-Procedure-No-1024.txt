### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Turla uses a watering hole attack on Armenian websites.
     - Malicious JavaScript is inserted into compromised websites.
     - The JavaScript fingerprints the visitor's browser and potentially delivers a second-stage malicious JavaScript.
   - **Execution:**
     - A fake Adobe Flash update warning is used to trick users into downloading and installing malware.
     - The fake installer installs both Turla malware and a legitimate Adobe Flash program.
   - **Persistence:**
     - NetFlash and PyFlash establish persistence using Windows scheduled tasks.
     - NetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and sets up a scheduled task.
     - PyFlash persists by modifying the Windows task that regularly launches the malware.
   - **Discovery:**
     - PyFlash executes OS-related commands to gather information about the machine.
     - The gathered information is sent to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The output of PyFlash surveillance and C&C commands is exfiltrated using the C&C protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that NetFlash and PyFlash will use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The report mentions that PyFlash sends gathered information to the C&C server but does not specify the protocol used (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.).
     - The report does not mention the use of Asymmetric Cryptography for C&C communication.
   - **Common Practices:**
     - While HTTPS is a common protocol for secure communication, the use of Asymmetric Cryptography for C&C communication is not explicitly stated in the report.
     - Turla, being a sophisticated group, might use HTTPS to evade detection, but the report does not provide evidence of this specific practice.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any specific information about the use of HTTPS or Asymmetric Cryptography for C&C communication.
   - Given the lack of explicit details, it is not safe to assume that NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS with Asymmetric Cryptography for C&C communication.
   - Therefore, the most plausible answer is that it is not likely that NetFlash and PyFlash use HTTPS for communicating with their respective C&C servers using Asymmetric Cryptography.

### Final Answer
