### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - SideCopy targets government personnel in India.
     - Uses decoys and honeytraps to lure victims.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains.
     - Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploys RATs and plugins, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and targets Kavach.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting Kavach.
     - Uses njRAT with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
     - Uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Uses themes to target military personnel.
     - Uses honeytraps and cloned websites.
   - **Collection:**
     - Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
     - Verifies requests from specific geographies (India and Pakistan).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT only after using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report states that SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting Kavach.
     - They use njRAT with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
     - They use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases, which is part of the exfiltration process.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state a strict sequence where njRAT is used only after exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases.
     - However, the use of njRAT and GoLang-based file recon plugins are both part of the credential access and exfiltration processes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - SideCopy's primary goal is to harvest credentials, particularly from Kavach.
     - They use njRAT to target Kavach.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - They use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not specify a strict sequence where njRAT is used only after exfiltration.
     - It is more likely that both njRAT and GoLang-based file recon plugins are used in parallel or in a flexible sequence to achieve the goal of credential harvesting and exfiltration.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The report does not indicate a strict sequence where njRAT is used only after exfiltrating Kavach authentication databases. Both njRAT and GoLang-based file recon plugins are part of the credential access and exfiltration processes, but they are likely used in a flexible manner to achieve the goal of credential harvesting.
