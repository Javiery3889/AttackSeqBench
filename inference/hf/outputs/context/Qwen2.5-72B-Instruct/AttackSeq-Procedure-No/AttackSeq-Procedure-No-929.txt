### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Emissary Panda used tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Uploaded tools including Mimikatz and custom backdoors like HyperBro.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and maintained access with China Chopper webshell.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used the HyperBro backdoor for command and control over HTTPS.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems only after exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
   - **Execution:**
     - They uploaded tools including Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - They performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - They moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.

   The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that:
   - **Reconnaissance** was performed to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
   - **Initial Access** was gained by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
   - **Execution** involved uploading tools like Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery** was performed to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.

   The question specifically asks if network reconnaissance was performed only after gaining initial access and installing webshells. The CTI report indicates that reconnaissance was an ongoing activity, but it does not explicitly state that it was performed only after initial access. However, the logical sequence of events suggests that reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems for lateral movement would occur after gaining initial access and establishing a foothold in the network.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the logical sequence of events and the information provided in the CTI report, it is likely that Emissary Panda performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems after gaining initial access and installing webshells.

   **Final Answer: A: Yes**
