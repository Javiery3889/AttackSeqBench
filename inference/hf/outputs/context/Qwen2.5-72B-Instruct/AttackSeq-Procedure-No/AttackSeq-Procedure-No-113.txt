### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code is crucial for further attack phases.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the compromised network.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for further access and lateral movement.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to find relevant systems and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Moving across the network to reach strategic goals.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the data from the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether attackers ensure persistence within the target network only after executing malicious code on a local or remote system.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The report states that execution of malicious code is a prerequisite for further attack phases, including persistence.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that persistence points are established to ensure ongoing access to the compromised network.
   - **Sequence:** The report implies that execution must occur before persistence can be established. This is because the attacker needs to execute code to gain control and set up persistence mechanisms.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attacker gains initial access to the network.
   - **Execution:** The attacker executes malicious code to gain control over the system.
   - **Persistence:** The attacker then sets up persistence mechanisms to ensure ongoing access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attacker may also engage in defense evasion to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The attacker may obtain valid credentials to facilitate further access and lateral movement.
   - **Discovery:** The attacker explores the network to find relevant systems and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attacker moves across the network to reach strategic goals.
   - **Collection:** The attacker gathers the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** The attacker maintains control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attacker extracts the data from the network.

   Based on the sequence described in the report, persistence is established after the execution of malicious code. Therefore, the answer to the question is:

### Final Answer: A: Yes
