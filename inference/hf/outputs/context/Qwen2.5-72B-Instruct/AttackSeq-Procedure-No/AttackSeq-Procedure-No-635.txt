### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack leveraged a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-13720, in Google Chrome.
- The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal.
- A malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the main page to redirect victims to the exploit landing page.
- The script checked the victim's system for compatibility, targeting 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer.

**Persistence:**
- The malware installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
- The final payload was downloaded as an encrypted binary (worst.jpg), decrypted by the shellcode, and dropped as updata.exe to disk.

**Command and Control:**
- The main module, msdisp64.exe, downloaded the next stage from a hardcoded C2 server.
- The next stages were located in folders with the victim computer names on the C2 server.

**Others:**
- Technical details include the use of AJAX requests to download exploit code chunks.
- RC4 was used for decryption.
- The browser exploit script was obfuscated.
- BigInt was used for 64-bit arithmetic in JavaScript.
- Debugging code was left in the production code.
- MD5 and SHA256 hashes and domain names are provided.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before the malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome, is it likely that attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack used a zero-day exploit in Google Chrome.
- The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection.
- A malicious JavaScript code was used to redirect victims to the exploit landing page.
- The script checked for system compatibility.

**Heap Spraying:**
- Heap spraying is a technique used to increase the likelihood of successful exploitation by filling the heap with a specific pattern of data, often to create a predictable memory layout.
- This technique is often used in browser exploits to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute shellcode.

**Contextual Analysis:**
- The report does not explicitly mention heap spraying.
- However, given that the attack involved a zero-day exploit in Google Chrome, it is plausible that advanced techniques like heap spraying were used to ensure the exploit's success.
- The use of a zero-day exploit suggests that the attackers were sophisticated and likely employed multiple techniques to ensure the exploit worked reliably.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The attack involved a zero-day exploit in Google Chrome, which is a sophisticated and advanced technique.
2. Zero-day exploits often require additional techniques to ensure successful execution, such as heap spraying.
3. The report mentions the use of JavaScript to redirect victims and check system compatibility, which aligns with the use of heap spraying to prepare the memory environment for the exploit.
4. While the report does not explicitly state the use of heap spraying, the nature of the attack and the sophistication of the threat actors suggest that such techniques were likely employed.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
