### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Phosphorus group exploited the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (ProxyShell) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The PowerLess Backdoor executes PowerShell code within a .NET application context to avoid detection.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerLess Backdoor creates persistence through scheduled tasks, Registry RunKeys, or Startup Folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor runs PowerShell within a .NET application and modifies the registry to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The backdoor includes a keylogger and uses LOLBIN techniques to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor performs account discovery.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor archives collected data, including browser data and keylogging information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with a C2 server using web protocols and encrypted channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use WinRM for lateral movement before dumping credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that the attackers used ProxyShell to gain initial access and executed PowerShell code within a .NET application to evade detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of WinRM for lateral movement. Instead, it focuses on the use of web shells and other persistence mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that the PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger and uses LOLBIN techniques to dump credentials. This indicates that credential dumping is a key part of the attack sequence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that the attackers used WinRM for lateral movement. Instead, it focuses on the use of web shells and other persistence mechanisms.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report suggests that after gaining initial access and executing the backdoor, the attackers immediately focus on credential access and persistence.
   - Given the focus on credential access and the lack of mention of WinRM, it is unlikely that the attackers would use WinRM for lateral movement before dumping credentials.
