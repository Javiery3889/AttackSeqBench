### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The 'yty' framework uses a malicious Excel document named 'Circular.xls' with macros to execute an embedded executable.

**Execution:**
- The framework includes two downloaders: a stripped-down C++ program (Downloader 1) and a more functional downloader (Downloader 2) with anti-sandbox detection.

**Persistence:**
- A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' ensures persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The framework uses junk code, anti-sandbox detection, and creates logs for debugging.

**Collection:**
- The 'yty' framework collects files, takes screenshots, and logs keystrokes using plugins:
  - 'vstservice.exe' for document listing
  - 'abode.exe' for file exfiltration
  - 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging
  - 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots
  - 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering

**Command and Control:**
- The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise traffic, downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host, and sends beacon messages with system information.

**Others:**
- The Donot Team is believed to be behind 'yty', and their TTPs, infrastructure, and malware code are similar to the EHDevel malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the 'yty' framework employs its plugins like 'vstservice.exe' for document listing, 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging, and 'dspcheck.exe' for capturing screenshots after exfiltrating gathered data.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Collection Phase:**
  - The report explicitly states that the 'yty' framework includes plugins for document listing, keylogging, and taking screenshots.
  - These plugins are:
    - 'vstservice.exe' for document listing
    - 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging
    - 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots

- **Exfiltration Phase:**
  - The report mentions that the framework is capable of file exfiltration using 'abode.exe'.
  - The C2 communication strategy involves sending beacon messages with system information and receiving instructions for further actions.

- **Sequence of TTPs:**
  - The collection of data (document listing, keylogging, and screenshots) is a prerequisite for exfiltration.
  - The exfiltration mechanism is described as automated and involves sending the collected data to the C2 server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly indicates that the 'yty' framework uses specific plugins for document listing, keylogging, and taking screenshots.
- These plugins are part of the collection phase, which is necessary before the exfiltration phase.
- The exfiltration mechanism is automated and involves sending the collected data to the C2 server.

Given this information, it is highly likely that the 'yty' framework employs its plugins for document listing, keylogging, and capturing screenshots as part of its data collection and exfiltration process.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
