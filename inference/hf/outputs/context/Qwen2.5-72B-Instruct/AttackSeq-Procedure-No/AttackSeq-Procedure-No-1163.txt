### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - ProjectM actors developed a toolset including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs.
     - They used the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload.
     - Infrastructure was often registered with WHOIS protection, but two domains were registered without protection.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
     - Delivered payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, and RATs like DarkComet and Bozok.
     - Techniques included exploiting vulnerabilities and using malicious macros.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used WHOIS protection services to conceal infrastructure.
     - Lapses in WHOIS protection revealed connections to an individual.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - C2 infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection.
     - Two domains were linked to an individual's email address and used to host C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan.
   - **Others:**
     - The individual linked to ProjectM's infrastructure has skills in offensive cyber operations.
     - Anti-Indian sentiment suggests a potential political motivation.
     - PII of Indian Army personnel was found on C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - ProjectM gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report does not explicitly state that reconnaissance efforts (gathering victim identity information) were conducted only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection.
   - **C2 Infrastructure:**
     - The C2 infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection, but two domains were registered without protection.
   - **Victim Information:**
     - PII of Indian Army personnel was found on C2 servers, indicating that victim identity information was collected, but the timing of this collection relative to domain registration is not specified.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that ProjectM actors used spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
   - The collection of PII from Indian Army personnel suggests that reconnaissance and data collection were part of their operations.
   - However, the report does not specify that this reconnaissance was conducted only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection.
   - The use of WHOIS protection services and the lapses in it are more about concealing the infrastructure rather than the timing of reconnaissance activities.

### Final Answer
Given the information provided, it is not likely that ProjectM actors gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts only after registering domains with or without WHOIS protection services. The report does not provide a clear timeline for when the reconnaissance activities occurred relative to domain registration.

**Final Answer: B: No**
