### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - The emails were designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Execution:**
     - Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute.
     - The macro would call a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
     - The PowerShell script would download and execute payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The PowerShell script operated in memory to avoid detection.
     - It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads.
     - It used the DownloadString method to contact the C2 server and the DownloadData method to download a resource from a second C2 server.
   - **Impact:**
     - The payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
     - GandCrab would encrypt files, and Ursnif would perform credential harvesting and gather system and process information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the observed campaign will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document only before gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is gained through phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with embedded macros.
   - The sequence of events is as follows:
     1. The user receives a phishing email.
     2. The user opens the attached Word document.
     3. The VBS macro in the Word document executes.
     4. The macro retrieves and runs an encoded PowerShell script.
     5. The PowerShell script downloads and executes the payloads (Ursnif and GandCrab).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The VBS macros are part of the initial access mechanism. They are embedded in the Word document, which is delivered via phishing emails.
   - The execution of the VBS macros is a necessary step to gain initial access and proceed with the attack.
   - The question asks if the VBS macros are executed only before gaining initial access, which is accurate based on the report.
