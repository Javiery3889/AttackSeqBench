### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework.
- Malicious JavaScript was delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
- Victims received a zipped file containing the malicious JavaScript.
- The JavaScript was executed by wscript.exe, which then downloaded additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

**Execution:**
- Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell.
- A .NET injector from the Donut project was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.

**Defense Evasion:**
- PsExec was used to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
- Ransomware deployment involved disabling security features.

**Credential Access:**
- Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and log file manipulation.

**Discovery:**
- Commands like whoami, net user, and net group were used for profiling.
- PowerView's Get-NetComputer command was used to search for computer objects in Active Directory.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.

**Impact:**
- WastedLocker ransomware was deployed to encrypt computers and servers.

**Others:**
- Symantec's advanced analytics and threat hunting teams detected and responded to the attacks.
- The attackers targeted major U.S. corporations, including Fortune 500 companies.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Is it likely that the attackers researched software code to enable supply-chain operations as part of the Reconnaissance phase before using the SocGholish framework to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Yes
B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance Phase:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention a Reconnaissance phase.
- The report starts with the Initial Access phase, where the SocGholish framework was used to compromise legitimate websites and deliver malicious JavaScript.

**Supply-Chain Operations:**
- The report does not mention any research or supply-chain operations.
- The initial access method involved compromising legitimate websites, not supply-chain attacks.

**Contextual Information:**
- The attackers demonstrated skill and experience, capable of penetrating well-protected corporations.
- However, the report does not provide evidence of supply-chain research or operations.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report focuses on the attack sequence starting from the Initial Access phase.
- There is no mention of a Reconnaissance phase involving supply-chain operations.
- The initial access method involved compromising legitimate websites, which is different from supply-chain attacks.
- The report emphasizes the use of the SocGholish framework and malicious JavaScript, but does not indicate any prior research into software code for supply-chain operations.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
