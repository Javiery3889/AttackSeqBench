### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with initial contact and compromising the first victim.
   - **Execution:** Malicious code is executed to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensures ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gains higher privileges to install malware and persistence points.
   - **Credential Access:** Acquires valid credentials for legitimate access and lateral movement.
   - **Discovery:** Explores the network to find relevant systems and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Moves across the network to reach the target data.
   - **Collection:** Gathers the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Establishes communication channels to control the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Transfers the collected data out of the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether threat actors will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms only after escalating privileges to gain administrative control over the target network.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that valid credentials are crucial for accessing systems and moving laterally within the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that privilege escalation is often necessary to install malware and persistence points, and to gain access to strategic goals.
   - **Bypassing Detection Mechanisms:** The report does not explicitly mention bypassing detection mechanisms, but it is implied that attackers will take steps to avoid detection throughout the attack. However, the question specifically asks about the timing of this action relative to privilege escalation.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access and Privilege Escalation:** The report indicates that credential access is a prerequisite for lateral movement and privilege escalation. Once valid credentials are obtained, attackers can use them to move laterally and escalate privileges.
   - **Bypassing Detection:** While the report does not explicitly state when detection mechanisms are bypassed, it is logical to assume that attackers will attempt to bypass detection mechanisms as early as possible to avoid being caught. This can happen at various stages, including initial access, execution, and persistence.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The question implies a specific sequence where detection mechanisms are bypassed only after privilege escalation. However, the report suggests that bypassing detection is a continuous process that can occur at multiple stages of the attack.

### Final Answer
Given the continuous nature of bypassing detection mechanisms and the fact that the report does not specify that this action is only taken after privilege escalation, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
