### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files, and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, and enumerating running processes (including browsers).
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication and fallback channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, compressing browser profile data, and scheduled transfers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after discovery activities (enumerating running processes and gathering browser data), Machete will collect files by copying them from local systems and removable media only before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report mentions that Machete enumerates running processes and gathers browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials.
   - **Collection Activities:** The report states that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report indicates that Machete exfiltrates all collected files, including browser profile data, which is compressed and encrypted.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The discovery activities (enumerating processes and gathering browser data) are part of the broader data collection process.
   - The collection activities include copying files from local systems and removable media, but they are not limited to this. The malware also logs keystrokes, captures screenshots, and steals clipboard contents.
   - The exfiltration process involves all collected data, including browser profile data, which suggests that credentials from password stores are also exfiltrated.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that Machete will only collect files from local systems and removable media before targeting and exfiltrating credentials from password stores. The collection and exfiltration processes are more comprehensive and include multiple types of data.
