### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. It used a multi-stage execution process involving shellcode and a temporary file.
   - **Execution:** The malware used a legitimate Microsoft executable (igfxtray.exe) to sideload a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll). This DLL performed security product checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry key modifications and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware was designed to evade detection by customizing its installation to avoid 24 identified security products and using multi-stage checks to detect analysis by security researchers.
   - **Command and Control:** T9000 communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrated various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives. The data was compressed, encrypted, and stored in specific directories or sent to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to use LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay to gather NetNTLM credentials for subsequent attacks before exfiltrating data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that T9000 uses extensive evasion techniques, including customizing its installation to avoid detection by security products and researchers. However, it does not mention LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report clearly states that T9000 exfiltrates data through compressed and encrypted network traffic, which aligns with the question.
   - **LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay:** These techniques are not mentioned in the report. LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay are typically used to gather NetNTLM credentials, which can be used for lateral movement or further attacks. While these techniques are common in many advanced attacks, the report does not provide any evidence that T9000 uses them.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides detailed information about T9000's evasion techniques, but it does not mention LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning or SMB Relay.
   - The exfiltration method described in the report (compressed and encrypted network traffic) matches the question.
   - Given the lack of evidence in the report about LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay, it is unlikely that T9000 uses these techniques in the described attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
