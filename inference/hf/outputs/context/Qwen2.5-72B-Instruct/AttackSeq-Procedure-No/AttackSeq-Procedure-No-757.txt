### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
     - The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
     - The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The macro executed shellcode in winword.exe.
     - The shellcode downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
     - Both payloads were executed using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 only before performing initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report states that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrates data using RC4 encryption and Base64 encoding.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report also states that the Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information such as network adapter details, computer name, and IP address.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it implies that the exfiltration happens after the initial reconnaissance.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The exfiltration process involves encrypting and obfuscating data before sending it to the control server.
   - The initial reconnaissance is performed to gather the necessary information to exfiltrate.
   - Therefore, the initial reconnaissance must occur before the exfiltration.

### Final Answer
The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information before exfiltrating data. The exfiltration process involves encrypting the data using RC4 and obfuscating it with Base64 encoding. Therefore, it is not likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 only before performing initial reconnaissance.

**Final Answer: B: No**
