### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employs passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies and web shells for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will dump LSASS process memory to obtain credentials before gathering information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials. This is a common technique for privilege escalation.
   - **Discovery:** The report also states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance to gather information on network and host configurations.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions. However, it is logical to assume that credential harvesting (privilege escalation) would occur before or during the reconnaissance phase to gain the necessary access to gather detailed information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Harvesting:** Dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials is a crucial step for privilege escalation, which is necessary to gain higher-level access within the network.
   - **Reconnaissance:** Once higher-level access is obtained, FIN13 can use native OS binaries and other tools to gather detailed information about the network and host configurations.
   - **Logical Sequence:** It is more likely that FIN13 would first ensure they have the necessary credentials to move laterally and gather information, rather than performing reconnaissance without the required access.
