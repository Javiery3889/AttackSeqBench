### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CosmicDuke uses document-based exploits (malicious PDF files with embedded Flash objects) and social engineering to deceive victims into opening the files.
     - The exploit targets the CVE-2011-0611 vulnerability in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat products.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
     - The loader was updated in mid-April 2014, and CosmicDuke samples began using the updated loader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and a Windows service named 'javamtsup' to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Collection:**
     - The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     - It also searches removable drives for files.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to communicate with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating before collecting information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that CosmicDuke exfiltrates information via FTP.
     - There is no mention of WebDav in the report.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report specifies that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of exfiltration and collection. However, it is logical to assume that the malware would collect information before exfiltrating it.
     - The question suggests that exfiltration happens before collection, which is not supported by the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that CosmicDuke uses document-based exploits to gain initial access and execute the malware.
   - The malware then establishes persistence and collects information using various methods.
   - The collected information is exfiltrated via FTP.
   - The report does not mention WebDav, and the sequence of exfiltration before collection is not supported by the report.
