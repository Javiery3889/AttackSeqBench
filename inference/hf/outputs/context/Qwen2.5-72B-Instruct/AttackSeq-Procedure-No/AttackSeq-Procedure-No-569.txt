### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used system services (T1569) and software deployment tools (T1072) to execute code.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide specific details but implies the attackers maintained their foothold carefully.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The use of valid accounts (T1078) is mentioned.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used Process Discovery (T1057) and Query Registry (T1012) to gain knowledge about the systems and network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network but does not specify techniques.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used Application Layer Protocol (T1071) and Dynamic Resolution (T1568) for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the threat actors would likely use Process Discovery (T1057) and Query Registry (T1012) techniques only after gaining elevated permissions through Privilege Escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Phase:** The report mentions that the attackers used system services (T1569) and software deployment tools (T1072) to execute code.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the attackers used Process Discovery (T1057) and Query Registry (T1012) to gain knowledge about the systems and network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report does not explicitly mention Privilege Escalation techniques, but it is a common tactic in advanced attacks to gain elevated permissions to perform more extensive actions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **Execution:** The attackers executed code using system services and software deployment tools.
     - **Discovery:** The attackers then used Process Discovery and Query Registry to gather information about the systems and network.
     - **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, it is logical to assume that the attackers would need elevated permissions to perform more extensive discovery and maintain persistence.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - The attackers would likely perform initial discovery (Process Discovery and Query Registry) to understand the environment before attempting to escalate privileges. This is because discovery techniques often provide the necessary information to identify targets for privilege escalation.
     - However, the question asks if the discovery techniques were used **only** after gaining elevated permissions, which is less likely. Discovery is often a precursor to privilege escalation, not a result of it.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The threat actors would likely use Process Discovery and Query Registry techniques to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network before or during the process of gaining elevated permissions, rather than only after.
