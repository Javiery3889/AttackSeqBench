### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Korplug creates hidden system directories and sets up persistence via scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, encrypted with RC4.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after using a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages, it is likely that Korplug will perform data discovery on the system, such as collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The report mentions that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol and can download additional files from the C&C server. This indicates that data exfiltration is a key part of the attack.
   - **Data Discovery:** The report explicitly states that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, including metadata and content from all mapped drives. This is a clear indication that data discovery is a significant part of the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The attack starts with phishing and a custom loader to execute Korplug.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** Korplug establishes persistence and uses various techniques to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from various sources, including metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom protocol, which is likely used for data exfiltration.

Given the sequence of TTPs described in the report, it is clear that data discovery (collecting metadata and content from all mapped drives) is a crucial step in the attack, and it occurs before data exfiltration.
