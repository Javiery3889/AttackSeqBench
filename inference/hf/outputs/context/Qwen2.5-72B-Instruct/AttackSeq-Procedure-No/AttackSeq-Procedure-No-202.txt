### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers use legitimate tools such as SysInternals PsExec and WinExe to move laterally across the network.
- **Tools**: WinExe is an open-source equivalent to PsExec and can be controlled from a Linux computer, such as a compromised Linux web server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Initial Compromise**: The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use spear phishing to initially compromise victims.
- **Subsequent Actions**: After the initial compromise, the question mentions mapping the network and collecting passwords using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Compromise**: The CTI report does not explicitly mention the initial compromise method. However, the question states that the attackers use spear phishing to execute GreyEnergy mini, which is a known initial compromise technique.
- **Subsequent Actions**: The CTI report focuses on lateral movement using PsExec and WinExe. The question mentions mapping the network and collecting passwords, which are typical actions after the initial compromise to prepare for lateral movement.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Compromise**: Spear phishing is a common method for initial compromise, and the question states that the attackers use it to execute GreyEnergy mini. This aligns with typical initial access tactics.
2. **Network Mapping and Password Collection**: After gaining initial access, attackers often map the network and collect passwords to facilitate lateral movement. Tools like Nmap and Mimikatz are commonly used for these purposes.
3. **Lateral Movement**: The CTI report confirms that the attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement, which is consistent with the sequence of actions described in the question.

### Final Answer
Given the typical sequence of actions in a cyber attack and the information provided in the question and CTI report, it is likely that the attackers will use spear phishing to initially compromise victims before mapping the network and collecting passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
