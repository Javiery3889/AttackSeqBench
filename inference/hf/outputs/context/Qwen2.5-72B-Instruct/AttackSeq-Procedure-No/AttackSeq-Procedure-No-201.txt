### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Lateral Movement**: The attackers use legitimate tools such as SysInternals PsExec and WinExe to move laterally across the compromised network.
- **Tools**: PsExec and WinExe are used for lateral movement.
- **Context**: WinExe is an open-source equivalent to PsExec and can be controlled from a Linux computer, such as a compromised Linux web server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement across the compromised network, is it likely that they will map the network and collect passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz only after using spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Lateral Movement**: The CTI report clearly states that the attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
- **Network Mapping and Password Collection**: The report does not mention the use of Nmap for network mapping or Mimikatz for password collection.
- **Spearphishing and GreyEnergy Mini**: The report does not mention the use of spearphishing emails or the execution of GreyEnergy mini.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Lateral Movement**: The report confirms that the attackers use PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
2. **Network Mapping and Password Collection**: The report does not provide any information about the attackers mapping the network with Nmap or collecting passwords with Mimikatz.
3. **Spearphishing and GreyEnergy Mini**: The report does not mention any spearphishing activities or the use of GreyEnergy mini.

Given the information in the CTI report, it is not likely that the attackers will map the network and collect passwords with tools like Nmap and Mimikatz only after using spearphishing emails to execute GreyEnergy mini. The report focuses on the use of PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement and does not provide any context for the other activities mentioned in the question.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
