### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, modifying registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office, code signing, deobfuscation, and adding remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Collection:** Searching for sensitive documents, taking screenshots, and scanning drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Using HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploading harvested documents to C&C servers.
   - **Others:** Persistence techniques include scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys, and leveraging the Startup folder.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after deactivating security mechanisms in Microsoft Office during Defense Evasion, Gamaredon will deactivate PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to tamper with the sshd configuration for Persistence before injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents for Lateral Movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Gamaredon modifies registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms in Microsoft Office related to macros. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Persistence:** The report lists persistence techniques such as scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys, and leveraging the Startup folder. However, there is no mention of deactivating PAM modules or tampering with the sshd configuration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report clearly states that Gamaredon injects malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and uses Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. This aligns with the last part of the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not mention any activities related to deactivating PAM modules or tampering with the sshd configuration. These actions are typically associated with Unix-like systems and are not mentioned in the context of the Gamaredon group's activities, which are primarily focused on Windows systems.
   - The sequence described in the question (deactivating PAM modules before injecting malicious macros) does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
