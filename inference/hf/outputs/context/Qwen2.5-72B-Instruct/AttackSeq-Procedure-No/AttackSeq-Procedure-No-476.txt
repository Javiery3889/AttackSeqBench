### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` binary and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` binary and ensuring it is executed by `init`.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware scrapes files containing credentials and uses `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** The malware enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects files from the local system and application directories.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses SCP, Tor hidden services, and SSH for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrates files at regular intervals using Tor hidden services and SSH connections.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Infamous Chisel will perform a SYN flood attack on a host after exfiltrating files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report clearly states that Infamous Chisel exfiltrates files at regular intervals using Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - **SYN Flood Attack:** The report does not mention any SYN flood attack or any other form of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. The focus of the malware seems to be on persistence, privilege escalation, credential access, discovery, collection, and exfiltration of data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the malware's activities, which are primarily focused on maintaining persistence, gaining and maintaining root access, collecting and exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - There is no indication in the report that the malware performs any network-based attacks such as SYN flood attacks.
   - The use of Tor and SSH for exfiltration suggests a focus on stealth and secure data transfer rather than causing disruption through DDoS attacks.
