### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks.
     - They have advanced reconnaissance capabilities, including knowledge of victims' names and places of stay.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - They gain initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates.
     - They also seed Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - They deploy various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers.
     - They use 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
   - **Persistence:**
     - They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:**
     - They use keyloggers and information stealers to collect and encrypt data.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will compromise trusted commercial network resources to support their operations only before performing reconnaissance to gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report clearly states that the Darkhotel APT has advanced reconnaissance capabilities and knowledge of victims' names and places of stay.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - They gain initial access by delivering malware disguised as legitimate software updates.
   - **Compromise of Trusted Commercial Network Resources:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention compromising trusted commercial network resources before performing reconnaissance. Instead, it suggests that reconnaissance is a key initial step in their attack process.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report indicates that reconnaissance is a critical first step, followed by initial access and subsequent actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT's advanced reconnaissance capabilities suggest that they gather detailed knowledge of their victims' whereabouts and travel plans before initiating the attack.
   - The initial access is achieved through malware disguised as legitimate software updates, which is a subsequent step after reconnaissance.
   - Compromising trusted commercial network resources is not mentioned as a step that occurs before reconnaissance in the report.
