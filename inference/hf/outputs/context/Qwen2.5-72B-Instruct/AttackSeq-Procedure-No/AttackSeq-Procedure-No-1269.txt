### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used the SocGholish framework to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update. This led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
   - **Execution:** The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector taken from an open-source project called Donut. This was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use tools such as `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` to perform account discovery before executing the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload using a .NET injector.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report states that the initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, which led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe. This file profiled the computer and downloaded additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
     - The next step was the deployment of Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader containing a .NET injector, which was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Account Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group` for account discovery. However, it does mention that the attackers used Cobalt Strike for credential dumping and to empty log files.
     - The use of these specific tools (`whoami`, `net user`, `net group`) is a common practice in the early stages of an attack to gather information about the system and user accounts, which can help in further stages of the attack, such as privilege escalation and lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of `whoami`, `net user`, and `net group`, it is highly likely that the attackers would use these tools or similar ones to perform account discovery before executing the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload. This is because:
     - Account discovery is a crucial step in understanding the environment and identifying potential targets for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
     - The report mentions the use of Cobalt Strike for credential dumping, which implies that the attackers were interested in gathering account information.
     - The sequence of events described in the report suggests a methodical approach to the attack, where each step builds on the previous one to achieve the final goal of deploying WastedLocker ransomware.
