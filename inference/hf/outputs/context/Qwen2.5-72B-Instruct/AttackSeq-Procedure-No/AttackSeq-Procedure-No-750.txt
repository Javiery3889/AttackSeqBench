### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment activity to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
     - The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
     - The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The macro executed shellcode that downloaded and executed the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - **Others:**
     - The campaign targeted nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies globally.
     - The implant shares similarities with Lazarus Group attacks but may include false flags.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration after performing initial reconnaissance and communicating with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - The report does not mention the use of GitHub for data exfiltration.
     - The control servers used for communication are explicitly listed (34.214.99.20/view_style.php, 137.74.41.56/board.php, and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php).
     - The implant's capabilities include executing commands, gathering drive and process information, reading and writing files, and modifying file attributes, but there is no specific mention of using GitHub for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides detailed information about the communication methods used by the Rising Sun implant, which are HTTP POST requests to specific control servers.
   - The report does not mention GitHub as a method for data exfiltration.
   - Given the specific control servers and the detailed communication methods described, it is less likely that the implant would use GitHub for data exfiltration without it being mentioned in the report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
