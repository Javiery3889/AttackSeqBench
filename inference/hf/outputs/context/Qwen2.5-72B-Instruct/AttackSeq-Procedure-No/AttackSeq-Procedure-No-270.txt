### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are believed to be the initial access vectors.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant via a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating hidden system directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via a custom protocol using TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant uses ICMP in C2 (Command and Control) communications after collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Method:** The report explicitly states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom protocol using TCP messages. There is no mention of ICMP being used for C2 communications.
   - **Data Collection:** The report confirms that the malware collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives, which aligns with the question's context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed description of the exfiltration method, which is clearly stated as using TCP messages.
   - There is no indication or mention of ICMP being used for any part of the C2 communications.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report and the specific mention of TCP, it is reasonable to conclude that ICMP is not used for C2 communications.
