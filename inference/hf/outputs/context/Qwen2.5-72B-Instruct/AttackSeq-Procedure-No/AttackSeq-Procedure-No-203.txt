### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Targeted Ukrainian government entities and military infrastructure.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2021-44026).
     - Used scripts to redirect emails, perform reconnaissance, and exfiltrate session cookies and address books.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained access by exploiting Roundcube mail servers (CVE-2020-35730) and Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397).
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious scripts to redirect emails and perform reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumped OS credentials from compromised systems.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Gathered system information, network configuration, and user discovery.
   - **Collection:**
     - Created a filter in Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated session cookies, address books, and database information over alternative protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign exfiltrated the victim's Roundcube session cookie, address book, and database information only after collecting emails through the creation of a Roundcube managesieve plugin filter.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report states that the BlueDelta campaign exfiltrated session cookies, address books, and database information.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report also states that the campaign created a filter in Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order in which these actions were performed. However, it is logical to assume that the exfiltration of session cookies, address books, and database information could have been part of the initial reconnaissance and exfiltration activities, which could have occurred before or concurrently with the creation of the email filter.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The exfiltration of session cookies, address books, and database information is described as part of the initial reconnaissance and exfiltration activities.
   - The creation of the email filter is described as a method to collect emails.
   - The report does not specify that the exfiltration of session cookies, address books, and database information only occurred after the creation of the email filter.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the exfiltration of session cookies, address books, and database information only occurred after the creation of the email filter.
