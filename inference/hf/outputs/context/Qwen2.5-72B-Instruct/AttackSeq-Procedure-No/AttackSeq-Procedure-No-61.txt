### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events.
   - **Persistence:** Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including hooking APIs, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, and changing file system paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, such as hooking APIs, checking for loaded modules, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, changing file system paths, monitoring hooks, checking for debugging tools, and detecting virtual environments.
   - **Credential Access:** It steals credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro is likely to perform software discovery (collecting information about banking protection software and other installed security products) only after communicating with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Grandoreiro uses a variety of techniques to evade detection, including hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software, checking for loaded modules, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, and changing file system paths. These actions are described as part of its defense evasion tactics, which are likely to be performed as soon as the malware is executed to ensure it can operate undetected.
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that Grandoreiro communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds. However, it does not specify that software discovery is performed only after this communication.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The defense evasion techniques, including software discovery, are critical for the malware to operate undetected and effectively. These actions are likely to be performed as soon as the malware is executed to ensure it can maintain its presence and functionality on the system.
   - The report does not indicate that these actions are delayed until after communication with the C&C server. Instead, it suggests that these actions are part of the initial setup and operation of the malware.
