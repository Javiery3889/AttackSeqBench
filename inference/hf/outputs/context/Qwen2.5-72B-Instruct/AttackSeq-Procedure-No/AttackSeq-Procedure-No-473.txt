### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** It persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` at `/system/bin/netd` and checks if `init` is the parent process.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes files containing credentials and uses `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** It enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network.
   - **Collection:** It collects files from the local system and application directories.
   - **Exfiltration:** It exfiltrates files using Tor hidden services and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel, after leveraging its Command and Control (C2) capabilities, is likely to perform discovery activities like enumerating multiple data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network with the `netd` component.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Capabilities:** The report mentions that Infamous Chisel includes utilities like `scp`, `ssh`, and `dbclient`, which are used for C2 activities.
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report explicitly states that Infamous Chisel's `netd` component enumerates multiple data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **C2 Capabilities:** The malware has the ability to use `scp`, `ssh`, and `dbclient` for C2 activities, which are essential for maintaining control and exfiltrating data.
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report clearly indicates that the `netd` component performs discovery activities, including enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** After establishing C2 capabilities, it is logical for the malware to perform discovery activities to gather information about the system and network, which can be used for further exploitation and exfiltration.
