### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant via a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** The malware creates a hidden directory and sets up persistence through a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated using a custom TCP-based protocol with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, only before it collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration is performed using a custom TCP-based protocol with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.
   - **Initial Handshake:** The report does not explicitly mention an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP before data collection.
   - **Data Collection:** The report clearly states that the malware collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms that the Korplug variant uses a custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration.
   - However, the report does not mention an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP before data collection.
   - The sequence of events described in the report suggests that data collection occurs before exfiltration, but it does not specify an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The report does not provide evidence that the Korplug variant performs an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP before collecting data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. Therefore, the correct answer is "No."
