### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Gamaredon group uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, leveraging trusted relationships by abusing compromised organization's email accounts.
   - **Execution:** They use scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** They register modules as scheduled tasks, use Registry Run keys, the Startup folder, and insert malicious macros into existing documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use obfuscation, modify registry keys, employ code signing, and deobfuscate/decrypt strings.
   - **Discovery:** Their backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and use Outlook VBA macros to spread to other targets.
   - **Command and Control:** They use HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Their modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon is likely to collect files from various information repositories before automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also states that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report suggests that after listing interesting files, the group collects and uploads them to the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** The backdoors list interesting files (Discovery).
   - **Step 2:** The modules collect these files (implied by the listing for future exfiltration).
   - **Step 3:** The modules automatically upload the collected files to the C&C server (Exfiltration).

Given the sequence of actions described in the report, it is clear that Gamaredon does collect files from various information repositories (listed interesting files) before uploading them to the C&C server.
