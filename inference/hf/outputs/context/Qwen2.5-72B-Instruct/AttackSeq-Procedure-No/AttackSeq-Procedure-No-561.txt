### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold by being selective and careful.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers were able to move through the network.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 and T1568 for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers used Defense Evasion techniques (T1036 Masquerading and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls) only after employing Discovery techniques (T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry).

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques (T1036 and T1553):** The report clearly states that the attackers used these techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery Techniques (T1057 and T1012):** The report does not explicitly mention these techniques, but it is common for attackers to use Discovery techniques to understand the environment before evading defenses.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** The question implies a specific sequence where Discovery techniques are used before Defense Evasion techniques. However, the report does not provide a clear sequence of these specific techniques.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers were highly sophisticated and focused on avoiding detection. They likely used Defense Evasion techniques early in the attack to minimize the risk of being detected.
   - **Discovery:** While Discovery techniques are important, they are not necessarily a prerequisite for Defense Evasion. The attackers could have used Defense Evasion techniques as soon as they gained initial access to avoid detection.
   - **Common Attack Patterns:** In many sophisticated attacks, attackers often use Defense Evasion techniques as soon as they gain access to the network to ensure they can operate undetected. Discovery techniques are typically used to gather information about the environment, but they are not always a strict prerequisite for Defense Evasion.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The attackers likely used Defense Evasion techniques early in the attack to avoid detection, rather than waiting to use Discovery techniques first.
