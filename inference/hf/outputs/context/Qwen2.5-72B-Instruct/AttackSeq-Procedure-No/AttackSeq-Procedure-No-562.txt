### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names. This indicates a high level of reconnaissance.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains for future use.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold by being selective and careful to avoid detection.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high system access, implying the use of privilege escalation techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers were able to move through the network to reach their objectives.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 and T1568 for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the SolarWinds attackers would have identified the geographical location of a victim host before employing T1057 Process Discovery and T1012 Query Registry as part of their Discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report emphasizes the attackers' extensive reconnaissance capabilities, including knowledge of network topology and internal domain names. This suggests a high level of pre-attack preparation.
   - **Discovery:** The techniques T1057 (Process Discovery) and T1012 (Query Registry) are part of the Discovery phase, where attackers gather information about the system and network to plan further actions.
   - **Geographical Location:** The report does not explicitly mention the identification of the geographical location of victim hosts. However, given the attackers' sophisticated nature and the importance of understanding the network environment, it is plausible that they would have gathered such information as part of their reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers demonstrated a high level of sophistication and preparation.
   - They had detailed knowledge of the network topology and internal domain names, indicating thorough reconnaissance.
   - While the report does not explicitly state the identification of geographical locations, it is reasonable to infer that such information would be valuable for planning and executing the attack.
   - The use of T1057 and T1012 in the Discovery phase suggests that the attackers were methodical in gathering information about the system and network.
