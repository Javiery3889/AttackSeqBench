### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email campaign that delivered a URL leading to an IP-address-based URL containing an executable and a decoy PDF.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor, executed commands, and downloaded additional malware.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking and registry keys were used for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Files and processes were deleted and security tools were disabled.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumpers were used to target browsers and Microsoft Outlook for credential retrieval.
   - **Discovery:** Information about the victim's computer and environment was gathered, including registry key enumeration and listing running processes.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server used common ports and encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were prepared with file paths and sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group's malware is likely to stage archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server before preparing the staged data for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment, including registry key enumeration and listing running processes.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data were prepared with file paths and sent to the C&C server, but it does not mention staging data on an OWA server.
   - **Context:** The report focuses on the use of C&C servers for exfiltration and does not indicate any use of OWA servers for staging data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly outlines the steps taken by the Sednit group, including the use of C&C servers for exfiltration.
   - There is no mention of using OWA servers for staging data before exfiltration.
   - The exfiltration process described in the report involves preparing data with file paths and sending it directly to the C&C server.
