### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file.
- The document contains encrypted script data and an external template.
- The external template is downloaded via URL shortening services and redirects to a domain controlled by the attacker.
- The VBA code in the external template decrypts the embedded data and drops it into two files: 'fmx.ps1' (PowerShell script) and 'sdmc.jpg' (base64 encoded PowerShell code).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers switch the malicious external template to a benign one after a certain amount of time.
- The malware payload is concealed using image files.
- The final Bandook payload is signed with valid certificates to appear trustworthy.

**Command and Control:**
- The Bandook loader uses Process Hollowing to inject a malicious payload into a new instance of an Internet Explorer process.
- The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic information, and awaits further commands.
- The communication protocol uses AES encryption.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering a malicious Microsoft Word document inside a ZIP file to achieve initial access, is it likely that the 'fmx.ps1' PowerShell script will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload only before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script stored in 'sdmc.jpg'?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malicious Word document inside a ZIP file.
   - External template downloaded via URL shortening services.
   - VBA code decrypts embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg'.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Malicious template switched to benign after a certain time.
   - Payload concealed using image files.
   - Payload signed with valid certificates.

3. **Command and Control:**
   - Process Hollowing to inject payload into Internet Explorer.
   - Communication with C&C server using AES encryption.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This suggests that 'fmx.ps1' will download a zip file containing components for the malware payload before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.
  - The CTI report does not mention any additional download of a zip file by 'fmx.ps1'. It only states that 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' are dropped by the VBA code and that 'sdmc.jpg' contains base64 encoded PowerShell code.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This suggests that 'fmx.ps1' will not download a zip file containing components for the malware payload before decoding and executing the base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg'.
  - The CTI report clearly states that the VBA code decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' directly. There is no mention of 'fmx.ps1' downloading any additional zip file.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not indicate that 'fmx.ps1' downloads any additional zip file.
- The report states that the VBA code in the external template decrypts the embedded data and drops 'fmx.ps1' and 'sdmc.jpg' directly.
- The base64 encoded script in 'sdmc.jpg' is the primary payload component, and there is no mention of an additional download step.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
