### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The 'Recon' module group collects general information about the target system, including browser history, cached credentials, and FTP client settings.
     - The 'RegConn' module gathers system-related information and sends encrypted data to C&C servers.
     - The 'Wnhttp' module checks Internet connectivity and obtains the external IP address.
     - The 'Sysinfo' module collects a range of information and sends it to the C&C server.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The 'Persistence' module group plants a plugin in popular applications to regain access if control is lost.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The 'Spreading' module group scans for other hosts on the network, fingerprints them, and infects them via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.
     - It can also dump Cisco network router configuration via SNMP commands and an embedded TFTP server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The 'Exfiltration' module group transfers collected data to the C&C server.
   - **Others:**
     - The 'Mobile' module group dumps information from mobile devices.
     - The 'USBInfection' group copies data from USB drives but does not infect them.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the 'Spreading' module group is likely to attempt to infect other hosts on the network via MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials before the 'Password' module group is used to steal credentials from various applications and resources.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The 'Recon' module group is the first to be deployed to gather initial system information.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The 'Spreading' module group is designed to scan for other hosts on the network and infect them using MS08-067 or stolen admin credentials.
   - **Password Stealing:**
     - The 'Password' module group is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but the 'Recon' module group does collect browser cached credentials and FTP client settings, which can be considered a form of password stealing.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The 'Recon' module group is deployed first to gather initial information.
     - The 'Spreading' module group is then used to infect other hosts on the network.
     - The 'Password' module group, if it exists, would likely be used after the initial reconnaissance and before or during the lateral movement to ensure the attacker has the necessary credentials to infect other hosts.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The 'Recon' module group is the initial step to gather information.
   - The 'Spreading' module group is the next logical step to expand the attack to other hosts on the network.
   - The 'Password' module group, if it exists, would be used to gather additional credentials to facilitate the spreading process.
