### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious delivery documents with Tajik language text and file names.
- Social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
- Payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded from the internet.
- A separate lure with a Java key generator and Java downloader.

**Execution:**
- Macros are enabled, and the payload executes.
- Two files are created in the ProgramData directory in randomly-named directories.
- A VBS script is used to execute a PowerShell script.
- The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- In some campaigns, two files are dropped: a VBS script and a base64 encoded text file.
- The latest change drops three files: an .sct scriptlet file, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file.
- The scriptlet and inf files use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.
- The PowerShell script is obfuscated and divided into three parts: global variables, encryption functions, and the backdoor function.

**Persistence:**
- The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler.

**Discovery:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Collection:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Command and Control:**
- Communication with the C&C server via XML messages.
- The backdoor queries the internet for the machine's IP address and location.
- The communication is encrypted using a simple RSA algorithm.

**Others:**
- Attackers monitor incoming connections to the C&C server.
- False flags and error messages in simplified Mandarin Chinese are embedded in the PowerShell script.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After macros are enabled leading to file execution in randomly named directories during Execution, is it likely that payloads are delivered through malicious documents in Initial Access only after campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Initial Access:** Malicious documents are used to deliver the payload.
- **Execution:** Macros are enabled, leading to the execution of the payload.
- **Defense Evasion:** The latest change includes the use of publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

**Analysis:**
- The report clearly states that the initial access is through malicious documents that trick victims into enabling macros.
- The execution phase involves the creation of files in randomly named directories.
- The latest change in the campaign includes the use of publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker, which is a defense evasion tactic.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that payloads are delivered through malicious documents only after the campaign uses obfuscation and tools for bypassing AppLocker.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that payloads are not delivered through malicious documents only after the campaign uses obfuscation and tools for bypassing AppLocker.

**Reasoning:**
- The report indicates that the initial access is through malicious documents, and the execution phase involves enabling macros and creating files in randomly named directories.
- The use of publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker is mentioned as a recent change, but it does not imply that payloads were not delivered through malicious documents before this change.
- Therefore, the payloads are delivered through malicious documents regardless of whether the campaign uses obfuscation and tools for bypassing AppLocker.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
