### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
- Targets were defense and government-related organizations.

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
- The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
- The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.

**Execution:**
- The shellcode executed by the macro in winword.exe downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
- The payloads were executed using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

**Persistence:**
- The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

**Discovery:**
- The Rising Sun implant collected network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
- Additional information was decrypted during the reconnaissance process.

**Exfiltration:**
- The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding.
- Data was exfiltrated to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

**Others:**
- The implant shares similarities with Lazarus Group attacks but may include false flags.
- The campaign targeted nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies globally, predominantly in the United States.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with C2 using blogs and WordPress for bidirectional communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
- The report does not mention the use of blogs or WordPress for communication.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - The report does not provide any evidence that the Rising Sun implant used blogs or WordPress for bidirectional communication.
  - The exfiltration method described is via HTTP POST requests to a control server.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice aligns with the information provided in the report.
  - The report clearly states that the implant used HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, not blogs or WordPress.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data using HTTP POST requests to a control server.
- There is no mention of blogs or WordPress being used for communication.
- The information provided in the report does not support the use of blogs or WordPress for bidirectional communication.

**Final Answer:**
- B: No
