### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The adversaries used weaponized exploit documents to gain initial access, exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2012-0158.
     - A spear-phishing email was sent containing a malicious document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The BBSRAT malware is executed, and it writes files to the %TEMP% directory.
     - It uses the expand.exe utility to write files to the SSONSVR directory.
     - The malware performs process hollowing to inject a malicious DLL into a suspended instance of msiexec.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - A registry key is written to run ssonsvr.exe on startup.
     - A downloader deploys a DLL to specific directories with corresponding registry keys.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - BBSRAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests.
     - It exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely to observe the malware first exfiltrating data about the victim's machine and then establishing command and control communication through HTTP or HTTPS requests with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Data:**
     - The CTI report states that BBSRAT exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.
   - **Command and Control Communication:**
     - The report also mentions that BBSRAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions. However, it is common for malware to first establish a connection with the C2 server and then exfiltrate data. This is because the C2 server needs to be contacted to send commands or receive instructions before data exfiltration can occur.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The malware gains initial access and executes, setting up the necessary files and processes.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware ensures persistence by writing registry keys.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware establishes a connection with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests.
   - **Data Exfiltration:**
     - Once the connection is established, the malware exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.

Given the typical sequence of operations for malware, it is more likely that the malware would first establish command and control communication and then exfiltrate data. This is because the C2 server needs to be contacted to send commands or receive instructions before data exfiltration can occur.

### Final Answer
