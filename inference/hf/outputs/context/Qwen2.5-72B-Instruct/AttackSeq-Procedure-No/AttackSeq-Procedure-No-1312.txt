### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email.
- The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

**Execution:**
- Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- Additional variants of Pterodo were executed on July 16.
- A VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload on July 28.

**Persistence:**
- Shuckworm established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes.
- These tasks ensured that their backdoor would remain active even after system reboots.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Shuckworm utilized mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
- They used scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection and maintain their foothold.

**Collection:**
- Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.
- It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has been tracking Shuckworm's activities.
- Shuckworm has been active since at least 2013 and has increased the sophistication of their attacks.
- They use living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally.
- Seven files used by Shuckworm were identified, including VBS files, a VNC client, and a Process Explorer binary.
- IOCs showed patterns such as C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers and malicious files in specific directories.
- The SSU report attributed over 5,000 attacks to Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, is Shuckworm likely to deploy software such as the GOGETTER tunneler to establish a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel before using downloaded payloads to maintain control over compromised systems?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Shuckworm uses a variety of techniques to maintain control over compromised systems, including VBS scripts, scheduled tasks, and a VNC client.
- They use living-off-the-land tools and sophisticated methods to evade detection.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of GOGETTER or Yamux.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not provide any specific information about Shuckworm using GOGETTER or establishing a "Yamux" TLS-based C2 channel.
- The report focuses on the use of VBS scripts, scheduled tasks, and a VNC client for maintaining control.
- While Shuckworm is known for increasing the sophistication of their attacks, the report does not indicate the use of the specific tools mentioned in the question.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not mention the use of GOGETTER or Yamux.
- The report focuses on the use of VBS scripts, scheduled tasks, and a VNC client for maintaining control.
- While Shuckworm is known for sophisticated attacks, the specific tools mentioned in the question are not part of the reported attack sequence.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
