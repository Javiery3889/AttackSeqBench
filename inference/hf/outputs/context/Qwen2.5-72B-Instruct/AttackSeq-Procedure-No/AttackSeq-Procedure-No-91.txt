### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Executes via a service (T1569.002)
- Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)

**Persistence:**
- Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)

**Defense Evasion:**
- Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
- Can timestomp files (T1070.006)
- Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
- Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
- Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)

**Discovery:**
- Obtains file and directory listings (T1083)
- Lists running processes (T1057)
- Obtains system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, and architecture (T1082)
- Obtains the local IP address (T1016)
- Obtains system time and time zone (T1124)

**Command and Control:**
- Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
- Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
- Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

**Exfiltration:**
- Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)

**Others:**
- Targeted deployment, shares code similarities with NukeSped, and has been active since December 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Vyveva's backdoor is likely to collect files from newly inserted removable media and notify the C&C about these files only after obtaining information such as the local IP address and system time through discovery.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Discovery:** Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), list running processes (T1057), obtain system information (T1082), obtain the local IP address (T1016), and obtain system time and time zone (T1124).
- **Exfiltration:** Vyveva exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041).

**Analysis:**
- The report does not explicitly mention that Vyveva collects files from newly inserted removable media.
- The report does mention that Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), which could include files from removable media, but it does not specify that it specifically targets newly inserted removable media.
- The report does state that Vyveva obtains the local IP address (T1016) and system time (T1124) as part of its discovery process.
- The report also states that Vyveva exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041).

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that Vyveva specifically targets newly inserted removable media and only notifies the C&C after obtaining the local IP address and system time. The report does not provide evidence to support this specific sequence.
- **B: No** - This would imply that Vyveva does not specifically target newly inserted removable media or that it does not wait to notify the C&C after obtaining the local IP address and system time. The report does not provide evidence to support the specific sequence described in option A.

#### 4. Final Answer

Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
