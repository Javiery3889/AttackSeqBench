### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
- The attack resembles previous attacks against the global financial network SWIFT.

**Initial Access:**
- Financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails.
- The emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).

**Execution:**
- The Bankshot implant is attached to the malicious Word document (Agreement.docx).
- The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.

**Persistence:**
- Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Bankshot implant is designed to evade detection and can wipe files and content from the targeted system.

**Command and Control:**
- The implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.

**Others:**
- The campaign is successful against unpatched Flash versions.
- Documents with the Flash exploit evaded static defenses and remained undetected on VirusTotal.
- This is the first time Bankshot has been tied directly to financial-related hacking and used since November 2017.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After developing the Bankshot implants with capabilities to give attackers full control over victim systems and wipe files from the targeted system under the tactic of Resource Development, is it likely that Hidden Cobra will target Turkish financial organizations via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2018-4878 for gaining initial access?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
