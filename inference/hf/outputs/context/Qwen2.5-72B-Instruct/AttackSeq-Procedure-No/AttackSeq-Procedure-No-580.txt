### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN8 uses BADHATCH v2.14 to gain initial access.
     - BADHATCH downloads and executes a script from a domain mapped by sslip.io.
     - The script uses base64 representations of shellcode and a .NET binary to execute in memory.
   - **Execution:**
     - BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
     - POWERSHELL mode uses IEX to execute commands from a pipe.
     - CMD mode uses cmd.exe to execute commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - WMI event subscription mechanism is used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is achieved using a script (sh-tmp.ps1) and SYSTEM token.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TLS encryption and masquerading as legitimate HTTP requests.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Credential dumping using a script (mimi.ps1) and reading lsass.exe memory.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement to the Domain Controller using wmic.exe and wmiexec.py.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use commands such as `net user` or `net user /domain` to enumerate local accounts before conducting domain trust discovery using tools such as `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report confirms that BADHATCH is used to gain initial access and execute commands in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report mentions privilege escalation, which is necessary for accessing domain-level information.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report indicates credential dumping, which is a common step before domain trust discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report mentions lateral movement to the Domain Controller, which suggests the attackers are interested in domain-level information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Enumerating Local Accounts:**
     - Using `net user` or `net user /domain` to enumerate local accounts is a common step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. It helps the attackers understand the environment and identify potential targets for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
   - **Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - Tools like `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` are used to discover domain trusts, which is a logical next step after enumerating local accounts and gaining domain-level access.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence of actions described in the question (enumerating local accounts before domain trust discovery) aligns with the typical attack flow described in the CTI report.
