### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is delivered via an SFX executable that displays a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** The malware checks the installed input language, decrypts an embedded resource, sets up a scheduled task, and collects system information.
   - **Persistence:** The malware sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses ConfuserEx for obfuscation and checks for anti-virus software.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system information using WMI queries.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and WSHttpBinding() API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether VERMIN will use tools to capture mouse movements instead of storing keystrokes and clipboard data encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Collection:** The report states that VERMIN collects various information from the infected machine, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and installed anti-virus software using WMI queries.
   - **Keylogger Component:** The report mentions that if any anti-virus is detected, the malware does not install its keylogger component. However, it does not mention any functionality related to capturing mouse movements.
   - **Storage Location:** The report specifies that the malware saves and encrypts parameters to a predefined location: `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`. This location is different from `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the malware collects system information using WMI queries.
   - The malware has a keylogger component, but it is not installed if anti-virus software is detected.
   - The report does not mention any functionality related to capturing mouse movements.
   - The storage location for the collected parameters is specified as `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`, which is different from `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
