### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** BlueBravo uses compromised infrastructure, third-party services, and legitimate internet services (LIS) for C2.
   - **Initial Access:** Malware is delivered through spearphishing emails with malicious links, leading to compromised websites that use scripts or HTML smuggling.
   - **Execution:** Malware acts as loaders with C2 functionality and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Persistence:** Malware is copied to a directory and registry run keys are created for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques are used, including obfuscation, dynamic API resolution, masquerading, and DLL hijacking.
   - **Discovery:** Malware gathers victim system information, including username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a list of running processes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information only after using HTTPS for C2 communication and Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communication:** The report mentions that BlueBravo uses HTTPS for C2 communication and legitimate services like OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that BlueBravo's malware gathers victim system information, but it does not specify the exact timing of this action relative to C2 communication.
   - **Logical Sequence:** Typically, malware would gather system information as soon as it gains initial access to the system to understand the environment and plan further actions. This information is crucial for the malware to function effectively and communicate with the C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that the malware gathers system information only after establishing C2 communication.
   - Given the nature of malware, it is more likely that the malware would gather system information as soon as it executes to ensure it has the necessary data to communicate with the C2 server and perform its tasks.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the malware would wait to gather system information only after establishing C2 communication.

### Final Answer
