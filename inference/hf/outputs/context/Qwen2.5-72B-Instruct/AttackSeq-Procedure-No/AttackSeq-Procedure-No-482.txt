### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method after utilizing SparrowDoor to communicate with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control:** The report confirms that SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:** The report states that SparrowDoor can read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server. However, it does not specify the frequency or method of exfiltration.
   - **Scheduled Transfer:** The report does not mention any specific scheduled transfer method or frequency for data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides detailed information about the communication and exfiltration capabilities of SparrowDoor.
   - However, it does not provide any information about a scheduled transfer method or a specific frequency (e.g., every 10 minutes) for data exfiltration.
   - Given the lack of specific details about the frequency and method of exfiltration, it is not possible to conclude that FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data every 10 minutes using a scheduled transfer method.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
