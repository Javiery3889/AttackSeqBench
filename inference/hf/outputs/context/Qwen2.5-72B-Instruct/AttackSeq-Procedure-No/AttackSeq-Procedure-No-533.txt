### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities using spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Initial Access:** They use spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and watering hole attacks with malicious PowerPoint documents.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals and uses resilient communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the backdoor, after stealing the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data, is likely to upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to collect them.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report explicitly states that the backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals, indicating ongoing communication with the C2 server.
   - **File Collection and Upload:** The report does not explicitly mention the sequence of uploading collected files with specific extensions before iterating through directories. However, it is common for malware to collect and upload files in a structured manner to ensure efficiency and completeness of data exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor's primary function is to steal credentials and other data, which suggests that it is designed to exfiltrate this data to the C2 server.
   - The use of encoded blobs and PowerShell scripts for downloading additional malware indicates a sophisticated and multi-stage attack.
   - Given the sophistication of the attack, it is plausible that the backdoor would upload collected files with specific extensions to the C2 server before iterating through directories to ensure that critical data is exfiltrated first.
