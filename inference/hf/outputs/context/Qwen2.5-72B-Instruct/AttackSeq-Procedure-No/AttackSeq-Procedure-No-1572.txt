### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms and hijacking execution flow.
   - **Credential Access:** They used tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process and obtain credential hashes. They also exploited the domain controller using the ZeroLogon exploit and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.
   - **Collection:** They collected data and used WinRAR and megacmd for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca used `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques before targeting user credentials using tools like procdump to dump the lsass process memory and retrieve credential hashes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the Report:**
     - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used tools like procdump to dump the memory of the lsass process and obtain credential hashes.
     - **Execution and Persistence:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques. However, it does mention the use of command and scripting interpreters and scheduling tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
     - **Choice A: Yes**
       - The report does not provide direct evidence that Earth Lusca used `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques. While they used various methods to execute and maintain persistence, the specific use of `regsvr32.exe` is not mentioned.
     - **Choice B: No**
       - The report does not provide any evidence that Earth Lusca used `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques. The focus is on other methods for execution and persistence.

### Final Answer
Based on the information provided in the CTI report, there is no evidence that Earth Lusca used `regsvr32.exe` to bypass application control techniques. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
