### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory.
- PowerShell scripts persist on the system by:
  - Using WMI event subscriptions.
  - Modifying the PowerShell profile (profile.ps1 file).

**Persistence:**
- WMI event filters and consumers execute base64-encoded PowerShell commands.
- PowerShell profile runs a script on startup to load and execute malware.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Payloads are encrypted and scripts are obfuscated.
- AMSI bypass technique is used to patch the AmsiScanBuffer function.

**Discovery:**
- Turla uses RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor for lateral movement and control.
- RPC backdoor supports plugins for file and directory information and USB drive monitoring.
- PowerStallion monitors antimalware logs and the Windows process list.

**Collection:**
- RPC backdoor plugins collect recent files and files from USB drives.
- PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive for command and control and can execute additional PowerShell scripts, writing command results to another OneDrive subfolder.

**Command and Control:**
- RPC backdoor uses the RPC protocol.
- PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive via SMB.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing the RPC protocol and Microsoft OneDrive as command and control channels, is it likely that PowerStallion will exfiltrate collected data via HTTPS?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive for command and control.
- PowerStallion can execute additional PowerShell scripts and write command results to another OneDrive subfolder.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive for command and control.
- It also mentions that PowerStallion can write command results to another OneDrive subfolder, indicating that data exfiltration is done through OneDrive.
- There is no mention of PowerStallion using HTTPS for exfiltration.

**Reasoning:**
- Given that PowerStallion is designed to use OneDrive for both command and control and data exfiltration, it is unlikely that it would switch to HTTPS for exfiltration.
- The use of OneDrive for exfiltration is more consistent with the described behavior and infrastructure of PowerStallion.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**
