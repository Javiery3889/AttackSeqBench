### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla spyware has been infecting government computers, suggesting an Initial Access tactic.
   - **Persistence:** The malware establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks, allowing the attackers to maintain persistent access. This foothold enables them to search other computers, store stolen information, and transmit data back to their servers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Turla uses encryption to evade defenses, hides its tracks, and maintains control of infected networks. It includes a rootkit that conceals the spying operation and creates a hidden, encrypted file system to store stolen data and tools.
   - **Command and Control:** Turla uses multiple command and control servers located in various countries to control infected systems. The code is regularly updated to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Turla operators will set auto-forward rules on victims' e-mail accounts to collect data before updating command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Data Collection:** The report mentions that Turla establishes a hidden foothold to search other computers and store stolen information. This aligns with the idea of maintaining persistent access and collecting data.
   - **Command and Control:** The report also states that Turla uses multiple command and control servers and regularly updates the code to avoid detection. This aligns with the idea of maintaining control of infected systems.
   - **Auto-Forward Rules:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of auto-forward rules on victims' e-mail accounts. However, given the sophisticated nature of Turla and its focus on data collection and persistence, it is plausible that such a tactic could be used to further enhance data exfiltration and maintain control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence and Data Collection:** The malware's ability to maintain a hidden foothold and store stolen information suggests a high level of sophistication and a focus on long-term data collection.
   - **Command and Control:** The use of multiple command and control servers and regular code updates indicates a well-organized and adaptive approach to maintaining control.
   - **Plausibility of Auto-Forward Rules:** While not explicitly mentioned, the use of auto-forward rules is a common tactic in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to ensure continuous data exfiltration. Given Turla's sophisticated nature, it is reasonable to assume that such a tactic could be employed.
