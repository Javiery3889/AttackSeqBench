### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services (Gmail, Google Drive) and Instagram.
- These websites were hosted on servers provided by BelCloud Hosting Corporation in Bulgaria.
- The attackers switched servers after a month of campaign operations.

**Initial Access:**
- The campaign's first stage involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists.
- The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities.
- In August 2019, the group expanded its activities to target influential public figures worldwide.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Charming Kitten used email trackers to monitor whether their phishing emails were forwarded and to collect victims' geolocation and IP addresses.
- They also used a cookie installed on the victim's machine to gather data.

**Credential Access:**
- The attackers created phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services to steal credentials from victims.
- These websites were part of the campaign's second stage, which likely aimed at data theft.

**Command and Control:**
- Charming Kitten used more than six unique servers to host their fake websites.
- Four servers impersonated entities, and two impersonated Google services.
- The servers were used to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.

**Others:**
- ClearSky Security Ltd. attributed the campaign to Charming Kitten based on specific websites linked in the attack, the targeting of non-Iranian investigators, and the impersonation of NIAC.
- The group's activity was tied to Iran through the NetBlock of the IP addresses of the original servers, which included an Iranian company's website.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists during the Reconnaissance phase, is it likely that they created fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram to obtain credentials only during the Resource Development phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance Phase:**
- Charming Kitten targeted non-Iranian researchers by impersonating well-known researchers or journalists.

**Resource Development Phase:**
- Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.

**Initial Access Phase:**
- The campaign's first stage involved sending socially engineered email messages impersonating known researchers or journalists.
- The second stage redirected victims to decoy websites impersonating Google services and other entities.

**Credential Access Phase:**
- The attackers created phishing websites impersonating Instagram and Google services to steal credentials from victims.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report indicates that the creation of fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram was part of the second stage of the campaign, which is described under the **Initial Access** phase.
- The **Resource Development** phase is primarily about setting up the infrastructure (fake websites, servers) but does not explicitly state that the fake websites were used to obtain credentials at this stage.
- The **Credential Access** phase clearly states that the fake websites were used to steal credentials, which aligns with the second stage of the campaign.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The creation of fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram was part of the **Initial Access** phase, not the **Resource Development** phase.
- The **Resource Development** phase involved setting up the infrastructure, while the **Initial Access** phase involved using these fake websites to redirect victims and the **Credential Access** phase involved stealing credentials.

**Final Answer: B: No**
