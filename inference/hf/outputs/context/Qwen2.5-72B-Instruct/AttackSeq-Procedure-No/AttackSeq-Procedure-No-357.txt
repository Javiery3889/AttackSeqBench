### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system (Windows) to install the Nidiran back door.
   - **Execution:** Suckfly used the Nidiran back door and hacktools to infect internal hosts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Suckfly made its malware difficult to analyze and used encrypted communication.
   - **Credential Access:** Suckfly used a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain the victim's account credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Suckfly scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports (8080, 5900, 40).
   - **Command and Control:** Suckfly's Nidiran back door communicated with the C&C domains, sending network details.
   - **Exfiltration:** Suckfly exfiltrated data using the Nidiran back door.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Suckfly will scan the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports after the Nidiran back door communicates the victim’s network details to the C&C domains.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence in the CTI Report:**
     1. **Command and Control:** Nidiran back door communicates with C&C domains.
     2. **Discovery:** Suckfly scans the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.
   - **Sequence in the Question:**
     1. **Command and Control:** Nidiran back door communicates with C&C domains.
     2. **Discovery:** Suckfly scans the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.

   The sequence in the CTI report matches the sequence in the question. After the Nidiran back door communicates the victim’s network details to the C&C domains, Suckfly indeed scans the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report supports the likelihood that Suckfly will scan the corporate internal network for hosts with specific open ports after the Nidiran back door communicates the victim’s network details to the C&C domains.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
