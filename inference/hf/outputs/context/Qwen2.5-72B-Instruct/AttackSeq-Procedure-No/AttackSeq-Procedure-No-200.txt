### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Web Service Compromise:** Attackers target self-hosted web services to gain initial access.
- **Spearphishing:** Use of spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver "GreyEnergy mini."

**Post-Initial Access:**
- **Network Mapping:** Use of Nmap to map the network.
- **Credential Collection:** Use of Mimikatz to collect passwords.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Obtain domain administrator privileges to control the network.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, will the GreyEnergy group use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Web service compromise or spearphishing with malicious attachments.
2. **Execution:**
   - Delivery of "GreyEnergy mini."
3. **Discovery:**
   - Use of Nmap to map the network.
4. **Credential Access:**
   - Use of Mimikatz to collect passwords.
5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Obtain domain administrator privileges.
6. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Control the network with domain administrator privileges.

**Critical Context:**
- The report does not mention the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - The report does not provide any evidence that the GreyEnergy group uses PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker. The tools mentioned are Nmap and Mimikatz, which are used for network mapping and credential collection, respectively.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice aligns with the information provided in the report. The report does not indicate the use of PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker in the attack sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the use of Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.
- The report does not mention PDQ Deploy or AvosLocker.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the GreyEnergy group does not use PDQ Deploy to move AvosLocker and tools across the network based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: B: No**
