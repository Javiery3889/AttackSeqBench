### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access and performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 uses tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools after identifying systems of interest and using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The CTI report clearly states that APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Staging Data:** The report mentions that APT10 uses compression tools to stage data for exfiltration.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence of actions described in the question (identifying systems of interest, using remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools, and then conducting internal reconnaissance) aligns with the typical behavior of APT10. However, the report does not explicitly state the order of these actions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT10's typical behavior includes conducting internal reconnaissance to map out the network, which is a crucial step in understanding the network topology and identifying valuable targets.
   - The use of remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data is a later stage in the attack, typically after the actor has already gained a foothold and mapped out the network.
   - Therefore, it is logical to assume that APT10 would have already conducted internal reconnaissance before staging data for exfiltration.
