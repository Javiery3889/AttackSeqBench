### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which then decrypt and execute the actual Machete malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks, use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating processes, gathering browser data, and keylogger information.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication, with HTTP as a fallback for exfiltration if FTP is unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Machete used SMTPS to exfiltrate collected data before using FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report clearly states that Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes.
   - **Command and Control:** The report specifies that Machete used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers and used HTTP as a fallback for exfiltration if FTP was unavailable.
   - **SMTPS:** The report does not mention the use of SMTPS for exfiltration. The primary methods of exfiltration and C&C communication are FTP and HTTP.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the methods used for data collection and exfiltration.
   - The report explicitly states that Machete used FTP and HTTP for exfiltration and C&C communication.
   - There is no mention of SMTPS being used for exfiltration in the report.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report and the specific mention of FTP and HTTP, it is unlikely that Machete used SMTPS for exfiltration before using FTP and HTTP.
