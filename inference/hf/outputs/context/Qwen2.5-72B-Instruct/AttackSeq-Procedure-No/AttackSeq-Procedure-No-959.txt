### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities like `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` were used for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened malicious documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using `sc.exe` and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders and removed from the file system.
     - `rundll32.exe` was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware used HTTP to connect to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus Group is likely to collect information about accounts using the `net user` utility only after using tools like `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions that the attackers used `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report states that the attackers created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes and services.
   - **Information Collection:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order in which the attackers used `net user` to collect account information. However, it is logical to assume that after gaining initial access and escalating privileges, the attackers would use various tools to gather more information about the network and accounts.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe` for reconnaissance is a common initial step to understand the network topology.
   - After gaining initial access and escalating privileges, it is reasonable to assume that the attackers would use `net user` to gather information about accounts.
   - The report does not provide a strict sequence, but the logical flow of the attack suggests that reconnaissance (using `ipconfig.exe` and `ping.exe`) would precede the collection of account information (using `net user`).
