### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The 'yty' framework uses a malicious Excel document named 'Circular.xls' with macros to execute an embedded executable.
   - **Execution:**
     - The framework includes two downloaders: a stripped-down C++ program (Downloader 1) and a more functional downloader (Downloader 2) with anti-sandbox detection.
   - **Persistence:**
     - A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' ensures persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The framework uses junk code, anti-sandbox detection, and creates logs for debugging.
   - **Collection:**
     - The framework collects files, takes screenshots, and logs keystrokes using plugins like 'vstservice.exe', 'abode.exe', 'mdriver.exe', 'dspcheck.exe', and 'mboard.exe'.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise C2 traffic. It downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host and sends beacon messages containing system information. The C2 server responds with further instructions.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the 'yty' framework is likely to disguise its C2 communication using a football-themed strategy after exfiltrating data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report clearly states that the 'yty' framework uses plugins like 'abode.exe' for file exfiltration, 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging, and 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report also explicitly mentions that the 'yty' framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise its C2 traffic. It downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host and sends beacon messages containing system information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the 'yty' framework's operations, including data exfiltration and C2 communication.
   - The report specifically mentions that the framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise its C2 traffic.
   - Given that the framework is designed to exfiltrate data and then communicate with the C2 server, it is highly likely that the C2 communication will be disguised using the football-themed strategy to avoid detection.
