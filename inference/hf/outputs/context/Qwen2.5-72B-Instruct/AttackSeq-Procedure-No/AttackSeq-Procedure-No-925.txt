### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Emissary Panda identified systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 using tools.

**Initial Access:**
- Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.

**Execution:**
- Uploaded tools like Mimikatz and custom backdoors such as HyperBro.

**Persistence:**
- Installed webshells (Antak, China Chopper variants) for persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and maintained access with China Chopper.

**Credential Access:**
- Used Mimikatz to dump credentials.

**Discovery:**
- Performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information.

**Command and Control:**
- Used the HyperBro backdoor for C2 over HTTPS.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that Emissary Panda used stolen credentials to perform lateral movement across the network **only** before using tools for network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Credential Access:** The report states that Emissary Panda used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
- **Discovery:** The report mentions that the threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems and gather information.
- **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly state the order of lateral movement and network reconnaissance. However, it is common in cyber attacks for threat actors to use stolen credentials to move laterally and then perform network reconnaissance to gather more information and identify additional targets.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Step 1:** Emissary Panda gained initial access and installed webshells.
- **Step 2:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
- **Step 3:** They likely used these credentials to move laterally within the network.
- **Step 4:** After gaining access to additional systems, they performed network reconnaissance to identify more vulnerable systems and gather information.

The question asks if it is likely that they used stolen credentials to perform lateral movement **only** before network reconnaissance. The report does not explicitly state this sequence, but it is more plausible that they used stolen credentials to move laterally and then performed network reconnaissance to gather more information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
