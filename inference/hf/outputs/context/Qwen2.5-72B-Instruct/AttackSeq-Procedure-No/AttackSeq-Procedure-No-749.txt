### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
     - The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into memory.
     - The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The macro executed shellcode that downloaded and executed the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests.
     - Data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
     - Control servers were identified as 34.214.99.20/view_style.php, 137.74.41.56/board.php, and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant would communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding after performing initial reconnaissance and data exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests and that the data was encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - The report also mentions that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - The sequence of events in the report aligns with the sequence described in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - After collecting this information, the implant used RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server.
   - The report confirms that the implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with data encrypted with RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
