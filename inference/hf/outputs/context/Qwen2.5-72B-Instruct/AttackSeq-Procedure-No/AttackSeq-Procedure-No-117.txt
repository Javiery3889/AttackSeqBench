### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The Tuyul botnet, written in Perl, is used to execute commands on victim systems.
- Functionalities include promoting bots to higher privilege, demoting bots, updating malware, connecting to reverse shells, executing shell commands, running Perl scripts, and terminating the bot's connection.

**Persistence:**
- The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
- It also includes functionality to detect and terminate processes from other malware infections.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Tuyul malware employs a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines.
- It uses various PHP web shells to gain access to servers, including Tiny File Manager and an unknown advanced web shell.

**Command and Control:**
- The Tuyul botnet uses the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz as its C&C server, which hosts the malware files and has a valid SSL certificate.
- The attacker also maintains two development servers for script development and testing, and for logging successful infections.
- The C&C server and development servers are protected by Cloudflare.

**Others:**
- The Tuyul botnet has possible Indonesian attribution.
- The botnet's peak size was 366 victim systems.
- Infected servers are primarily hosted on cloud services such as AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode.
- The botnet's name, Tuyul, refers to a figure in Southeast Asian folklore.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems, is it likely that the Tuyul malware will periodically download a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence before executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence from the CTI Report:**
1. **Initial Access:** The report does not explicitly mention the initial access method, but it is implied that the botnet gains access to systems.
2. **Persistence:** The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
3. **Execution:** The malware can execute Perl scripts and shell commands.

**Sequence in the Question:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
2. **Persistence:** Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.
3. **Execution:** Executing Perl scripts and shell commands.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report confirms that the Tuyul malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
- The report also confirms that the malware can execute Perl scripts and shell commands.
- The initial access method (exploiting CVE-2017-9841) is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but it is a plausible method for gaining initial access to unpatched systems.

Given the information in the CTI report, the sequence described in the question is consistent with the Tuyul malware's behavior.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The Tuyul malware is known to maintain persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
- The malware can execute Perl scripts and shell commands.
- The initial access method (exploiting CVE-2017-9841) is a plausible method for gaining initial access to unpatched systems.

Therefore, the sequence described in the question is likely to occur.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
