### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which then decrypt and execute the actual Machete malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating stored credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, producing file listings, and enumerating processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C&C servers, with fallback to HTTP for exfiltration if FTP is unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete exfiltrated encrypted data to remote servers before using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes. It also mentions that the data was staged in a temporary folder where files and logs were encrypted.
   - **Command and Control:** The report indicates that Machete used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C&C servers and for exfiltration. It also mentions a fallback to HTTP if FTP was unavailable.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that Machete collected data and encrypted it before exfiltration.
   - The exfiltration methods (FTP and HTTP) are mentioned as part of the C&C communication.
   - Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the encrypted data was exfiltrated to remote servers using these methods.
