### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware (XAgent) is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware for Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- On iOS 7, the XAgent app's icon is hidden, and it runs in the background immediately.
- If the app is terminated, it restarts almost immediately.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.

**Command and Control:**
- The app collects information from the iOS device and sends it out via HTTP.
- It uses POST requests to send messages and GET requests to receive commands.
- The log messages are color-coded for easier reading by human operators.
- The full URI for C&C HTTP requests is randomly generated based on a template.
- The token used for communication is Base64 encoded with a 5-byte random prefix.
- The app can also upload files via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether the XAgent app will:
1. Collect a list of processes for discovery.
2. Send the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server.
3. Execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the information.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Step 1: Collect a list of processes for discovery**
- The report does not explicitly mention the collection of a list of processes for discovery. However, it is implied that the app collects information from the device, which could include a list of processes.

**Step 2: Send the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server**
- The report clearly states that the app sends information out via HTTP using POST requests.

**Step 3: Execute by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices only after sending the information**
- The report states that on iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- However, it does not specify that the app hides its icon and runs in the background only after sending the information.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The app collects information and sends it out via HTTP.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- The report does not indicate that the app waits to send the information before hiding its icon and running in the background.

Given this analysis, the most plausible sequence is that the app hides its icon and runs in the background immediately upon installation on iOS 7, and it sends the information out via HTTP as part of its normal operation.

**Final Answer: B: No**
