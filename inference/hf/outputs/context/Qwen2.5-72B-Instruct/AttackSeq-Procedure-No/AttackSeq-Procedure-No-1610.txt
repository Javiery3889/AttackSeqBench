     - Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses decoy documents, cloned websites, and mimics legitimate processes.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Central motive is credential harvesting, targeting Kavach.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Uses themes to target military personnel, honeytraps, and cloned websites.
   - **Collection:**
     - Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts, with geolocation verification.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during Exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
     - There is no mention of using Google Drive for exfiltration in the report.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     - The report does not provide a specific sequence indicating that data is exfiltrated over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins.
     - The focus is on the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report emphasizes the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - There is no evidence in the report suggesting that SideCopy uses Google Drive for exfiltration.
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would exfiltrate data over Google Drive before using GoLang-based file recon plugins, which is not supported by the information provided in the report.
