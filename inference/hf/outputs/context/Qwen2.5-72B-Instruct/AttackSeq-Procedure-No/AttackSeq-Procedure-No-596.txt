### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Sednit group uses email messages with malicious attachments to target specific entities.
     - These attachments are Microsoft Office documents or archives that use VBA, exploits, or DDE to download the first stage payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is achieved through email attachments with malicious documents.
     - These documents execute VBA macros to download and run the first stage payload.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Delphi downloader creates a process using `cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST` to gather system information.
     - The gathered information is sent to a C&C server, and if the target is deemed interesting, the server responds with the next stage payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Delphi downloader adds a Windows registry entry under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\` to ensure persistence.
     - The AutoIt downloader uses a similar persistence mechanism.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Delphi downloader displays a splash window with a bogus error message to distract the user.
     - The AutoIt downloader shows a splash screen related to the binary icon to mislead the victim.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The Delphi backdoor communicates with the C&C server by storing reports in temporary files and sending them encrypted.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the AutoIt downloader will repeatedly check the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system before establishing persistence through Windows registry entries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the CTI Report:**
     - The AutoIt downloader is mentioned as a first or second stage malware.
     - It performs additional reconnaissance functions and displays a splash window to mislead the victim.
     - It uses a similar persistence mechanism to the Delphi downloader, which adds a Windows registry entry.
   - **Critical Context:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the AutoIt downloader checking the mouse cursor position.
     - The primary focus of the AutoIt downloader is on displaying a splash screen and establishing persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any information about the AutoIt downloader checking the mouse cursor position.
   - The primary functions of the AutoIt downloader, as described, are to perform reconnaissance, display a splash screen, and establish persistence.
   - The report emphasizes the use of splash screens and registry entries for persistence, but not mouse cursor checks.
