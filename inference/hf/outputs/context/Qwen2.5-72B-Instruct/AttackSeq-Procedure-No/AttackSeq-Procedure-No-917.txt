### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Inject malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents, use Outlook VBA macro to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Upload harvested documents to C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after listing interesting files during discovery, Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data only before inserting malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the group injects malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.
   - **Persistence:** The report indicates that the group uses various methods for persistence, including inserting malicious macros into existing documents.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase involves listing interesting files, which includes Office documents.
   - The lateral movement phase involves injecting malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system, which implies scanning all drives, including network shared drives.
   - The persistence phase includes inserting malicious macros into existing documents to ensure they execute when reopened.

   Given this sequence, it is logical that after listing interesting files, the malware would scan all drives, including network shared drives, to find and inject malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
