### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers demonstrated significant resource development capabilities, including acquiring and parking domains.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold by being selective and careful.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report suggests the attackers had high-level system access, implying the use of privilege escalation techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like indicator removal (T1070), masquerading (T1036), subverting trust controls (T1553), and virtualization/sandbox evasion (T1497).
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used process discovery (T1057) and query registry (T1012) to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers were able to move through the network to reach their objectives.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that UNC2452 used Discovery techniques (T1057 and T1012) only after using the Application Layer Protocol for Command and Control (C2) communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Techniques (T1057 and T1012):** The report explicitly mentions that the attackers used these techniques to gain knowledge about the systems and internal network.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communications:** The report does not provide specific details on the C2 techniques used, but it is implied that the attackers had a sophisticated C2 infrastructure to maintain control over the compromised systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order in which the Discovery techniques were used relative to C2 communications. However, it is logical to assume that the attackers would need to gain initial knowledge about the systems and network (Discovery) before establishing a robust C2 channel to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The attackers gained initial access through a supply chain compromise and executed malicious code.
   - **Discovery:** To effectively move laterally and maintain persistence, the attackers would need to discover the network topology and system processes. This is a crucial step before establishing a reliable C2 channel.
   - **C2 Communications:** Once the attackers have a good understanding of the network and systems, they would set up C2 communications to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

Given this reasoning, it is unlikely that the attackers used Discovery techniques only after establishing C2 communications. Instead, they would likely use Discovery techniques early in the attack to gather the necessary information to set up and maintain C2 communications.

### Final Answer: B: No
