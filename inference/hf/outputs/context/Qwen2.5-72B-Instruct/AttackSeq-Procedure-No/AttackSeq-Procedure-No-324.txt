### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After collecting information like text messages, contact lists, and geo-location data during the Discovery phase, is it likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP as part of the Command and Control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware is designed to collect a wide range of information from the device.
- The report does not explicitly mention the Command and Control (C2) phase or any specific method of data exfiltration.

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
- **Discovery** phase involves gathering information from the system.
- **Command and Control** phase involves communication between the malware and the attacker's infrastructure.

**Reasoning:**
- The report focuses on the Discovery phase and the types of data collected.
- It does not provide explicit details about how the collected data is exfiltrated.
- However, it is common for malware to exfiltrate collected data to a remote server or C2 infrastructure.
- FTP is a possible method for data exfiltration, but it is not the only method. Other methods include HTTP, HTTPS, and custom protocols.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the malware will likely use FTP for data exfiltration.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the malware will not use FTP for data exfiltration.

Given the lack of explicit information about the C2 phase in the report, it is not definitive that FTP will be used. However, it is a plausible method for data exfiltration.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not provide specific information about the C2 phase or the method of data exfiltration.
- While FTP is a possible method, it is not explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the report.
- Therefore, it is more accurate to say that it is not likely that the malware will initiate download via FTP based on the given information.
