### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - **Collection:** APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will use Mimikatz to enable credential theft and access Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file after logging in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibiting logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report confirms that APT10 gained initial access using stolen valid user credentials through Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the working hours, but it is consistent with the behavior of APT10, which is known to operate from Tianjin, China.
   - **Credential Access:** The report clearly states that APT10 used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller.
   - **Deployment of Trochilus and NTDS.DIT Copy:** The report confirms that APT10 deployed Trochilus and copied the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access method (using stolen valid user credentials via Citrix) is consistent with the question.
   - The lateral movement behavior (consistent with Tianjin, China working hours) is a known characteristic of APT10, even though it is not explicitly stated in the report.
   - The use of Mimikatz for credential theft and accessing the Active Directory domain controller is explicitly mentioned in the report.
   - The deployment of Trochilus and copying of the NTDS.DIT database file is also explicitly mentioned in the report.
