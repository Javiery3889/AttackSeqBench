### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and relies on scheduled tasks for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses systems with high uptimes for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and moves laterally to systems with domain admin logged in.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to identify privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities to move to domain controllers and other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's C2 protocol, initially encapsulated in DNS and later in HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and larger amounts using a custom tool to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after exfiltrating staged and compressed data to cloud storage web services, the adversary is likely to perform lateral movement to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons and identify data of interest through further discovery before collecting data from information repositories like Microsoft SharePoint Online.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that the adversary exfiltrates large amounts of data using a custom tool to cloud storage services.
   - **Lateral Movement and Discovery:** The report indicates that the adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery to identify data of interest.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the sequence of actions after exfiltration. However, it is logical to assume that after exfiltrating data, the adversary might continue their operations to further compromise the network and identify additional data of interest.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The adversary's primary goal is to exfiltrate data. After exfiltrating large amounts of data, it is plausible that they would continue their operations to ensure they have not missed any valuable data.
   - The report mentions that the adversary uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and discovery, which suggests that these activities are ongoing and not limited to a single phase of the attack.
   - The adversary's use of persistent access and high-uptime systems indicates a long-term presence in the network, which supports the idea of continued lateral movement and discovery.
