### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 uses tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives, often placed in the Recycle Bin.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools like Robocopy and PSCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT10 is likely to abuse a compromised AD FS server's SAML token for lateral movement instead of leveraging shared MSP infrastructure before staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report mentions that APT10 uses stolen MSP credentials and tools like RDP for lateral movement.
     - There is no specific mention of APT10 abusing SAML tokens from a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement.
   - **Data Staging and Exfiltration:**
     - The report clearly states that APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.
     - This aligns with the question's description of staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides detailed information on APT10's methods for lateral movement, which primarily involve using stolen credentials and RDP connections.
   - The report does not mention the use of SAML tokens from a compromised AD FS server for lateral movement.
   - The report does, however, provide clear evidence that APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

APT10 is more likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement rather than abusing a compromised AD FS server's SAML token, based on the information provided in the CTI report.
