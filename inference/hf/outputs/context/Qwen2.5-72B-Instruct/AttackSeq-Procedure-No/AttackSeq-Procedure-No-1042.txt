### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
     - Initial reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
     - Second spear phish with a remote template to deliver a payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 in Office to gain initial access.
     - Use remote templates in Microsoft Word to load an external template.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploy PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
     - POWERSHOWER cleans up forensic evidence.
     - Fingerprint the machine, upload information to C&C, and potentially run a secondary payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - POWERSHOWER writes itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1.
     - Uses a run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
     - Use POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make analysis harder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - POWERSHOWER collects system information and sends it to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER is likely to use external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints to relay command traffic, as part of maintaining Command and Control after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the Report:**
     - POWERSHOWER is used to collect system information and send it to the C2 server.
     - The report mentions that POWERSHOWER uses anti-forensics techniques and is designed to make analysis harder.
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of external proxy techniques or compromising residential endpoints.
   - **Contextual Analysis:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state the use of external proxy techniques, it does highlight the attackers' focus on evading detection and maintaining persistence.
     - External proxy techniques are a common method for evading detection and maintaining a low profile, which aligns with the attackers' goals of anti-forensics and making analysis harder.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the attackers are sophisticated and use various techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence.
   - The use of external proxy techniques, such as compromising residential endpoints, is a common tactic in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns to obfuscate the true origin of command traffic and evade detection.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention this technique, the overall context and the attackers' behavior suggest that they are likely to use such advanced techniques to maintain their command and control infrastructure.
