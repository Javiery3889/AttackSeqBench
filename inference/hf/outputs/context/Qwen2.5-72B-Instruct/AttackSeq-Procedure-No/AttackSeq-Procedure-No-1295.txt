### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CozyDuke spreads via email, often containing a link to a compromised website or a ZIP file hosted on Dropbox. The ZIP file contains an executable that, upon execution, writes to disk and executes CozyDuke while presenting a decoy.
   - **Execution:** The main component of CozyDuke is a DLL file executed by the CozyDuke dropper using a copy of rundll32.exe. It handles persistence, gathers system information, communicates with the C&C server, and executes additional tasks.
   - **Persistence:** CozyDuke establishes persistence by setting itself to be executed at system startup through registry values, registering itself as a Windows service or scheduled task, or using COM-object hijacking.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper checks for anti-virus products and virtual machine/sandbox environments, and exits if these are detected. It also decrypts encrypted data stored as PE resources.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CozyDuke is likely to establish persistence through methods like registry modifications or COM-object hijacking after communicating with its C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Methods:** The CTI report explicitly states that CozyDuke establishes persistence through registry modifications, Windows services, scheduled tasks, and COM-object hijacking.
   - **C&C Communication:** The report mentions that CozyDuke communicates with the C&C server to execute additional tasks, modules, or executables as commanded. This implies that after establishing initial communication, CozyDuke can perform various actions, including maintaining persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** CozyDuke gains initial access via email and executes the main component using rundll32.exe.
   - **C&C Communication:** Once executed, CozyDuke communicates with the C&C server to receive commands.
   - **Persistence Establishment:** The report clearly states that CozyDuke establishes persistence through various methods, including registry modifications and COM-object hijacking, to ensure it remains active on the victim's system.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report, it is highly likely that CozyDuke will establish persistence through methods like registry modifications or COM-object hijacking after communicating with its C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
