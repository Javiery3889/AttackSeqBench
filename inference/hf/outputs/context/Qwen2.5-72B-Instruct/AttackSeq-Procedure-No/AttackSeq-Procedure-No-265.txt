### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, which is decrypted in memory and made executable.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant creates a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and sets up a scheduled task or registry entry for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant is likely to exfiltrate data via a custom TCP-based protocol before collecting information about the system, including using the `GetSystemTime` function for system time discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collection:** The report indicates that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It does not explicitly mention the `GetSystemTime` function, but it is reasonable to assume that system time discovery is part of the data collection process.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol after the data is collected.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that the Korplug variant first establishes persistence, then collects data, and finally exfiltrates the data.
   - The question asks if the exfiltration happens before the collection, which is not supported by the report. The report clearly indicates that data collection happens before exfiltration.
