### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
   - **Execution:** The threat actors uploaded a variety of tools to the compromised servers, including legitimate applications and post-exploitation tools like Mimikatz. They also uploaded custom backdoors such as HyperBro.
   - **Persistence:** The actors installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Emissary Panda used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and used the China Chopper webshell to maintain access and evade defenses.
   - **Credential Access:** The actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Command and Control:** The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, to perform execution only after exploiting the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to gain initial access by installing webshells on SharePoint servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report clearly states that Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting the SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) and installed webshells.
   - **Execution:** After gaining initial access, the report mentions that the threat actors uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors, including HyperBro.
   - **Sequence:** The sequence of events in the report aligns with the question. The initial access was followed by the upload of tools and backdoors, which were then used for further activities like persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, and command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access (CVE-2019-0604):** Emissary Panda exploited the SharePoint vulnerability to gain initial access and install webshells.
   - **Upload of Tools and Backdoors:** After gaining initial access, they uploaded tools and custom backdoors, including HyperBro.
   - **Subsequent Activities:** The uploaded tools and backdoors were used for various activities, including persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, and command and control.
