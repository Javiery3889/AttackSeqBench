### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
     - Archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
     - Some variants also injected themselves into processes such as 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - C&C servers operated within limited daily windows.
     - Fileless loading techniques and frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:**
     - Aria-body backdoor capabilities include file management, screenshots, process enumeration, OS information gathering, and more.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication.
     - Sent collected data to C&C domain with an XORed password.
     - Listened for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor, after gathering information about the victim's machine, is likely to achieve persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key followed by injecting itself into 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report explicitly states that the Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
     - Some variants also injected themselves into processes such as 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The Aria-body backdoor gathers information about the victim's machine, which aligns with the 'Collection' phase.
     - After gathering information, the backdoor is likely to establish persistence and inject itself into processes to maintain control and evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to gather information about the victim's machine.
   - Once the information is gathered, the backdoor is likely to establish persistence to ensure it remains on the system.
   - The report mentions that the Aria-body loader achieves persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - Additionally, some variants inject themselves into processes like 'rundll32.exe' or 'dllhost.exe' to maintain persistence and evade detection.
