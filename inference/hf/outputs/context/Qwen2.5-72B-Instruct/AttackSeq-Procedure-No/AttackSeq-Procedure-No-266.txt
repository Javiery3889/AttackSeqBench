### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign targets research entities, ISPs, and European diplomatic missions, using current events to lure victims.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used, with filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant creates a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and sets up a scheduled task or registry entry for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Korplug variant is likely to remotely discover systems over LAN connections before exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. This implies that the malware has the capability to discover and collect data from network shared drives, which can be considered a form of remote discovery over LAN connections.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report aligns with the question. After establishing persistence, the malware collects data from various sources, including network shared drives, which involves remote discovery over LAN connections.
   - The exfiltration of data is then performed using the same custom TCP-based protocol used for C&C communication.
