### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering, often through fake accounts and identities, to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** They use various malware, including a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) that logs keystrokes and connects to victims' Gmail accounts.
   - **Persistence:** They repeatedly target the same victims with new cover stories and techniques.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use fake identities, breach websites, and employ anti-debugging and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** Infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download malware and monitor communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Rocket Kitten will employ a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts under Credential Access after establishing communication with a C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Usage:** The report explicitly mentions that Rocket Kitten uses a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts.
   - **C&C Communication:** The report states that the infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download malware and monitor communications.
   - **Credential Access:** The keylogger's function of logging keystrokes and connecting to victims' Gmail accounts aligns with the goal of gaining access to additional accounts, which is a form of Credential Access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** Rocket Kitten gains initial access through spear phishing and then uses a keylogger to log keystrokes.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** They maintain persistence and evade detection through various techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** After establishing communication with the C&C server, they can download additional malware and monitor communications.
   - **Credential Access:** The keylogger, which is already in use, captures keystrokes and connects to victims' Gmail accounts, effectively gaining access to additional accounts.
