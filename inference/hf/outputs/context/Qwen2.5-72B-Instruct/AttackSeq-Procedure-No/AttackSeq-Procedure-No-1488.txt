### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack uses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2013 (CVE-2014-4114) to deliver BlackEnergy 3 malware via infected Excel documents.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed through a Visual Basic macro, which reassembles and runs a PE32 executable (vba_macro.exe). This executable drops two additional files, FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, and then deletes itself.
   - **Persistence:** The malware registers a binary to the startup shell to ensure FONTCACHE.DAT is executed upon system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various anti-debugging techniques, including CryptDecrypt() function calls, SetUnhandledExceptionFilter API, kernel debugger checks, and IsDebuggerPresent API.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function API.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The malware is designed to move laterally and sends data to servers in major ISPs across Europe.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with its C2 server using HTTP, sending localization data and keyboard layout information to the IP address 5.149.254.114.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BlackEnergy 3 malware will automatically exfiltrate stolen files to Dropbox after communicating with its C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report provides detailed information about the malware's behavior, including its communication with the C2 server. However, it does not mention any specific exfiltration to Dropbox.
   - The report focuses on the malware's communication with the C2 server using HTTP and the data it sends (localization data and keyboard layout information).
   - There is no indication in the report that the malware uses Dropbox or any other cloud storage service for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report is comprehensive and covers various aspects of the malware's behavior, including its initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, and C2 communication.
   - The report does not mention any exfiltration to Dropbox or any other cloud storage service.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report, it is reasonable to assume that if the malware used Dropbox for exfiltration, it would have been mentioned.
