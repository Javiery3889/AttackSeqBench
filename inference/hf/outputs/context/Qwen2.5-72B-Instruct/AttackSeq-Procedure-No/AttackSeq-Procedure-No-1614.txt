### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The attack targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions.
- Linked to a campaign targeting Brazilian banking institutions.
- Final phase executable contains Portuguese comments, suggesting a link with Banload malware.

**Initial Access:**
- Begins with a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT).
- The email includes a link to download a malicious attachment, COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip.
- The zip file contains a malicious .bat file and a legitimate file (GoogleUpdate.exe).

**Execution:**
- The .bat file executes a PowerShell script to download and run a malicious file (md.zip) containing the main malware library DLL and other services.
- The script creates a random variable, a folder in %Public%, extracts files, renames them, and creates a file with specific contents.

**Persistence:**
- The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings for startup persistence, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The main malicious file (12.dll) is protected with VMProtect packer to make static analysis difficult.
- The malware uses VMProtect to make analysis harder.

**Credential Access:**
- The malware aims to steal bank credentials by displaying a data update request.
- It accesses Outlook info to collect email accounts from the contacts list for BEC attacks.

**Collection:**
- The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect contacts' email accounts.
- The collected data is sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

**Command and Control:**
- The PowerShell script communicates with the domains h1m2en.ddns.net and dgi1b2n3m4.ddns.net to download malware and send collected data.

**Others:**
- SCILabs created a YARA rule to identify files related to the Cosmic Banker campaign.
- Additional malware was found, including 14 additional compressed files named md.zip and a file named Java_qeyghf8_V.zip containing pp.png.
- The malware detection rate fluctuates from 9 to 27 antivirus search engines.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After accessing Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect email accounts from contacts, will the collected email accounts be automatically exfiltrated over FTP to remote servers?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect contacts' email accounts.
- The collected data is sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that the collected data is sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
- There is no mention of the data being exfiltrated over FTP.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly states that the collected email accounts are sent to the cyber actors through a POST web request.
2. There is no mention of FTP being used for exfiltration.
3. The question asks if the data is automatically exfiltrated over FTP, which is not supported by the information in the report.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
