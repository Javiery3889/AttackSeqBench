### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Exploiting public-facing applications (e.g., FortiOS CVE-2018-13379, 1-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection).
- Uploading webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Deploying custom malware, including a .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper'.
- 'IPsec Helper' is registered as a service for persistence and can execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

**Persistence:**
- Deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Using obfuscated webshells (e.g., variations of ASPXSpy).
- 'IPsec Helper' can update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Using webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts.
- Utilizing publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Awaits commands from C2 servers, which include updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether Agrius is likely to deploy CaddyWiper on victim systems to wipe files related to OT capabilities along with mapped drives and physical drive partitions as part of its data destruction activities.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Agrius uses a variety of techniques for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is capable of executing commands, uploading files, and updating its configuration based on C2 commands.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of CaddyWiper or any data destruction activities.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This would imply that Agrius has a known capability or intent to deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction.
  - The CTI report does not provide any evidence of Agrius using CaddyWiper or engaging in data destruction activities.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This aligns with the information provided in the CTI report, which does not mention CaddyWiper or data destruction activities.
  - The report focuses on the group's activities related to initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not mention any data destruction activities or the use of CaddyWiper.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is described as capable of executing various commands, but the report does not specify that these commands include deploying CaddyWiper.
- Given the information provided, it is more plausible that Agrius does not deploy CaddyWiper for data destruction activities.

**Final Answer: B: No**
