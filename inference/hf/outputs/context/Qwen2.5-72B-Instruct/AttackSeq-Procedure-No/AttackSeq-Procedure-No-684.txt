### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries use worms and scanning tools like masscan to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts.
     - They use public search engines like Shodan or Censys to find misconfigurations.
     - The function DOCKERGEDDON is used to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Infrastructure analysis reveals IPs used for Kinsing malware.
     - Domains like teamtnt[.]red, kaiserfranz[.]cc, and borg[.]wtf are used for CnC, DNS, and IRC.
     - Compromised websites store malicious files.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports.
     - Use of typo-squatting to trick developers into pulling malicious container images.
     - Attacks on GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI to execute crypto miners.
   - **Execution:**
     - Use of command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands.
     - Downloading and executing scripts or binaries from remote sources.
     - Scheduling local jobs using cron.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Use of LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Creation of new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Use of hostPath mount to gain persistence on the host.
     - Use of chroot to run processes outside the container.
     - Use of external remote services like IRC channels.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removal of security software.
     - Use of obfuscated files and fileless malware.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Use of open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Creation and hiding of user accounts.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Use of proxy tools like Ngrok.
     - Use of legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
     - Data encoding to establish contact with C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if attackers will delete shadow volumes using `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` before achieving their ultimate objective of resource hijacking through malicious container images.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that attackers use worms and scanning tools to find misconfigured hosts and exploit exposed Docker API ports.
   - **Resource Hijacking:**
     - The report mentions that attackers use malicious container images to execute crypto miners and other malicious activities.
   - **Shadow Volume Deletion:**
     - The report does not mention the use of `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` or any similar command to delete shadow volumes.
   - **Context:**
     - The report focuses on Docker and container-related attacks, which are primarily Linux-based environments. The `vssadmin.exe` command is specific to Windows and is used to manage shadow copies, which are not typically relevant in a Docker container context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not indicate any use of `vssadmin.exe` or any similar command to delete shadow volumes.
   - The focus of the attack is on Docker and container environments, which are primarily Linux-based.
   - The ultimate objective of the attackers is resource hijacking through malicious container images, which is consistent with the report.
   - There is no mention of any Windows-specific activities or commands in the report.

### Final Answer: B: No
