### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The Tuyul botnet, written in Perl, executes commands on victim systems.
- Functionalities include promoting bots to higher privilege, demoting bots, updating malware, connecting to reverse shells, executing shell commands, running Perl scripts, and terminating the bot's connection.

**Persistence:**
- The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
- It also includes functionality to detect and terminate processes from other malware infections.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Tuyul malware uses a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines.
- It employs various PHP web shells to gain access to servers, including Tiny File Manager and an unknown advanced web shell.

**Command and Control:**
- The Tuyul botnet uses the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz as its C&C server, which hosts the malware files and has a valid SSL certificate.
- The attacker maintains two development servers for script development and testing, and for logging successful infections.
- The C&C server and development servers are protected by Cloudflare.

**Others:**
- The Tuyul botnet has possible Indonesian attribution.
- The botnet's peak size was 366 victim systems.
- Infected servers are primarily hosted on cloud services such as AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode.
- The botnet's name, Tuyul, refers to a figure in Southeast Asian folklore.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems, is it likely that the Tuyul malware will leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report mentions that the Tuyul botnet exploits CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.

**Leveraging Legitimate Credentials:**
- The report does not mention the Tuyul malware leveraging legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. The focus is on the malware's execution, persistence, and command and control mechanisms.

**Persistence:**
- The report clearly states that the Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.

**Conclusion:**
- The report does not provide any evidence that the Tuyul malware leverages legitimate credentials to log into external remote services. The primary methods of persistence and command and control are through downloading scripts and using a C&C server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The Tuyul botnet gains initial access through CVE-2017-9841.
- The report does not mention the use of legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.
- The malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

Given the information in the CTI report, it is not likely that the Tuyul malware will leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services before maintaining persistence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
