### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. It used a multi-stage execution process involving shellcode and a temporary file.
   - **Execution:** The malware used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, which performed security checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data about the system, stole files from removable media, and captured Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C2 server was done using a binary protocol over a specified port.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated by compressing, encrypting, and sending it to the C2 server. The malware also logged file and directory operations, clipboard data, and network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to use the BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) protocol to exfiltrate stolen data after achieving persistence and before creating mutexes and named events to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that T9000 exfiltrated data by compressing, encrypting, and sending it to the C2 server. It does not mention the use of the BITS protocol.
   - **Avoiding Detection:** The report does not explicitly mention the creation of mutexes and named events to avoid detection. However, it does mention extensive evasion techniques, which could include such methods.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that T9000 uses the BITS protocol for exfiltration. Instead, it specifies that the malware uses a binary protocol over a specified port.
   - The report does not explicitly state the use of mutexes and named events, but it does mention extensive evasion techniques, which could include such methods.
   - Given the detailed information provided about the exfiltration method (binary protocol over a specified port), it is unlikely that T9000 would use the BITS protocol for exfiltration.
