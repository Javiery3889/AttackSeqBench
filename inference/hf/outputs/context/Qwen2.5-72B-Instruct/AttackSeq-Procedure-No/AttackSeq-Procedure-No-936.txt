### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks and has advanced knowledge of their victims' whereabouts.
   - **Resource Development:** They have the ability to compromise trusted commercial network resources and possess advanced mathematical and crypto-analytical capabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates and by seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign their backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They use keyloggers and information stealers to collect and encrypt data.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Darkhotel APT is likely to use Visual Basic or create VBScripts to execute malicious code after seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware for initial access, and before maintaining persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that Darkhotel APT seeds Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware, which is downloaded thousands of times.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that they maintain persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.
   - **Execution Method:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of Visual Basic or VBScripts. However, it is common for malware to use VBScripts for execution, especially in the context of autorun registry settings, as VBScripts can be used to run malicious code at system boot.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of the Darkhotel APT and their use of advanced techniques, it is plausible that they would use VBScripts to execute their malicious code. VBScripts are a common method for automating tasks and can be used to run malware at system boot.
   - The use of autorun registry settings for persistence is consistent with the use of VBScripts, as VBScripts can be set to run automatically when the system starts.
