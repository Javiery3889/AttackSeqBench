### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The exploit leverages a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- It uses a Flash SWF file to prepare the heap.
- The IE bug is triggered via JavaScript.
- Corrupted Flash vector objects are used for memory access.
- Runtime ROP generation is used to search for specific APIs and construct a ROP chain.
- The ROP chain is used to execute shellcode that:
  - Makes memory executable.
  - Clears debug registers (likely to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation).
  - Downloads the next stage of the payload.

**Others:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2014-1776.
- It affects IE6 through IE11, but targets IE9 through IE11.
- The threat actors are using this exploit in 'Operation Clandestine Fox.'
- Mitigation measures include using EMET and Enhanced Protected Mode in IE.
- The attack requires Adobe Flash to function.
- The APT group has a history of using browser-based 0-day exploits and is proficient at lateral movement.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access and executing shellcode to make memory executable during the exploitation phase, is it likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass EAF mitigation before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections as part of defense evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. Prepare the heap with a Flash SWF file.
2. Trigger the IE bug via JavaScript.
3. Use corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
4. Generate a ROP chain to search for specific APIs.
5. Execute shellcode to:
   - Make memory executable.
   - Clear debug registers (bypass EAF).
   - Download the next stage of the payload.

**Key Points:**
- The shellcode makes memory executable and clears debug registers.
- Clearing debug registers is likely to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation.
- The ROP chain is used to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

**Evaluation:**
- The sequence indicates that the shellcode first makes memory executable and clears debug registers.
- Clearing debug registers is a step to bypass EAF.
- After this, the ROP chain is used to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

**Conclusion:**
- The exploit does indeed bypass EAF mitigation (by clearing debug registers) before attempting to bypass ASLR and DEP protections.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes
