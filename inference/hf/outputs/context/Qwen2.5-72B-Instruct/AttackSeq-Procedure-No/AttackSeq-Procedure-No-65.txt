### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events.
   - **Persistence:** Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and file system path changes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, such as API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and virtual environment detection.
   - **Credential Access:** It steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** It communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds. The first command received is a list of all currently connected victims, including collected information about their machines.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro is likely to communicate with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK to receive commands before discovering system information such as the operating system version.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** The report mentions that Grandoreiro communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds. The first command received is a list of all currently connected victims, including collected information about their machines.
   - **System Information Discovery:** The report does not explicitly state when the malware discovers system information such as the operating system version. However, it is implied that the malware collects information about the machine, which is likely part of the initial communication with the C&C server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after ensuring persistence, Grandoreiro would likely communicate with the C&C server to receive commands and collect information about the machine.
   - The first command received from the C&C server includes collected information about the machine, which implies that the malware must have already gathered this information before or during the initial communication with the C&C server.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Grandoreiro would communicate with the C&C server to receive commands before or while discovering system information such as the operating system version.
