### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** UNC1945 exploited vulnerabilities in Solaris servers to install backdoors like SLAPSTICK and EVILSUN.
   - **Execution:** Custom virtual machines and backdoors (LEMONSTICK) were used for command execution and file transfer.
   - **Persistence:** SLAPSTICK backdoor and placement of legitimate files to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used SLAPSTICK and Mimikatz to escalate privileges and install additional backdoors.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-forensics techniques and in-memory execution of obfuscation tools.
   - **Credential Access:** Collected credentials using SLAPSTICK and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** Used custom virtual machines and reconnaissance tools for internal scanning and network exploitation.
   - **Command and Control:** SSH Port Forwarding and custom QEMU Virtual Machines for maintaining access.
   - **Others:** No evidence of data exfiltration, and ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment was observed but not attributed to UNC1945.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if UNC1945 will abuse OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts before moving laterally to a Windows server via RDP in the Lateral Movement phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that UNC1945 used various tools for internal reconnaissance, including network scanners and reconnaissance tools within their custom virtual machines. This aligns with the question's mention of using reconnaissance tools.
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that UNC1945 collected credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz. However, there is no mention of OAuth access tokens or email accounts.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention RDP for lateral movement. Instead, it focuses on the use of backdoors and Mimikatz for credential access and lateral movement.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any evidence that UNC1945 used OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts.
   - The report focuses on the use of backdoors and Mimikatz for credential access and lateral movement, rather than RDP for lateral movement to a Windows server.
   - Given the information provided, it is more plausible that UNC1945 used the backdoors and Mimikatz for lateral movement rather than OAuth access tokens and RDP.

### Final Answer
