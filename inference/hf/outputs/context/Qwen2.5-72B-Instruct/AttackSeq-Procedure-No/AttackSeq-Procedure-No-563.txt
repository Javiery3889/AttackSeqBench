### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report suggests that the attackers had extensive knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems and network topology.
   - **Resource Development:** The attackers acquired and parked domains for future use and had access to private web servers.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise (T1195.002) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute code.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers maintained their foothold carefully.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report does not provide specific details, but the attackers had high-level system access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used valid accounts (T1078).
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network.
   - **Collection:** The attackers focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used T1071 and T1568 for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on data theft.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage, not destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the threat actors likely used T1057 Process Discovery after leveraging T1071 Application Layer Protocol for command and control and T1553 Subvert Trust Controls for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **T1553 Subvert Trust Controls:** The report mentions that the attackers used this technique to evade defenses.
   - **T1071 Application Layer Protocol:** The report confirms that the attackers used this technique for command and control.
   - **T1057 Process Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention this technique, but it is a logical step for attackers to gather information about the systems and network after gaining command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question is:
     1. T1553 Subvert Trust Controls (Defense Evasion)
     2. T1071 Application Layer Protocol (Command and Control)
     3. T1057 Process Discovery (Collection)
   - The report confirms the use of T1553 and T1071.
   - T1057 Process Discovery is a common technique used by attackers to understand the environment they are operating in, which is crucial for further actions like lateral movement and data collection.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the attack and the focus on information theft, it is highly likely that the attackers would use T1057 to gather detailed information about the systems and network.
