### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Date:** July 8, 2015
- **Method:** Spear-phishing attack
- **Vulnerability Exploited:** Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119)
- **Domains Involved:** rpt.perrydale[.]com, report.perrydale[.]com
- **IP Address:** 194.44.130.179
- **Exploit File:** show.swf
- **Secondary Payload:** b.gif

**Execution:**
- **Exploit File:** show.swf
- **ActionScript Classes:** MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, ShellWin32.as
- **Exploit Mechanism:** Use-after-free condition (CVE-2015-5119)
- **Shared Functions:** Data type manipulation, logging, decrypting shellcode
- **Similarity to Previous Attacks:** Shared techniques with CVE-2015-3113 attacks
- **Payload Extraction:** From an animated GIF image (b.gif)

**Others:**
- **Attribution:** Likely attributed to the APT group known as UPS or APT3
- **Techniques:** Payload extraction and decryption from GIF images, similar shellcode for CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-3113

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- **Context:** After the spear-phishing attack leveraging a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119
- **Query:** Is it likely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will downgrade NTLM to capture NTLM hashes before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack uses a Flash exploit (show.swf) to gain initial access.
- The exploit leverages a use-after-free condition (CVE-2015-5119).
- The shellcode is designed to install a payload from a GIF image (b.gif).
- The report does not mention any techniques related to downgrading NTLM or capturing NTLM hashes.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This would imply that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ includes functionality to downgrade NTLM and capture NTLM hashes.
  - The CTI report does not provide any evidence of such behavior. The focus is on the use-after-free exploit and the installation of the payload from the GIF image.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This aligns with the information provided in the CTI report. The report does not mention any NTLM downgrading or hash capturing techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report focuses on the initial access and execution phases of the attack.
- The report details the use of a Flash exploit (show.swf) to gain initial access and the subsequent installation of a payload from a GIF image (b.gif).
- There is no mention of NTLM downgrading or hash capturing in the report.
- Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ includes functionality to downgrade NTLM and capture NTLM hashes.

**Final Answer: B: No**
