### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
- Malicious Flash objects in PDF files exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Executable files are disguised as images or documents.

**Execution:**
- Uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- Loader compilation dates and updates are noted.

**Persistence:**
- Creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service'.
- Installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup' with the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service'.
- Copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.

**Credential Access:**
- Steals credentials from various software and Windows.
- Exports certificates and private keys using the password 'saribas'.

**Discovery:**
- Searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
- Targets specific file patterns and non-English filenames.

**Command and Control:**
- Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
- Uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updates.
- Configuration is embedded and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

**Exfiltration:**
- Collected data is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.
- Details of login credentials and FTP folder structure are provided.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After searching removable drives and skipping certain file types during collection, is CosmicDuke likely to compress output data generated by command execution with a custom implementation of the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- CosmicDuke uses FTP for exfiltration.
- The configuration is compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1, not LZW.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that CosmicDuke uses FTP for exfiltration, which aligns with the question.
- However, the report specifically states that the configuration is compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1, not LZW.
- There is no mention of a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm being used for compressing output data before exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the configuration is compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.
- There is no indication that CosmicDuke uses a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for compressing output data.
- Therefore, the correct answer is that CosmicDuke is not likely to use a custom implementation of the LZW algorithm for this purpose.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
