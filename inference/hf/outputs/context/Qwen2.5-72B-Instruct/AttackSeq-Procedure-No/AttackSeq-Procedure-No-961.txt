### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities and unknown PE files were used for reconnaissance.
     - The backdoor named CommsCacher and its configuration file encrypted with the VEST algorithm were used to monitor RDP sessions.
     - The attackers attempted to connect to the domain forecareer[.]com, which mimicked the official website of General Dynamics Mission Systems.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
     - These documents activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and the backdoor CommsCacher.
     - The Windows command line and the SQLite DLL library were used for execution.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using sc.exe and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders and removed from the file system.
     - rundll32.exe was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Information about users, network settings, and processes was collected using system utilities and SMBMap.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally.
     - Their own data encryption algorithm was used to communicate with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains using the HTTP protocol only before moving laterally.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The report mentions that the attackers used their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with C2 servers.
     - The use of a custom encryption algorithm suggests that the communication is not limited to HTTP only.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.
     - The communication with C2 servers and lateral movement are described as separate but related activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the Lazarus Group used a custom encryption algorithm for communication with C2 servers, which implies that the communication is not limited to HTTP.
   - The lateral movement was achieved using compromised privileged accounts, and the communication with C2 servers was part of the overall attack strategy but not necessarily restricted to HTTP.
   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the malware would communicate with C2 servers using HTTP only before moving laterally.
