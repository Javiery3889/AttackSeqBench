### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with social engineering tactics, where victims were lured into opening email attachments or downloading reports on political affairs.
   - **Execution:** Upon opening the malicious documents, the Pierogi backdoor was installed. The documents contained decoy content to lower suspicions.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor checked for antivirus and security products and used techniques like file deletion and software packing to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor collected information about the infected machine.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor took screenshots and executed arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information, receiving commands, and uploading data such as screenshots.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after exfiltrating data by using web services for uploading screenshots to the C2 server, it is likely that the Pierogi backdoor will communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs to send machine information and receive commands.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration of Data:** The report mentions that the backdoor can upload data such as screenshots to the C2 server.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:** The report explicitly states that the backdoor communicates with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The backdoor's capabilities include both exfiltrating data and communicating with C2 servers for further commands and information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data (e.g., screenshots) to the C2 server.
   - After exfiltrating data, it is logical for the backdoor to communicate with the C2 server to send additional machine information and receive further commands.
   - The report clearly states that the backdoor uses predefined URLs for these communications.
