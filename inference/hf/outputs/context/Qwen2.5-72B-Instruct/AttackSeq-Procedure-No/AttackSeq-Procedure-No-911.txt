### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macros to spread.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Gamaredon is likely to automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server before scanning all drives for sensitive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also states that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The group injects malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system, which implies scanning all drives for documents to infect.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the group's backdoors list interesting files for future exfiltration and that the modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report suggests that the listing of interesting files is a precursor to exfiltration.
   - The report does not explicitly state that the group scans all drives for sensitive data before exfiltration, but it does imply that the group is thorough in its data collection and exfiltration processes.

Given the information, it is reasonable to infer that the group would upload the harvested documents to the C&C server as part of their exfiltration process, and this would likely occur before or concurrently with scanning all drives for additional sensitive data.

### Final Answer
