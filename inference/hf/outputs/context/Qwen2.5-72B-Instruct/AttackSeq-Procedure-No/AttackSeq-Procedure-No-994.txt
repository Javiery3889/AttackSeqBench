### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** PROMETHIUM uses trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The malware is deployed using trojanized installers and uses a service for persistence. It also reconfigures Windows Defender to add exclusions.
   - **Persistence:** A service is created to launch the C2 contact module upon service startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware checks for specific antiviruses and adds its directories to Windows Defender exclusions.
   - **Collection:** The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files, compresses them into an archive, and encodes the archive.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 infrastructure includes around 30 new C2 domains, and communication is over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will exfiltrate data to the C2 server every 10 minutes during the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not provide specific details about the frequency of data exfiltration. However, it does mention that the malware compresses and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server.
   - Typically, malware that exfiltrates data every 10 minutes would need to have a very specific and frequent communication schedule, which is not mentioned in the report.
   - The report suggests that the C2 communication is over HTTPS and uses self-signed certificates, but it does not indicate a high-frequency exfiltration pattern.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report focuses on the initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, and collection phases in detail.
   - The exfiltration phase is mentioned, but the frequency of exfiltration is not specified.
   - Given the lack of specific information about frequent exfiltration and the typical behavior of malware, it is more likely that the exfiltration occurs at a less frequent interval, possibly triggered by specific events or conditions rather than a fixed 10-minute interval.
