### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Adversaries gather publicly available information and use active discovery methods to target potential victims.

**Initial Access:**
- Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.
- They deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) via weaponized MS Office email attachments.
- Employees open the attachments and enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3.

**Execution:**
- Once macros are enabled, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on the workstation.
- These files begin communication with external Command and Control (C2) servers.

**Credential Access:**
- BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
- Adversaries gather stored credentials and log keystrokes.
- They use stolen administrator credentials to access domain controllers and create new privileged accounts.

**Discovery:**
- Adversaries conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand access.
- They use valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins to enumerate systems and identify targets.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting before establishing a connection to an attacker-controlled C2 server.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access and Execution:**
  - The report states that after employees enable macros, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on the workstation.
  - These files begin communication with external C2 servers.

- **Credential Access and Discovery:**
  - The report also states that BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions.
  - This suggests that the malware is capable of performing these actions once it is installed and has established a connection to the C2 server.

- **Sequence of Events:**
  - The report does not explicitly state the order in which these actions occur.
  - However, it is logical to assume that the malware would first establish a connection to the C2 server to receive further instructions and then proceed with internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reasoning:**
  - The malware needs to establish a connection to the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
  - Once the connection is established, the malware can then perform internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
  - The report does not contradict this sequence and provides a logical flow of events.

- **Final Answer:**
  - **B: No**

The malware is likely to establish a connection to the C2 server before enabling internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting.
