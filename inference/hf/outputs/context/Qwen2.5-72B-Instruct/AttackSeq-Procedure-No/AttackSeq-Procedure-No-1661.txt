### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware infects removable media and collects data from drives when reconnected to the system.
   - **Execution:** netsat.exe operates as a master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data from infected drives. It receives commands from an encrypted file on the local system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware includes features to clean up after itself by deleting key indicators of its presence and employs date sensitivity, deleting itself after a hardcoded date to avoid detection.
   - **Collection:** The malware collects data in the form of files, which may be obfuscated via a custom XOR operation.
   - **Command and Control:** Command and control (C2) is accomplished via commands in an encrypted file stored on the local 'master' system.
   - **Exfiltration:** The means of exfiltration are not determined, but the data collection functionality of netsat.exe suggests that data for exfiltration might be collected by the 'master' system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether netsat.exe will infect connected removable media and collect data from infected drives only after the malware self-deletes based on a hardcoded date for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     1. **Initial Access:** The malware infects removable media.
     2. **Execution:** netsat.exe operates as the master program, infecting connected removable media and collecting data.
     3. **Defense Evasion:** The malware self-deletes after a hardcoded date.
     4. **Collection:** Data is collected from infected drives.
   - **Critical Points:**
     - The malware self-deletes after a hardcoded date to avoid detection.
     - The infection and data collection from connected removable media are ongoing processes until the malware self-deletes.
   - **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes** - This would imply that the infection and data collection from connected removable media only occur after the malware self-deletes, which contradicts the report.
     - **B: No** - This aligns with the report, as the infection and data collection occur before the malware self-deletes.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
