### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities using spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Initial Access:** They use spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and exploits (CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-6352) and watering hole attacks with malicious PowerPoint documents.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** The file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals and uses resilient communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victimâ€™s machine after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. This aligns with the question's context.
   - **Collection:** The report specifies that the file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server. However, it does not mention the collection of browser cookies.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed list of file types that the file-stealer module collects, and browser cookies (such as those from Google Chrome and Apple Safari) are not included in this list.
   - While the backdoor is capable of downloading additional malware, the specific task of stealing browser cookies is not mentioned in the report.
   - The focus of the file-stealer module appears to be on document and presentation files, which are more relevant to the high-profile diplomatic and economic targets.
