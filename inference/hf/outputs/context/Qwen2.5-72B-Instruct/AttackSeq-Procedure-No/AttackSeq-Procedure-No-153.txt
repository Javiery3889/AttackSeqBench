### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 uses tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to stage data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts after using dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure with tools like Robocopy and PSCP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains:** The report mentions that APT10 has significantly increased the number of dynamic-DNS domains used for operations.
   - **Tools for Data Staging and Exfiltration:** The report explicitly states that APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.
   - **Robocopy and PSCP:** While the report does not specifically mention Robocopy and PSCP, it does mention the use of remote command execution scripts, which aligns with the use of these tools.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools launched via remote command execution scripts.
   - The use of dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure is also mentioned, and it is consistent with the actor's sophisticated and evolving tactics.
   - The tools Robocopy and PSCP are not explicitly mentioned, but the use of remote command execution scripts is, which suggests that APT10 is capable of using such tools for data staging and exfiltration.
