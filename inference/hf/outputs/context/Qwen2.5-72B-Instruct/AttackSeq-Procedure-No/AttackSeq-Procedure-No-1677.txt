### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers used mules to open bank accounts and request debit/ATM cards.
     - They gained initial entry through opportunistic phishing emails to employees, leading to the creation of backdoors on compromised systems.
     - Social engineering techniques were also used to obtain backdoor access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers leveraged control weaknesses in the Windows network to launch lateral movement attacks and obtain 'Keys to the Kingdom'.
     - They compromised the Enterprise Admin account on the processor's network.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers used legitimate Windows and PowerShell commands, PSExec, and plink.exe for lateral movement.
     - They used commercial monitoring applications and 'Cobalt Strike Beacon' to maintain backdoor connections.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The attackers identified and used bank employee accounts with authorization to request and approve changes to customer debit cards.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The attackers compromised the third-party processor's network using captured credentials.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The attackers coordinated ATM withdrawals using command and control with physical mules.
   - **Impact:**
     - The attackers manipulated the bank's internal systems to enable high overdraft levels and removed anti-fraud controls.
     - They performed cash withdrawals from various ATMs, removing up to USD$10 million from each bank.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers gained initial access through opportunistic phishing emails and created backdoors on compromised systems only after executing malicious payloads, including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers gained initial access through opportunistic phishing emails to employees, leading to the creation of backdoors on compromised systems.
   - **Malicious Payloads and 'Mipko' Employee Monitor:**
     - The report mentions the use of commercial monitoring applications and 'Cobalt Strike Beacon' for maintaining backdoor connections, but it does not specifically mention the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The report indicates that the initial access was gained through phishing emails, and backdoors were created. The use of monitoring tools and other malicious payloads is mentioned but not in a specific sequence relative to the initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide a clear sequence indicating that the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool occurred only after gaining initial access and creating backdoors.
   - The use of monitoring tools and other malicious payloads is mentioned in the context of maintaining backdoor connections and defense evasion, but not in a specific order relative to the initial access.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers created backdoors on compromised systems only after executing malicious payloads including the installation of the 'Mipko' Employee Monitor tool, as the report does not support this specific sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
