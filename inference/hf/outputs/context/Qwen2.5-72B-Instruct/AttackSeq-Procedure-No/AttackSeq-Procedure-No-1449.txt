#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After sending emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT in order to gain initial access, is it likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The adversary uses compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
- The adversary uses VPSs to host malware C2s.

**Sequence of TTPs:**
1. **Initial Access**: Sending emails with a diplomatic-themed PDF attachment containing a link to ENVYSCOUT.
2. **Resource Development**: Developing VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s.
3. **Resource Development**: Using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the adversary uses compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the information provided in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the adversary uses compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts and VPSs to host malware C2s.
- The question asks if it is likely that the adversary will develop VPS infrastructure to host malware C2s by using compromised webservers to host ENVYSCOUT delivery scripts.
- The information in the CTI report supports this sequence of actions.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
