### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or move laterally.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing security mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for further access.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to find relevant systems and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** Removing the data from the network.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that tools will be moved laterally by transferring files to a network share as part of employing internal spearphishing techniques after persistence is established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that persistence ensures ongoing access to the network. This is a critical step for long-term operations.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention lateral movement, but it is implied in the context of spreading across the target network and gaining access to strategic goals.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves tricking internal users to execute malicious actions, often by sending emails with malicious attachments or links. Transferring files to a network share can be a part of this process, especially if the attacker is trying to spread malware or tools within the network.
   - **File Transfer:** Transferring files to a network share is a common method for lateral movement and can be used to distribute tools or malware.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After establishing persistence, the attacker has ongoing access to the network and can use various techniques to move laterally.
   - Internal spearphishing is a method that can be used to spread malware or tools within the network.
   - Transferring files to a network share is a plausible method for distributing tools or malware, especially in a scenario where the attacker has already established persistence and is looking to move laterally.
