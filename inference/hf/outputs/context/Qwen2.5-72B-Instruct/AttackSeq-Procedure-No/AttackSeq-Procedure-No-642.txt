### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Visitors to compromised websites were exposed to exploits after their browsers were fingerprinted.
- Threat actors engaged in spearphishing campaigns, sending emails with malicious Word documents containing VBA macros.

**Execution:**
- The malicious Word documents contained VBA macros that executed code using the Document_Open function.

**Command and Control:**
- The scripts from the watering hole attacks communicated with the C&C servers using HTTPS.

**Others:**
- The campaign targeted high-profile organizations in the Middle East, with a focus on Yemen.
- The attackers likely purchased Candiru implants and exploits.
- The campaign involved strategic web compromises, where the attackers modified legitimate websites to inject malicious scripts.
- The campaign went quiet after July 2021, possibly due to the threat actors retooling after publications by Citizen Lab, Google, and Microsoft detailed Candiru's activities.
- A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples is available on GitHub.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After renting servers from hosting providers such as ServerAstra and acquiring domain names through registrars including Njalla, is it likely that the attackers used servers under their control to validate tracking pixels sent to phishing victims before exploiting visitorsâ€™ browsers through fingerprinting?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used spearphishing campaigns with malicious Word documents.
- The attackers modified legitimate websites to inject malicious scripts.
- The attackers used browser fingerprinting to exploit visitors.

**Key Points from the Question:**
- The question asks about the use of servers under the attackers' control to validate tracking pixels before browser fingerprinting.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report mentions that the attackers engaged in spearphishing and used browser fingerprinting to exploit visitors.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of tracking pixels or the validation of these pixels on servers under the attackers' control.
- However, it is common in advanced cyber attacks for threat actors to use tracking pixels to confirm the success of their phishing campaigns and to gather additional information about the victims before proceeding with more sophisticated attacks like browser fingerprinting.

**Reasoning:**
- Given the sophistication of the attack, it is plausible that the attackers would use tracking pixels to validate the success of their phishing campaigns.
- The use of tracking pixels would help the attackers confirm that the phishing emails were opened and that the malicious Word documents were executed, which aligns with the initial access and execution tactics described in the report.
- The report mentions the use of servers and domain names, which suggests that the attackers had the infrastructure to support such activities.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**

The use of tracking pixels to validate the success of phishing campaigns before proceeding with browser fingerprinting is a plausible and common tactic in advanced cyber attacks. Given the sophistication and infrastructure described in the CTI report, it is likely that the attackers used servers under their control to validate tracking pixels.
