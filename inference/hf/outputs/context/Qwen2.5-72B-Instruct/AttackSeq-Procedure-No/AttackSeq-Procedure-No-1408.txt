### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Replaces legitimate KeePass binaries with trojanized versions, uses SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and employs MAILSLOT for C2.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to obtain credential information from `/etc/shadow` using the `shadow.py` module before gathering network and host configuration details for internal reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log passwords and tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to extract credentials. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. This aligns with the second part of the question.
   - **Specific Tool (`shadow.py`):** The report does not mention the use of `shadow.py` or any specific tool for accessing `/etc/shadow`. However, the use of `shadow.py` to access `/etc/shadow` is a plausible step for a threat actor to take after gaining elevated privileges, especially in a Unix-like environment.
   - **Sequence:** The question asks if obtaining credential information from `/etc/shadow` using `shadow.py` is likely to occur before internal reconnaissance. Given that FIN13 focuses on credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance, it is reasonable to assume that they would first ensure they have the necessary credentials before performing detailed reconnaissance.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries to log passwords, which is a form of credential harvesting.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** After gaining elevated privileges, it is logical for FIN13 to further harvest credentials, including from `/etc/shadow` if they are in a Unix-like environment.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Once they have the necessary credentials, they would then use native OS binaries and custom malware to gather network and host configuration details.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of operations and the focus on credential harvesting before internal reconnaissance, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
