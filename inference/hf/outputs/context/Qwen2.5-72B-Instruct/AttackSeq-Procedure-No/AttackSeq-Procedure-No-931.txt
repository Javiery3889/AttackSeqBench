### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, using advanced reconnaissance to know victims' whereabouts.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by posing as legitimate software updates and seeding P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Collection:** They collect secrets from browsers and email services, storing them in encrypted log files.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion only after deploying malware components such as downloaders, stealers, or advanced keyloggers during execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The report states that the Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, and uses 0-day exploits.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that they use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Collection:** The report indicates that they collect secrets from browsers and email services, storing them in encrypted log files.

   The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the report:
   - **Execution:** Deploy malware components (downloaders, stealers, keyloggers).
   - **Collection:** Collect secrets from browsers and email services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT first deploys malware components to execute on victims' systems.
   - Once the malware is deployed, they collect secrets from browsers and email services.
   - To evade detection, they use sophisticated techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files.
