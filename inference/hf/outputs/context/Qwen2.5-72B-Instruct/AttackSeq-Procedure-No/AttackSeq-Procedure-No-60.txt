### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events like COVID-19 fears.
- The emails contain links to websites offering these fake updates or exploiting current events for malicious purposes.

**Persistence:**
- Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Grandoreiro uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including:
  - Hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software.
  - Attempting to kill their processes.
  - Blocking them at the firewall level.
  - Changing file system paths to disable them.
  - Registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to execute with elevated privileges.

**Credential Access:**
- Grandoreiro steals credentials stored in Google Chrome and data stored in Microsoft Outlook.

**Discovery:**
- Grandoreiro collects information about the victim, including:
  - Computer name.
  - Username.
  - Operating system version and bitness.
  - Whether specific banking protection software is installed.
  - Lists installed security products.

**Command and Control:**
- Grandoreiro communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.
- It performs a handshake and checks for commands every few seconds.
- The first command received from the C&C server is a list of all currently connected victims, including collected information about their machines.

**Others:**
- Grandoreiro has been active since at least 2017, targeting Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and Spain.
- It is written in Delphi and has been rapidly developed, with several new versions each month.
- The malware authors focus on hiding the actual C&C address using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) and making the trojan modular.
- Grandoreiro's binaries are bloated to at least a few hundred megabytes, using binary padding with large BMP images in the resources section to make the files large and difficult to analyze.
- The malware also uses a spam tool for its distribution campaigns, which is believed to be written by the same authors as the trojan itself.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that Grandoreiro will restart a compromised machine in safe mode to evade detection before collecting information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Grandoreiro collects information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.
- It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions and evade detection, but there is no mention of restarting the machine in safe mode.

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not mention any technique where Grandoreiro restarts the machine in safe mode to evade detection.
- The malware's primary methods for evading detection include:
  - Hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software.
  - Attempting to kill processes of security software.
  - Blocking security software at the firewall level.
  - Changing file system paths to disable security software.
  - Registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to execute with elevated privileges.
- These methods are sufficient for the malware to maintain its presence and collect information without the need to restart the machine in safe mode.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed list of techniques used by Grandoreiro to gain persistence, escalate privileges, and evade detection.
- Restarting the machine in safe mode is not mentioned as one of these techniques.
- The malware's methods for evading detection and collecting information are comprehensive and do not require the additional step of restarting the machine in safe mode.

**Final Answer:**
- B: No
