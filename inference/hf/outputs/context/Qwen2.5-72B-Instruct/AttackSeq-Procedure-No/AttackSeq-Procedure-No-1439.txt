### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Logged into a public-facing system via SSH using a local account.
- Used port forwarding to establish RDP sessions to internal servers.
- Used VPNs to gain access to systems and persist in the environment.
- Exported saved passwords from users' Chrome browser installations.

**Persistence:**
- Used credential hopping to move laterally.
- Leveraged accounts with Delegated Administrator rights to access other O365 tenants.
- Configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
- Configured GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
- Added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new O365 Service Principals.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.
- Used renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
- Renamed systems to match the victim's naming convention.

**Discovery:**
- Used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to gather information from Active Directory.
- Regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe and probed external services.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.

**Collection:**
- Accessed data from Information Repositories.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the StellarParticle campaign will steal web session cookies from end-user workstations only after utilizing credential hopping and configuring malware such as TrailBlazer for WMI persistence.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Credential Access:** The threat actor stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.
- **Persistence:** The threat actor used credential hopping and configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
- **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order in which these actions were performed, but it does mention that stealing browser cookies was part of their defense evasion techniques.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Answer A: Yes**
  - This suggests that the threat actor will steal web session cookies only after using credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
  - The report does not provide a clear sequence indicating that stealing cookies is a step that follows credential hopping and WMI persistence configuration.
- **Answer B: No**
  - This suggests that the threat actor will not necessarily steal web session cookies only after using credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
  - The report indicates that stealing browser cookies is a defense evasion technique, which can be used at various stages of the attack, not necessarily only after credential hopping and WMI persistence configuration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report mentions that stealing browser cookies is a defense evasion technique used to bypass MFA.
- The report does not specify that this action is performed only after credential hopping and configuring malware for WMI persistence.
- The threat actor's use of multiple techniques in different stages of the attack suggests that stealing cookies can occur at various points in the attack lifecycle.

**Final Answer: B: No**
