### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. The initial shellcode located and executed a secondary shellcode stub, which then decrypted and executed an embedded payload.
   - **Execution:** The payload used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, which performed security product checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captured data about the infected system, stole files from removable media, and targeted Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrated various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to create mutexes and named events to avoid detection only after achieving persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into explorer.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the ResN32.dll library into the explorer.exe process.
   - **Evasion Techniques:** The report mentions that the malware's author took significant measures to avoid detection and analysis by the security community. However, it does not specifically mention the creation of mutexes and named events.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not provide a detailed sequence of actions that explicitly states the creation of mutexes and named events only after achieving persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the malware does take significant measures to avoid detection, the report does not specify that these measures include creating mutexes and named events only after achieving persistence.
   - The creation of mutexes and named events is a common evasion technique, but the report does not provide enough information to conclude that this specific action is performed only after achieving persistence.
   - The report focuses more on the persistence mechanisms and the data collection and exfiltration processes.
