### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Mustang Panda uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access vector involves phishing and watering hole attacks. The campaign uses filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers is done using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to deploy a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access vector involves phishing and watering hole attacks, and the execution phase uses a custom loader to exploit a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Control-Flow Obfuscation:**
     - The report mentions that the campaign uses anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage of the deployment process.
   - **UEFI Rootkit (LoJax):**
     - The report does not mention the use of a UEFI rootkit known as LoJax. The focus is on the use of custom loaders, side-loading vulnerabilities, and other techniques to execute and maintain persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by Mustang Panda, including initial access, execution, persistence, discovery, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - The report emphasizes the use of custom loaders and control-flow obfuscation but does not mention the deployment of a UEFI rootkit like LoJax.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report and the absence of any mention of LoJax, it is unlikely that Mustang Panda would deploy a UEFI rootkit before engaging in control-flow obfuscation.
