### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Both Moafee and DragonOK use similar TTPs and tools.
     - They use custom-built backdoors and RATs like CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy.
     - They use HTRAN to disguise their geographical location.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Primary attack vector: Spear-phishing emails.
     - Emails are well-crafted and tailored, with executable files or password-protected documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Evasion techniques: Environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents.
     - 'CPU core check' technique to detect and avoid virtualized environments.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registry entries for startup persistence.
     - 'Windows.reg' file is created and imported into the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Multiple techniques to evade detection: Environment-based evasion, large file sizes, password-protected documents, and 'CPU core check'.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - NewCT RAT uses POST network beacons with hardcoded headers and encrypted data.
     - Plugin functionality for additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development only after using environment-based evasion techniques, such as CPU core checks, to execute their payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing emails are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - Evasion techniques, including 'CPU core check', are used to execute payloads.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Custom-built backdoors and RATs are used after gaining initial access and executing the payload.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report:
       1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails.
       2. **Execution:** Use of environment-based evasion techniques (e.g., 'CPU core check').
       3. **Resource Development:** Deployment of custom-built backdoors and RATs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails.
   - After gaining access, the attackers use evasion techniques, including the 'CPU core check', to execute their payloads.
   - Once the payloads are executed, custom-built backdoors and RATs are deployed to maintain access and further the attack.
   - This sequence matches the order of operations described in the question.
