- The attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.
- After obtaining these details, they changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners.
- They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.
