### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Gholee malware campaign used a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file named 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb'.
- The file was not initially detected as malicious by any antivirus engines.

**Execution:**
- Upon enabling Macro content, the victim is presented with a message that disappears to show different content.
- The Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable within a function.
- These functions are combined to create a single PE file, which is saved as NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll.
- The PE file is executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process.

**Command and Control:**
- The Gholee malware establishes command and control by communicating with a Kuwait-based IP address (83.170.33.60) owned by German company iABG Mbh.
- It opens an SSL connection over port 443 using an expired digital certificate issued to Core Security for *coreimpactagent.net by Thawte certificate authority.
- The malware's HTTP communication pattern includes GET and POST requests to /index.php with specific parameters.

**Others:**
- Related incidents reveal another file 'svchost 67.exe' uploaded to Virus Total from Latvia, which communicated with an IP address in the same netblock as the Gholee malware.
- Detection and prevention measures include disabling macro code via GPO, blocking files containing macro code at the email gateway, and monitoring logs and proxy servers for communication with the malware-associated IP addresses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate, will the Gholee malware employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection only after the execution of the concatenated PE file NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection during the Macro execution phase.
- The PE file is executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process.
- The malware establishes a command and control connection using an expired digital certificate.

**Analysis:**
- The report indicates that the malware uses obfuscation techniques (ASCII character codes) and mechanisms to hide the process (ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32) during the execution phase.
- The command and control connection is established after the execution of the PE file.
- The question asks if the malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software only after the execution of the PE file and the establishment of the command and control connection.

**Conclusion:**
- The report clearly states that the obfuscation and hiding mechanisms are used during the execution phase, which is before the command and control connection is established.
- Therefore, the malware does not employ these mechanisms only after the command and control connection is established.

#### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
