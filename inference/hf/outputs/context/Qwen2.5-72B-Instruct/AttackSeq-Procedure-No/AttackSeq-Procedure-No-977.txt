### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document titled 'Job-Details.doc' delivered via LinkedIn messages.
     - The document contained embedded malicious macros that, when activated, initiated the infection process.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Persistence was established by the initial stage macros through a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter,' which was set to execute the second stage payload, SideTwist, every 5 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT34's campaign utilized DNS tunneling to avoid detection, with the initial macros stage using DNS requests to beacon back to the attacker and deliver victim identifiable information.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using HTTP on port 443, with port 80 as a fallback.
     - The backdoor used different techniques for outgoing and incoming communications, both encrypted using the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.
     - Commands were received from the server by searching for specific patterns hidden inside the HTML content of a legitimate-looking website, in this case, a fake Flickr page.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malicious macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access via a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered through LinkedIn messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access was achieved through a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered via LinkedIn messages.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the macros establish persistence through a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter.'
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The sequence of actions described in the report is:
       1. Initial access via the malicious Word document.
       2. Execution of macros.
       3. Establishment of persistence through a scheduled task.
     - The question asks if the macros will execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access, which aligns with the sequence described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the initial access is the first step, followed by the execution of macros, and then the establishment of persistence.
   - The question is asking if the macros will execute actions only after gaining initial access, which is consistent with the sequence described in the report.
   - Therefore, the answer is that the macros will indeed execute a series of actions only after gaining initial access.
