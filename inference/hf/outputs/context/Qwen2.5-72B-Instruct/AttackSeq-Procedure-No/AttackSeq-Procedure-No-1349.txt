### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps on Google Play.
   - **Execution:** The callCam app, once installed, hides its icon and executes in the background to collect sensitive information.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** SideWinder used device rooting and accessibility permissions for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, data encryption, dynamic code invocation, and overlay screens were used to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The callCam app collected extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server for downloading exploits and additional payload.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected data was encrypted using RSA and AES, verified with SHA256, and customized before exfiltration to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the callCam app sends the collected data to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase before encrypting it using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The callCam app collects extensive information from the device.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The collected data is encrypted using RSA and AES, verified with SHA256, and customized before exfiltration to the C&C server.
   - The question suggests that the data is encoded using a customized routine before encryption, which aligns with the CTI report.
   - However, the question also suggests that the encryption happens during the Collection phase, which is incorrect. Encryption and encoding happen during the Exfiltration phase, not the Collection phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the data is collected during the Discovery phase.
   - The data is then encrypted and encoded during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The question incorrectly places the encryption during the Collection phase, which is not accurate according to the CTI report.
