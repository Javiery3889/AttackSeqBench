### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A malspam campaign used a lure PDF with an embedded RTF file.
- The RTF file exploits CVE-2017-8579.
- The exploit leads to the download and execution of a file via an HTA file containing encoded PowerShell commands.

**Execution:**
- The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file, leading to the installation of ComboJack malware.

**Persistence:**
- ComboJack copies itself to a location on the victim's system.
- It uses `attrib.exe` to set hidden and system attributes to itself.
- It sets a registry key to ensure persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- ComboJack uses `attrib.exe` to set hidden and system attributes to itself, hiding the file from the user and allowing it to execute with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Impact:**
- ComboJack alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses, attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that ComboJack will store output from command execution in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory before replacing legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address and attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- ComboJack ensures persistence by setting a registry key and using `attrib.exe` to hide itself.
- It alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question introduces a new step: storing output from command execution in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory.
- This step is not mentioned in the CTI report.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that ComboJack performs an additional step of storing output in a .dat file, which is not mentioned in the report.
- **B: No** - This aligns with the information provided in the report, as there is no mention of storing output in a .dat file.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not mention any step where ComboJack stores output from command execution in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory.
- The report focuses on the persistence mechanism, defense evasion, and the impact of altering clipboard contents to redirect funds.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that ComboJack performs this additional step.

**Final Answer: B: No**
