### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email. These documents contained job offers and activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution:** The Lazarus Group executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher. They also used the Windows command line and the legitimate SQLite DLL library with a malicious exported function sqlite3_create_functionex for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The group created services using sc.exe and local administrator accounts, and placed shortcuts in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes and services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files, hiding malware in hidden folders, and using rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Discovery:** The group collected information about users, network settings, and processes using system utilities like net user, adfind, tasklist.exe, and systeminfo.exe. They also used the SMBMap utility to discover shared folders within the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with the C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to the C2 servers, which were disguised as legitimate domains and hosted on resources located in various countries.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will execute malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and leverage the SQLite DLL library before using system utilities like ipconfig.exe and net.exe to gather victim host information during reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report confirms that the initial access was through malicious documents containing job offers.
     - The group executed malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and leveraged the SQLite DLL library.
   - **Discovery (Reconnaissance):**
     - The report states that the group used system utilities like net user, adfind, tasklist.exe, and systeminfo.exe to gather information about users, network settings, and processes.
     - The specific utilities mentioned in the question (ipconfig.exe and net.exe) are not explicitly listed, but the use of similar system utilities (net user, tasklist.exe, etc.) is confirmed.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report. The group first gained initial access, then executed malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and the SQLite DLL library. After establishing a foothold, they used various system utilities to gather information about the victim's environment.
   - While the specific utilities ipconfig.exe and net.exe are not mentioned, the use of similar utilities (net user, tasklist.exe, etc.) for reconnaissance is confirmed.
