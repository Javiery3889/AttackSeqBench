### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The FIN8 group uses BADHATCH, a backdoor, to gain initial access. BADHATCH downloads and executes a script from a domain using a malicious PowerShell command.
   - **Execution:** BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode, executing various commands.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is achieved using WMI event subscription.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation is performed using a script (sh-tmp.ps1) that likely involves impersonating tokens of processes like lsass.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** BADHATCH uses TLS encryption, masquerades communication, and uses a proxy for encryption and redirection.
   - **Credential Access:** Credential dumping is performed using a script (mimi.ps1) that reads the memory of lsass.exe.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement is achieved using wmic.exe to create a process on the Domain Controller.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will perform anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks after performing credential dumping using a PowerShell script related to Mimikatz and reading the memory of lsass.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report clearly states that credential dumping is performed using a script (mimi.ps1) that reads the memory of lsass.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions various defense evasion techniques, including the use of TLS encryption, masquerading communication, and using a proxy for encryption and redirection. However, it does not explicitly mention anti-sandboxing or anti-virtualization checks.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report focuses on the techniques used to gain access, execute commands, maintain persistence, escalate privileges, evade detection, and move laterally. Anti-sandboxing and anti-virtualization checks are not mentioned as part of the attack sequence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, and lateral movement.
   - While the report mentions various defense evasion techniques, it does not specifically mention anti-sandboxing or anti-virtualization checks.
   - Given the focus on the attack sequence and the absence of any mention of anti-sandboxing or anti-virtualization checks, it is less likely that these checks are part of the attack sequence described in the report.
