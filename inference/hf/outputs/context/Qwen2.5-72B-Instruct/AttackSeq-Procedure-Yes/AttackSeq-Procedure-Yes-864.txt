### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - GreyEnergy targets energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland.
     - Activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, and password and credential stealing.
     - Focus on ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
     - Lateral movement from compromised web servers to other workstations.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Securely wipes malware components from victims' hard drives.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses stealth techniques like partial encryption, fileless execution, and selective module deployment.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Uses tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Deploys internal C&C proxies to redirect requests to external C&C servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses internal C&C proxies for stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that GreyEnergy operators will develop capabilities by creating and deploying a modular malware framework with functionality tailored for espionage and reconnaissance after achieving reconnaissance and performing data extraction, taking screenshots, and keylogging.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report confirms that GreyEnergy has already been performing reconnaissance, data extraction, taking screenshots, and keylogging.
   - **Modular Malware Framework:**
     - The report indicates that GreyEnergy uses a modular approach, with selective module deployment and partial encryption.
     - The use of a modular framework is consistent with the need for stealth and tailored functionality for espionage and reconnaissance.
   - **Stealth and Tailored Functionality:**
     - The report mentions that GreyEnergy focuses on stealth and has a modern toolkit with a greater focus on stealth compared to BlackEnergy.
     - The use of internal C&C proxies and fileless execution further supports the development of a modular framework for stealth and tailored functionality.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - GreyEnergy has already demonstrated a sophisticated and modular approach to their operations.
   - The use of selective module deployment, partial encryption, and fileless execution indicates a focus on stealth and tailored functionality.
   - The report explicitly states that GreyEnergy is a more modern toolkit with a greater focus on stealth, which aligns with the development of a modular malware framework.
   - The activities described (backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging) are consistent with the capabilities of a modular malware framework designed for espionage and reconnaissance.
