### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries use worms and scanning tools like masscan to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts.
     - They use public search engines like Shodan or Censys to find misconfigurations.
     - The function DOCKERGEDDON is used to scan netblocks and detect compromised Docker APIs.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Infrastructure analysis reveals IPs used for Kinsing malware and botnet communication.
     - Compromised websites store malicious files.
   - **Execution:**
     - Command and script interpreters are used to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
     - Tools like CURL or WGET are used to download scripts or binaries from remote sources.
   - **Persistence:**
     - LD_PRELOAD is used to hijack execution flow.
     - New user accounts with RSA keys are created for backdoors.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - HostPath mount is used to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Chroot is used to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Security software is removed to avoid detection.
     - Obfuscation techniques are used to avoid detection of malicious binaries.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Open-source tools are used to collect credentials.
     - New users are created and hidden.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Proxy tools like Ngrok are used for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Legitimate external websites are used as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - AWS credentials are exfiltrated over C2 servers.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining is the main objective.
     - Backdoors and malware deployments are also common.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will exploit misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access before using command or script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report clearly states that adversaries use worms and scanning tools to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts, specifically targeting misconfigured Docker APIs.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, the report mentions that attackers use command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the report aligns with the question: first, adversaries exploit misconfigured Docker API ports for initial access, and then they use command or script interpreters to execute malicious commands or binaries.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the initial step in the attack sequence is to use worms and scanning tools to detect and infect new vulnerable hosts, specifically targeting misconfigured Docker APIs.
   - Once the initial access is gained, the next step is to use command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands, scripts, or binaries.
   - This sequence is consistent with the question's proposed order of events.
