### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
     - They sent spear phishing emails with malicious links leading to the download of LNK or executable files.
   - **Execution:**
     - They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks/jobs to run malicious code.
     - Example: `sc create "SysUpdate" binpath= "cmd /c start "[file path]""&&sc config "SysUpdate" start= auto&&net start SysUpdate` to create a service.
   - **Discovery:**
     - They used multiple scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network environment.
     - Tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan were used with commands such as `hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443` to scan for NetBIOS name information and shared folders.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Earth Lusca is likely to use tools such as `net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig` to gather victim network information during the reconnaissance phase before using command interpreters and service creation to execute malicious code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that Earth Lusca gains initial access through spear phishing emails with malicious links leading to the download of LNK or executable files.
   - **Discovery (Reconnaissance):**
     - The report mentions that Earth Lusca uses multiple scanning tools to discover machines in the compromised network environment.
     - While the report does not explicitly mention `net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig`, these are common tools used for network reconnaissance and are often part of the initial discovery phase.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report confirms that Earth Lusca uses command and scripting interpreters and service creation to execute malicious code.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Earth Lusca uses multiple scanning tools for discovery, it is highly likely that they would use common network reconnaissance tools like `net`, `nltest`, and `ipconfig` to gather detailed information about the victim's network.
   - The sequence of using these tools for reconnaissance before executing malicious code aligns with the typical attack pattern described in the report.
