### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities.
- Successful exploitation led to the uploading of webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Persistence:**
- Deployed webshells and registered the custom backdoor 'IPsec Helper' as a service on compromised systems.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function.
- 'IPsec Helper' had functionality to update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts.
- Utilized publicly available offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Configuration file contained encrypted server addresses.
- Awaited commands from C2 servers, which included updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

**Impact:**
- Deployed wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD to destroy data.
- 'Apostle' initially failed to execute properly but was later turned into ransomware.
- DEADWOOD overwrote files with random data and had functionalities to prevent user access and ensure proper execution.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting public-facing applications to upload webshells and using RDP for lateral movement, is it likely that the backdoor 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized to exfiltrate data to C2 servers as part of its execution functionality?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploit public-facing applications.
2. **Persistence:** Deploy webshells and register 'IPsec Helper' as a service.
3. **Defense Evasion:** Use obfuscated webshells and 'IPsec Helper' to delete traces.
4. **Lateral Movement:** Use webshells to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts.
5. **Command and Control:** 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
6. **Impact:** Deploy wipers and ransomware.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that 'IPsec Helper' communicates with C2 servers over HTTP.
- The C2 communication includes commands such as updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.
- Sending recon information and downloading files are typical activities that can involve data exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is designed to communicate with C2 servers and perform various tasks, including sending recon information and downloading files.
- Sending recon information and downloading files are activities that can involve data exfiltration.
- Therefore, it is likely that 'IPsec Helper' would be utilized to exfiltrate data to C2 servers as part of its execution functionality.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
