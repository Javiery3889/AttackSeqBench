### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Targeted Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2021-44026) to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts.
     - Scripts redirected incoming emails, performed reconnaissance, and exfiltrated session and user information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access by exploiting Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730.
     - Also exploited Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397.
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious scripts through Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     - Redirected future incoming emails and performed reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumped OS credentials from compromised systems, including /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
   - **Collection:**
     - Created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an actor-controlled email address.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used web protocols and standard encoding for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated data over alternative protocols, including session cookies, address books, and database information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after accessing credentials, the BlueDelta campaign will perform discovery activities (system information and network connections) before collecting emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities to dump OS credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that the campaign performed reconnaissance activities, which can be considered a form of discovery. However, it does not explicitly state that these discovery activities were performed after credential access.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report clearly states that BlueDelta created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward emails to an actor-controlled email address.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI report suggests that after gaining initial access and executing malicious scripts, the campaign performed reconnaissance and exfiltration activities.
   - The credential access step is mentioned, but it is not explicitly stated that discovery activities (system information and network connections) were performed immediately after credential access.
   - However, it is logical to assume that after gaining credentials, the attackers would perform discovery to understand the system and network environment before setting up the email forwarding filter.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of TTPs and the context provided in the CTI report, it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign would perform discovery activities after accessing credentials before setting up the email forwarding filter.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
