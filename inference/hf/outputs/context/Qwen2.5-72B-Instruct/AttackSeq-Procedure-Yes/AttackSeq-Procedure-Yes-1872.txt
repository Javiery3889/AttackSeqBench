### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK) to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses various methods for persistence, including trojanized KeePass binaries and malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses techniques like ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FIN13 uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities like certutil.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses process memory dumping of LSASS and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 gathers information on network and host configurations, user accounts, and services.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** FIN13 uses proxies and various protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Mandiant will track FIN13 as a threat actor involved in gathering victim network information during the Reconnaissance phase before the group employs JSPRAT for local command execution and network traffic proxying during Execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention a separate Reconnaissance phase. However, the Discovery phase involves gathering information on network and host configurations, which is similar to reconnaissance.
   - **Execution Phase:** The report clearly states that FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying.
   - **Sequence of Events:** The report suggests that after gaining initial access, FIN13 would likely perform discovery (reconnaissance) to gather information before executing commands using JSPRAT.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** FIN13 gains access using web shells and custom malware.
   - **Discovery (Reconnaissance):** FIN13 gathers network and host information to understand the environment.
   - **Execution:** FIN13 uses JSPRAT for command execution and network traffic proxying.

Given the sequence of events described in the CTI report, it is reasonable to infer that FIN13 would perform reconnaissance (discovery) before executing commands using JSPRAT.
