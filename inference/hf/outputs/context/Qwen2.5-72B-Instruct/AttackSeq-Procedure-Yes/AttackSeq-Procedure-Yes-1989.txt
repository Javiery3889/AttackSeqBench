### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Creates an unnamed event object and two new threads.
     - Uses GetMessage to process messages and breaks the loop if the message is WM_ENDSESSION.
     - Creates an anonymous pipe and uses GetStartupInfoA to retrieve the STARTUPINFO structure.
     - Creates a new process to run the systeminfo command and reads the output via ReadFile.
     - Runs the tasklist command and reads the output.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses GetTempPathW to retrieve the %TEMP% directory.
     - Initializes WinINet functions with InternetOpenW, setting the user agent to "Opera".
     - Sets send and receive timeouts to 600 seconds using InternetSetOptionW.
     - Establishes a connection to the C2 server updaterweb[.]com on port 443 (or port 80 if it fails).
     - Uses HttpOpenRequestW to create an HTTP POST request handle and adds an HTTP request header.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Enumerates files and directories from the Desktop directory using FindFirstFileW and FindNextFileW.
     - Targets directories such as 'C:\Program Files', 'C:\Program Files (x86)', and user-specific AppData folders.
     - Uses SHGetFolderPathW to obtain folder names.
     - Retrieves the NetBIOS name of the local computer and the name of the user associated with the current thread.
     - Extracts the volume serial number of the root directory using GetVolumeInformationW.
   - **Collection:**
     - Base64 encodes the output of the systeminfo and tasklist commands, along with the list of targeted directories and their content, using CryptBinaryToStringA.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates collected information to the C2 server updaterweb[.]com using an HTTP POST request with the structure "id=<hostname>#Username#<Serial number in decimal>&current=1&total=1&data=<base-64 encoded data>".

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether SkinnyBoy is likely to communicate with the C2 server updaterweb[.]com to send exfiltrated data using an HTTP POST request after collecting base64-encoded outputs from the systeminfo and tasklist commands along with enumerated directory content.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that SkinnyBoy exfiltrates collected information to the C2 server updaterweb[.]com using an HTTP POST request.
   - The structure of the HTTP POST request is specified as "id=<hostname>#Username#<Serial number in decimal>&current=1&total=1&data=<base-64 encoded data>", which matches the collected data described in the Collection phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Execution Phase:** The malware runs systeminfo and tasklist commands and reads their outputs.
   - **Collection Phase:** The outputs are base64 encoded along with the enumerated directory content.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The base64-encoded data is sent to the C2 server updaterweb[.]com using an HTTP POST request.
