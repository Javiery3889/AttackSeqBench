### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
- SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
- Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

**Execution:**
- Malicious code was executed through various methods.
- 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
- 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).

**Defense Evasion:**
- Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit module.
- Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

**Discovery:**
- SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
- Network service scanning using tools like pscan and nmap.

**Collection:**
- SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.

**Command and Control:**
- SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
- C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
- RSA encryption was used to secure the AES key exchange for C2 traffic.
- Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the CostaRicto Campaign established communication with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP, is it likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel following the use of SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges for C2 communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The SombRAT backdoor communicates with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
- The traffic is SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing proxies.
- RSA encryption is used to secure the AES key exchange for C2 traffic.
- The SombRAT backdoor has capabilities for data collection and archiving.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that the SombRAT backdoor is capable of communicating with C2 servers using SSL-encrypted traffic and RSA-secured AES key exchanges.
- The backdoor also has the capability to collect and archive data.
- Given these capabilities, it is highly likely that the SombRAT backdoor will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel once communication is established.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The SombRAT backdoor is designed to communicate with C2 servers using secure and encrypted methods (SSL and RSA-secured AES).
2. The backdoor has built-in capabilities for data collection and archiving.
3. The use of secure communication channels (SSL and RSA) suggests that the data exfiltration is a critical part of the attack sequence.
4. The CTI report does not mention any limitations or restrictions on data exfiltration once the C2 communication is established.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
