### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
- Targets were defense and government-related organizations.

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
- The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
- The downloader retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.

**Execution:**
- The shellcode executed by the macro in winword.exe downloaded the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
- The payloads were executed using CreateProcessA() and ShellExecuteA().

**Persistence:**
- The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.

**Discovery:**
- The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, native system information, and OS product name from the registry.
- Additional information was decrypted during the reconnaissance process.

**Exfiltration:**
- The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 encoding.
- Data was exfiltrated to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

**Others:**
- The implant shares similarities with Lazarus Group attacks but may include false flags.
- The campaign targeted nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies globally, predominantly in the United States.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by decrypting and collecting network and system information, is it likely that it communicated with control servers via HTTP POST requests for command and control purposes?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Relevant Information from the CTI Report:**
- The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting various system and network information.
- The implant encrypted and obfuscated data using RC4 and Base64 encoding.
- The data was exfiltrated to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that the Rising Sun implant exfiltrated data to the control server using HTTP POST requests.
- This exfiltration is a form of communication with the control server, which is a common method for command and control (C2) purposes.
- The initial reconnaissance and data exfiltration are part of the same attack sequence, indicating that the implant likely used the same method (HTTP POST requests) for both exfiltration and C2 communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting network and system information.
2. The collected data was encrypted and obfuscated.
3. The data was exfiltrated to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
4. Given that the implant used HTTP POST requests for exfiltration, it is highly likely that the same method was used for command and control communication.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
