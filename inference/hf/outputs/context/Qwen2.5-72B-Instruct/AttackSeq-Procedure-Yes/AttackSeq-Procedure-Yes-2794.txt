### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed through spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events like COVID-19.
   - **Persistence:** Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses techniques like API hooking, killing processes, blocking at the firewall level, and changing file system paths to disable banking protection software. It also registers a binary as the default handler for .MSC files to execute with elevated privileges.
   - **Credential Access:** It steals credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Discovery:** It collects information about the victim's computer, including computer name, username, operating system version and bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed. It also lists installed security products.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with the C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Grandoreiro will collect information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products, after employing numerous tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments to evade detection and emulation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Tactic:** The CTI report explicitly states that Grandoreiro collects information about the victim's computer, including computer name, username, operating system version and bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed. It also lists installed security products.
   - **Evasion Techniques:** The report mentions that Grandoreiro employs various techniques to evade detection, such as API hooking and blocking banking protection software. While the report does not explicitly mention detection of virtual environments, the use of API hooking and other evasion techniques suggests a sophisticated approach to avoiding detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Collection of Information:** The report clearly indicates that Grandoreiro collects detailed information about the victim's computer, including operating system details and installed security products.
   - **Evasion Techniques:** The report describes several evasion techniques, including API hooking, which is consistent with the question's mention of "numerous tricks such as API hooking and detection of virtual environments."
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The sequence described in the question (collecting information after employing evasion techniques) aligns with the typical behavior of sophisticated malware like Grandoreiro. After gaining initial access and ensuring persistence, the malware would likely employ evasion techniques to avoid detection before collecting detailed information about the victim's system.
