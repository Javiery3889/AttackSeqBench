### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** It persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` at `/system/bin/netd` and checks if `init` is the parent process.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes files containing credentials and uses `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** It enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information. It also performs IP scanning of the local network.
   - **Collection:** It collects files from the local system and application directories.
   - **Exfiltration:** It exfiltrates files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to leverage its Command and Control (C2) capabilities such as providing SCP functionality, a local Socks connection, and an SSH server and client after performing discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report clearly states that Infamous Chisel performs discovery activities like enumerating data directories and performing IP scanning of the local network.
   - **C2 Capabilities:** The report mentions that Infamous Chisel includes utilities like `scp`, `ssh`, and `dbclient` (an SSH client). It also uses SSH connections for exfiltration.
   - **SCP and Socks:** While the report does not explicitly mention a local Socks connection, it does mention `scp` and `ssh`, which are key components of C2 capabilities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to C2 Transition:** After performing discovery activities, it is logical for the malware to leverage its C2 capabilities to exfiltrate the discovered data and maintain control over the compromised device.
   - **C2 Tools:** The presence of `scp`, `ssh`, and `dbclient` in the malware's toolkit strongly suggests that it is capable of using these tools for C2 purposes.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report explicitly states that Infamous Chisel exfiltrates files using SSH connections, which aligns with the use of C2 capabilities.
