### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Executes via a service (T1569.002)
- Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)

**Persistence:**
- Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)

**Defense Evasion:**
- Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
- Can timestomp files (T1070.006)
- Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
- Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
- Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)

**Discovery:**
- Obtains file and directory listings (T1083)
- Lists running processes (T1057)
- Obtains system information such as computer name, ANSI code page, OS version, and architecture (T1082)
- Obtains the local IP address (T1016)
- Obtains system time and time zone (T1124)

**Command and Control:**
- Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
- Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
- Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)

**Exfiltration:**
- Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)

**Others:**
- Targeted deployment, shares code similarities with NukeSped, and has been active since December 2018.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if Vyveva's backdoor is likely to:
1. Collect files from newly inserted removable media.
2. Notify the C&C about these files.
3. Compress the collected files.
4. Send the compressed files to the C&C server.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery:**
- The report mentions that Vyveva can obtain file and directory listings (T1083), which suggests it can identify files on the system. However, it does not explicitly state that it collects files from newly inserted removable media.

**Command and Control:**
- The report mentions that Vyveva exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041), which implies it can send collected data to the C&C server. However, it does not specify the type of data or the process of notifying the C&C about new files.

**Exfiltration:**
- The report confirms that Vyveva exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041), but it does not mention compressing the files before exfiltration.

**Additional Context:**
- The report does not provide specific details about the backdoor's behavior regarding newly inserted removable media or the compression of files before exfiltration.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Step 1:** The backdoor can obtain file and directory listings, which suggests it can identify files on the system.
- **Step 2:** The backdoor exfiltrates data to the C&C server, indicating it can send collected data.
- **Step 3:** The report does not explicitly state that the backdoor collects files from newly inserted removable media, notifies the C&C about these files, or compresses the files before exfiltration.

Given the lack of specific details in the report about these particular actions, the most plausible answer is that the backdoor is not likely to perform these specific steps.

**Final Answer: B: No**
