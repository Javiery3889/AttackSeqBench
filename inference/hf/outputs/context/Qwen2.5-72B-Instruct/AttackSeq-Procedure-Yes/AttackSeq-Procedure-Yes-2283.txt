### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Regin can use various infection vectors, including spoofed websites, web browser exploits, and application exploits. It was also observed to originate from Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin's execution is multi-staged, involving six stages, with each stage loading and executing the next.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not provide explicit details, but the multi-staged architecture and use of kernel drivers and EVFS containers suggest long-term persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Regin uses advanced techniques to conceal itself, including encrypted data storage in non-traditional areas.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic for credential information.
   - **Discovery:** Regin gathers information on processes and memory utilization, scans for deleted files, and retrieves them. It also monitors network traffic to IIS web servers and collects administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin's C&C operations are extensive and bidirectional, using various transport protocols and encrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Regin is likely to monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes after gathering information on processes and memory utilization and scanning for deleted files during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report explicitly states that Regin's discovery capabilities include:
     - Gathering information on processes and memory utilization.
     - Scanning for deleted files and retrieving them.
     - Monitoring network traffic to IIS web servers.
     - Collecting administration traffic for mobile telephony base station controllers.
   - **Network Traffic Monitoring:** The report mentions that Regin can monitor network traffic, which aligns with the question's query about sniffing low-level network traffic for collection purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase of Regin includes gathering information on processes and memory utilization, scanning for deleted files, and retrieving them.
   - The report also explicitly states that Regin can monitor network traffic, which is a key part of the discovery phase.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that Regin would monitor network traffic and sniff low-level network traffic for collection purposes as part of its discovery capabilities.
