### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign involved reconnaissance activities targeting various sectors.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained initial access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.
   - **Execution:** Used tools like Putty, Plink, and a VBScript for execution.
   - **Persistence:** Created local admin users and manipulated accessibility tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used tools like JuicyPotato and ProcDump with Mimikatz.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed tools rarely detected by antivirus and techniques to avoid VM environments.
   - **Credential Access:** Used Procdump and Mimikatz to dump credentials and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Discovery:** Developed 'STSRCheck' for mapping and used 'PORT.EXE' for scanning.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Used 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' for mapping and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Exfiltration:** Manually selected and exfiltrated valuable data using WinRAR or 7-zip.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign established command and control (C2) using tools like POWSSHNET, Ngrok, Serveo, and FRP after engaging in lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the campaign used 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' for mapping and accessing systems within the network.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The report does not explicitly mention the use of POWSSHNET, Ngrok, Serveo, or FRP for C2. However, it does mention that the attackers maintained access to networks using RDP over SSH tunneling, which is a form of C2.
   - **Contextual Information:** The campaign's focus on maintaining long-term access and using a variety of tools suggests a sophisticated and adaptable approach. The use of RDP over SSH tunneling indicates a method to maintain communication with the compromised systems.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of POWSSHNET, Ngrok, Serveo, or FRP, the campaign's sophisticated nature and the need to maintain long-term access suggest that they might have used additional C2 tools.
   - The use of RDP over SSH tunneling for maintaining access is a strong indicator that the attackers were capable of using other C2 tools to ensure robust communication channels.
   - Given the campaign's technical capabilities and the need to avoid detection, it is plausible that they would use a variety of C2 tools, including those mentioned in the question.
