### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll'.
     - Archive files with legitimate executables and malicious DLLs for DLL hijacking.
     - Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.
   - **Execution:**
     - Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Through 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
     - Injection into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Limited daily C&C server activity.
     - Fileless loading techniques.
     - Frequent changes in server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Gathers detailed system information, hostname, public IP, installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses HTTP and TCP protocols.
     - Sends collected data to C&C domain with XORed password.
     - Listens for additional commands from the server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor, after gathering detailed system information, hostname, and public IP during the Discovery phase, is likely to proceed towards creating/deleting files, taking screenshots, and other data collection activities as part of the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report clearly states that the Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system information, including hostname and public IP.
   - **Collection Phase:**
     - The report mentions that the Aria-body backdoor includes modules for USB data gathering, keylogging, reverse socks proxy, and loading extensions. These activities are typical of the Collection phase in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - After gathering initial system information (Discovery), it is logical for the backdoor to proceed to more detailed data collection activities (Collection).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor is designed to gather detailed system information during the Discovery phase.
   - The backdoor includes modules for various data collection activities, such as USB data gathering and keylogging, which are part of the Collection phase.
   - The logical progression from Discovery to Collection is consistent with the behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) like Naikon APT.
