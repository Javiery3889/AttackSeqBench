### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- The malware is a VBScript encoded script that, when executed, downloads a .doc file and opens it.
- This leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

**Execution:**
- The VBScript creates a shell object and executes a PowerShell command to run base64 encoded code.
- This code downloads and executes a .ps1 file from another URL.
- The .ps1 file contains more base64 encoded code, which, when decoded, reveals the infection code for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
- The malware masquerades as a 'Security Update' process and uses PowerShell to execute the base64 code.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicates with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15.
- The domain used for C2 communication is 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.

**Others:**
- The campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI).
- The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code.
- The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.
- The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian.
- The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After executing encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute payloads from URLs, is it likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize fileless techniques to avoid detection before establishing connection with the C2 server at 61.97.243.15?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attack uses VBScript and PowerShell to execute base64 encoded commands.
- The malware downloads and executes additional payloads from URLs.
- The malware masquerades as a 'Security Update' process.
- The malware communicates with a C2 server.

**Fileless Techniques:**
- Fileless techniques involve executing code directly in memory without writing files to the disk, which can help avoid detection by traditional file-based security solutions.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions the use of PowerShell and base64 encoded commands, which are common in fileless attacks.
- The malware masquerades as a 'Security Update' process, which can be a technique to avoid detection.
- However, the report also mentions that the malware downloads and executes additional payloads from URLs, which suggests that some files are written to the disk.

**Conclusion:**
- While the use of PowerShell and base64 encoded commands suggests some fileless techniques, the explicit mention of downloading and executing additional payloads from URLs indicates that the malware does write files to the disk.
- Therefore, it is not likely that the FHAPPI campaign would utilize purely fileless techniques to avoid detection before establishing a connection with the C2 server.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
