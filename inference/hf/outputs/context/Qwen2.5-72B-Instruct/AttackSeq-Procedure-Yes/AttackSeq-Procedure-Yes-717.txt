### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
     - The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word.
     - The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The macro executed shellcode that downloaded and executed the Rising Sun implant and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Rising Sun implant gathered system and network information, including network adapter details, computer name, user name, IP address, and OS product name.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Rising Sun implant will communicate with control servers via an encrypted channel using RC4 before exfiltrating data obfuscated with Base64 encoding to the control server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report states that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by gathering system and network information.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report explicitly states that the Rising Sun implant encrypted data using RC4 and obfuscated it with Base64 before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the Rising Sun implant performs the following steps:
     1. **Discovery:** Gather system and network information.
     2. **Exfiltration:** Encrypt data using RC4, obfuscate it with Base64, and exfiltrate it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
   - The sequence described in the question matches the sequence described in the CTI report.
