### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities like ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and net.exe were used for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened malicious documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using sc.exe and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders and removed from the file system.
     - rundll32.exe was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally on the network.
     - A data encryption algorithm was used to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Malware used HTTP to connect to C2 servers disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group used `net user` and `SMBMap` for network share discovery before leveraging compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions the use of `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance.
     - `net.exe` is a versatile command-line utility that can be used for various network-related tasks, including user management and network share discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts for lateral movement.
   - **Network Share Discovery:**
     - While `net.exe` can be used for network share discovery, the report does not explicitly mention the use of `net user` or `SMBMap`.
     - However, `net user` is a common command used to manage user accounts, and `SMBMap` is a tool used to enumerate and interact with SMB shares.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of `net.exe` for reconnaissance suggests that the attackers were familiar with using command-line tools for network exploration.
   - Given the sophistication of the Lazarus Group and their use of various tools and techniques, it is plausible that they would use `net user` and `SMBMap` for more detailed network share discovery.
   - The report does not explicitly state the use of `net user` and `SMBMap`, but the context and the group's known TTPs make it a reasonable assumption.
