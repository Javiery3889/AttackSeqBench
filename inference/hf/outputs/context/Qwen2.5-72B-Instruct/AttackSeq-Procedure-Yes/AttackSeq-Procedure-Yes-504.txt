### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
- SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
- Traffic was redirected from malicious domains to a proxy listening on a local port.
- Tunnel authentication was performed using the attackers' private keys.
- Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.

**Execution:**
- Malicious code was executed through various methods.
- 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
- PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection) used to inject the final payload DLL into memory.
- 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).

**Defense Evasion:**
- Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
- Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.

**Discovery:**
- SombRAT backdoor capabilities for process discovery, system information discovery, and system time discovery.
- Tools like pscan and nmap used for network service scanning.

**Collection:**
- SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.

**Exfiltration:**
- SombRAT backdoor exfiltrated data over the C2 channel.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the SombRAT backdoor performed process discovery and system information discovery during the Discovery phase, is it likely that the backdoor would communicate with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP to establish a Command and Control channel?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The backdoor uses a C2 channel for exfiltration.
- The initial access involved payload stagers using HTTP or reverse-DNS.
- The backdoor has capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that the backdoor exfiltrates data over the C2 channel, but it does not explicitly state the protocols used for C2 communication.
- However, the use of HTTP and reverse-DNS in the initial access phase suggests that the attackers are familiar with and capable of using these protocols.
- Protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a common technique for establishing C2 channels, especially in environments where direct connections might be restricted.

**Reasoning:**
- Given the use of HTTP and reverse-DNS in the initial access phase, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers might use similar protocols for C2 communication.
- The backdoor's capabilities for process discovery and system information discovery align with the need to gather information before establishing a C2 channel.
- The use of protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP is a plausible method for maintaining a covert C2 channel, which is consistent with the sophisticated nature of the CostaRicto Campaign.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
