### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The malware is initially delivered via an SFX executable that displays a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** The malware checks for Russian or Ukrainian input languages, decrypts an embedded resource, sets up a scheduled task, and collects system information.
   - **Persistence:** The malware sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses ConfuserEx for obfuscation and checks for anti-virus software.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects system information using WMI queries.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and WSHttpBinding() API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the keylogger component will collect keystrokes and clipboard data and store them encrypted in a folder under `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Component:** The report mentions that the keylogger component is not installed if any anti-virus software is detected. However, it does not specify where the keylogger stores its data.
   - **Storage Location:** The report states that the malware saves and encrypts parameters to a predefined location: `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\settings.dat`. This is different from the location mentioned in the question (`%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide information about the keylogger storing data in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Proof\Settings`.
   - The keylogger component is conditional and only installed if no anti-virus software is detected.
   - The storage location mentioned in the report for the malware's parameters is different from the one in the question.
