### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
     - They use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks for information gathering and victim compromise.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content that sends a 'ping' to the attackers' server.
     - Subsequent spear-phishing emails with MS Word documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or PowerPoint documents exploiting CVE-2014-6352.
     - Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a PowerPoint document containing a malicious artifact.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor used is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
     - Encoded blobs are downloaded and decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The backdoor steals Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Collection:**
     - The file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
     - Resilient communications are used, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Dropping Elephant threat actor will use UPX-packed backdoor malware to download additional malicious artifacts before evading detection by decoding the encoded blobs.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that Dropping Elephant uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report states that the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
     - The backdoor also downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Evasion:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention evasion techniques, but the use of UPX packing and encoding blobs can be seen as methods to evade detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that after gaining initial access through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, Dropping Elephant uses a UPX-packed backdoor to download additional malware.
   - The backdoor also downloads and decodes encoded blobs to PowerShell command line scripts, which is a form of evasion to avoid detection.
   - Therefore, the sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.
