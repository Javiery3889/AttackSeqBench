### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack started by compromising the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website (knf.gov[.]pl).
- The website code was altered to download malicious JavaScript files from compromised domains (sap.misapor[.]ch and eye-watch[.]in).
- This led to malware downloads on visitors' devices.

**Execution:**
- The malware, named gpsvc.exe, is a Win32 executable.
- It is packed with 'Enigma Protector' and drops a known Lazarus group malware variant.
- The executable can list service names, open or set events, and drop/install DLLs under specified service names.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses 'Enigma Protector' for defense evasion.
- It executes basic system information gathering commands and sends the results to the C&C server (eye-watch[.]in).

**Discovery:**
- The malware gathers system information, including hostname, user information, system version, network configuration, and active TCP connections.
- The results are sent back to the C&C server (eye-watch[.]in).

**Others:**
- Additional watering-hole attacks were observed on the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (Mexico) and a state-owned bank in Uruguay.
- The eye-watch[.]in domain was used in these attacks and has been associated with other malicious activities.
- A list of 255 IP address strings was found in the exploit kit website code, likely used to filter traffic and deliver exploits only to specific subnets, primarily targeting financial institutions in Poland and Mexico.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After discovering system information such as the hostname, user details, and active TCP connections, is it likely that the malware communicates with the identified C&C servers at IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218 using application layer protocols?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware gathers system information and sends it to the C&C server (eye-watch[.]in).
- The C&C server is identified as eye-watch[.]in, which is a domain name, not an IP address.
- The report does not explicitly mention the IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218.

**Reasoning:**
- The malware is designed to communicate with the C&C server using the domain name eye-watch[.]in.
- Domain names are typically resolved to IP addresses using DNS, and the malware would use application layer protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocols) to communicate with the C&C server.
- The report does not provide any specific information about the IP addresses 125.214.195.17 and 196.29.166.218, but it is common for malware to use domain names for C&C communication to avoid being blocked by IP-based firewalls.

**Conclusion:**
- Given that the malware communicates with the C&C server using the domain name eye-watch[.]in, it is likely that it uses application layer protocols to do so.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
