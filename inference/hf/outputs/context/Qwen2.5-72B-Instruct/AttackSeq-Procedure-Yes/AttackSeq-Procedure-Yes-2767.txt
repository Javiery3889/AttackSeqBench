### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The Dragonfly campaign conducted reconnaissance using spear-phishing emails, watering holes, and supply-chain technology exploits.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The attackers created or gained user accounts to operate stealthily within victim networks.
   - **Execution:**
     - The campaign used backdoor malware embedded within trusted software to execute code on victims' machines without detection.
   - **Persistence:**
     - They created or gained user accounts to maintain access to victim networks and used remote-desktop protocol for movement.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers incorporated code from the legitimate application TeamViewer into their backdoor to avoid detection and used self-deleting code to remove traces.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The group focused on Windows systems and used well-known practices to gather information and credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - They used remote-desktop protocol to move laterally among internal or external systems.
   - **Impact:**
     - The group has the ability to take offensive disruptive and destructive action, as seen in the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid by a BlackEnergy malware family.
   - **Others:**
     - The campaign has evolved since 2014, showing increased sophistication and precision in attacks. The group is likely after intellectual property or insights into the targeted sectors. Related attacks have targeted the pharmaceutical, financial, and accounting industries.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Dragonfly campaign will target energy companies with spear-phishing emails to gain initial access before executing backdoor malware embedded within trusted software to run code on victim machines.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions that the Dragonfly campaign used spear-phishing emails and supply-chain technology exploits for reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report does not explicitly state that the initial access is always through spear-phishing emails, but it is one of the methods used.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the campaign used backdoor malware embedded within trusted software to execute code on victims' machines.
   - **Targeting Energy Companies:**
     - The report mentions that the group has the ability to take offensive disruptive and destructive action, as seen in the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid. This suggests that energy companies are a potential target.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Dragonfly campaign has a history of using spear-phishing emails for reconnaissance.
   - The report indicates that they use backdoor malware embedded within trusted software for execution.
   - The group has shown a capability to target critical infrastructure, including energy companies.
   - The combination of these tactics aligns with the sequence described in the question.
