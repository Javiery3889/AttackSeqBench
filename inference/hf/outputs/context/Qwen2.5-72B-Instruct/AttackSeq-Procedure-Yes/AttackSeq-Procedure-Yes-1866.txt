### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a malicious Word document that uses the DDE technique to execute PowerShell commands.
   - **Execution:** The document uses DDE to invoke the command prompt, which then runs two PowerShell commands:
     - The first command downloads a string from a URL and executes it as an encoded command.
     - The second command is Base64 encoded and is found in the config.txt file received from the remote server. It downloads a file from a URL and creates a batch file and a registry entry for persistence.
   - **Persistence:** The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure the malware persists on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses and avoid detection.
   - **Others:** The document is distributed from a specific URL and downloads the Seduploader payload, which is a first-stage reconnaissance implant. The Seduploader profiles the victim's system and, if the system is of interest, installs additional malware like X-Agent or Sedreco.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malicious document is likely to contact a control server to distribute the first-stage Seduploader malware in a multi-stage command and control operation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The document uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands, which download and execute a payload.
   - **Persistence:** The document ensures persistence by creating a batch file and a registry entry.
   - **Control Server Contact:** The report mentions that the document downloads the Seduploader payload from a URL. This indicates that the document does indeed contact a control server to fetch the first-stage Seduploader malware.
   - **Multi-Stage Operation:** The report states that the Seduploader is a first-stage reconnaissance implant that profiles the victim's system. If the system is of interest, additional malware (X-Agent or Sedreco) is installed. This suggests a multi-stage command and control operation.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The document uses DDE to execute PowerShell commands that download and execute a payload.
   - The payload is the Seduploader, which is downloaded from a URL, indicating contact with a control server.
   - The Seduploader is a first-stage reconnaissance implant that profiles the system and, if the system is of interest, installs additional malware.
   - This sequence of events aligns with a multi-stage command and control operation.
