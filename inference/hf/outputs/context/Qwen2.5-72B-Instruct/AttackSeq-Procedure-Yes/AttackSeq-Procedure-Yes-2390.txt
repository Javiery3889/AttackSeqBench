### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade network security solutions.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware performed discovery activities by collecting system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using an encrypted channel after performing discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The malware has already performed reconnaissance and discovery activities, gathering detailed information about the infected host.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The report mentions that the C2 server used obfuscation techniques to evade network security solutions. Specifically, the C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade detection.
   - **Encryption:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state that the communication with C2 servers is encrypted, the use of obfuscation techniques suggests that the attackers are taking steps to avoid detection. Encryption is a common method to further secure C2 communications and evade network security solutions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware TDrop2 has already demonstrated sophisticated techniques to evade detection, such as process hollowing and payload obfuscation.
   - Given the level of sophistication and the focus on evading network security solutions, it is highly likely that the malware would also use encryption to secure its C2 communications.
   - Encryption would provide an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for network security solutions to detect and analyze the traffic.
