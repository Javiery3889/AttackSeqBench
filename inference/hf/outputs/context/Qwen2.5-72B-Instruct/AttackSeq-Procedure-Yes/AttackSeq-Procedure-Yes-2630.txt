### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files, and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, and enumerating running processes (including browsers).
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, compressing browser profile data, and setting up scheduled transfers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete is likely to target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores before collecting files from local systems and removable media.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report mentions that Machete enumerates running processes and gathers browser data such as bookmarks and stored credentials.
   - **Collection Activities:** The report states that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report indicates that Machete exfiltrates all collected files to remote servers, including browser profile data.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery and Collection Sequence:**
     - **Discovery:** Machete first enumerates running processes and gathers browser data, which includes stored credentials.
     - **Collection:** After discovery, Machete proceeds to collect various types of data, including files from local systems and removable media.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical for the malware to target and exfiltrate credentials from password stores as part of its discovery and collection activities. Credentials are valuable and can be used to gain further access or to exfiltrate more data.
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these activities, but the nature of the malware suggests that it would prioritize high-value data like credentials before moving on to other types of data.
