### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A Russian-language phishing campaign was active during the second week of August 2017.
- Targeted Russian banks with emails that appeared to be from disgruntled customers.
- The emails contained malicious attachments exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter, likely CVE-2017-0262.
- The attachments were docx files containing an embedded EPS image file with obfuscated code and a multibyte XOR key.

**Execution:**
- The exploit was delivered via docx files containing an embedded EPS image file.
- The EPS image file included obfuscated code and a multibyte XOR key.

**Command and Control (C2):**
- The report does not explicitly mention the establishment of communication with a compromised server for command and control.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that the Russian-language phishing campaign exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter through malicious docx files containing obfuscated code before the malware established communication with a compromised server located at IP address 137.74.224[.]142 for command and control?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The campaign used docx files with embedded EPS images containing obfuscated code.
- The EPS images exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's EPS filter.
- The report does not explicitly mention the establishment of C2 communication with a specific IP address.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the malware established communication with a compromised server for C2 after exploiting the EPS vulnerability.
  - The report does not provide explicit information about C2 communication, but it is a common next step after initial exploitation.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the malware did not establish communication with a compromised server for C2 after exploiting the EPS vulnerability.
  - The report does not provide explicit information to support this claim.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the campaign used docx files with embedded EPS images to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft's EPS filter.
- While the report does not explicitly mention C2 communication, it is a logical next step in a typical attack sequence after initial exploitation.
- The absence of explicit C2 information does not necessarily mean it did not occur; it is often a standard part of the attack lifecycle.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the logical progression of the attack and the common practice of establishing C2 communication after initial exploitation, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
