### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising, redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.
- It also uses compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
- This aligns with the Drive-by Compromise technique.

**Execution:**
- Upon successful execution, RIG EK runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
- Techniques used: Command and Scripting Interpreter and Exploitation for Client Execution.

**Defense Evasion:**
- RIG EK uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
- It has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.

**Command and Control:**
- RIG EK's infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server.
- The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS.
- The exploit server detects the user's browser and returns the exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

**Others:**
- RIG EK has been active since 2014, distributing various types of malware.
- It targets machines running outdated versions of Internet Explorer.
- It has intercepted victim traffic from 207 countries, with the most successful campaigns in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the Middle East.
- The highest exploit try rates and successful infections occurred on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
- RIG EK's operators have a close relationship with the developer of Dridex malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines and obtaining capabilities, is RIG EK likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malvertising: Redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.
   - Compromised sites: Injected exploit kit javascript.
2. **Execution:**
   - Runs an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware from the C&C infrastructure.
3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Uses proxy servers and has an integrated Antivirus testing feature.
4. **Command and Control:**
   - Infrastructure includes VDS, proxy servers, and an API server.
   - Exploit code is encrypted and served through a reverse proxy.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if RIG EK is likely to deliver exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.
- The CTI report clearly states that RIG EK uses malvertising to deliver exploits, which involves redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly mentions that RIG EK uses malvertising to deliver exploits, which involves redirecting users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.
- This aligns with the question's scenario of delivering exploits by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites using malvertising before redirecting users to its landing page.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
