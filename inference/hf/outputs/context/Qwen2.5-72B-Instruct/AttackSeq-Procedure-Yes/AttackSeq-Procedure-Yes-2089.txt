### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
   - **Execution:** The attackers downloaded and executed new payloads, ran shell commands, and deleted files.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group minimized detection by operating outside business hours and using single workstations as hubs.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise at least two more endpoints.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, collecting administrative level credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations.
   - **Collection:** The attackers collected and prepared valuable documents for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers exfiltrated documents related to internal applications and procedures.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before compromising and using the Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that the attackers compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, collecting administrative level credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations.

   Based on the report, the sequence of events is:
   - The attackers first obtained Domain Administrator credentials.
   - They then used these credentials to compromise additional endpoints.
   - During the discovery phase, they collected more administrative level credentials.

   The question suggests a different sequence where the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account. However, the report clearly indicates that the Domain Administrator credentials were obtained first and used to compromise additional endpoints.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report explicitly states that the attackers compromised Domain Administrator credentials and used them to compromise additional endpoints.
   - The discovery phase, where they collected more administrative level credentials, came after they had already compromised the Domain Administrator account.
   - Therefore, it is not likely that the attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials before using the Domain Administrator account.

### Final Answer
