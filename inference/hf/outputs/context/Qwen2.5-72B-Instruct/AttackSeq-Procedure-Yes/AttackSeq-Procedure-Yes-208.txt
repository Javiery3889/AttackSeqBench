### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera to drop malicious samples and acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install SparrowDoor and exploited the same vulnerabilities for execution.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry and installed SparrowDoor as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and file attributes.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that FamousSparrow will read file contents from the compromised systems as part of their Collection tactics before exfiltrating these files to their C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that SparrowDoor collected system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and file attributes. This indicates that the group is gathering detailed information about the compromised system.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report mentions that data is exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.
   - **Collection Phase:** While the report does not explicitly mention reading file contents, it is a logical next step after collecting file attributes. Reading file contents is a common tactic in the Collection phase to gather sensitive information before exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Logical Sequence:** After collecting file attributes, it is highly likely that the next step would be to read the contents of those files to determine their value and relevance before exfiltration.
   - **Common TTPs:** Reading file contents is a standard technique used by threat actors to ensure they are exfiltrating valuable data.
   - **Contextual Evidence:** The detailed information collected during the Discovery phase suggests a thorough and methodical approach, which would likely include reading file contents.
