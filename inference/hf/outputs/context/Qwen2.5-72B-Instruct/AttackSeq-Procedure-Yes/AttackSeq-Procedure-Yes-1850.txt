### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The malware is initially deployed via an SFX executable that displays a decoy document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware checks the installed input language for Russian or Ukrainian and continues to run if neither is found.
     - It decrypts an embedded resource using a brute force method.
     - It sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
     - It collects various information from the infected machine, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and installed anti-virus software.
     - If any anti-virus is detected, the malware does not install its keylogger component.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware establishes persistence by setting itself to run as a scheduled task every 30 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware uses ConfuserEx to obfuscate its code.
     - It checks for the presence of anti-virus software and refrains from installing the keylogger component if any is detected.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware collects various information from the infected machine, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and checks for installed anti-virus software.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicates with its C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and the WSHttpBinding() API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware will activate its keylogger component to collect keystrokes and clipboard data before communicating with its C2 servers using the WSHttpBinding() API.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger Component:**
     - The report explicitly states that if any anti-virus is detected, the malware does not install its keylogger component.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report mentions that the malware communicates with its C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and the WSHttpBinding() API.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware checks for the presence of anti-virus software and refrains from installing the keylogger component if any is detected.
   - Therefore, if an anti-virus is present, the keylogger component will not be activated.
   - The malware will still communicate with its C2 servers using the WSHttpBinding() API, regardless of whether the keylogger component is installed or not.
