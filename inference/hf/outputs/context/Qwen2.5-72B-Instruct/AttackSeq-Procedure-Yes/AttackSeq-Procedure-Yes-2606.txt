### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros to deliver NanHaiShu malware.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macro decodes and runs, writes JScript data to a file, and executes it. It also saves a decoy XLS file and sets up a VBScript to delete the original file.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the registry to ensure it starts automatically.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation to hide its code.
   - **Discovery:** NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with C&C servers using HTTP POST and GET methods to upload and download code.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after gathering and uploading system information, NanHaiShu is likely to receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Command and Control:**
     - The report states that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server using HTTP POST.
     - The C&C server is capable of communicating with the malware using HTTP GET to download and execute additional JScript and VBScript code.
   - **Purpose of Additional Code:**
     - The report mentions that the malware is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) capable of sending system information to a remote C&C server and executing additional code for potential data exfiltration.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The threat actor is believed to be of Chinese origin, targeting entities involved in the South China Sea dispute, which suggests a high level of sophistication and intent to gather sensitive information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The malware gains initial access through spearphishing and executes a VBA macro to set up the infection.
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** The malware ensures persistence and evades detection through registry modifications and code obfuscation.
   - **Discovery and C&C Communication:** The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server, establishing a communication channel.
   - **Additional Code Execution:** Given that the malware is a RAT and the C&C server can send additional code, it is highly likely that the malware will receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for exfiltrating highly sensitive data.
