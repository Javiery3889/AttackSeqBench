### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Both Moafee and DragonOK use similar TTPs, including custom-built backdoors and RATs (CT/NewCT, Mongall, Nflog, PoisonIvy) and a proxy tool (HTRAN).
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Similar custom-built backdoors and RATs, and the use of HTRAN to disguise geographical location.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Primary attack vector: spear-phishing emails with well-crafted, tailored content and executable files or password-protected documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Evasion techniques: environment-based evasion, large file sizes, password-protected documents, and 'CPU core check' to detect virtualized environments.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registry entries for startup persistence using 'Windows.reg' and 'regedit.exe /s Windows.reg'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Techniques to evade detection: environment-based evasion, large file sizes, password-protected documents, 'CPU core check', and large null-padded files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use the NewCT RAT to emit a network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data during command and control (C2) operations after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report confirms that the CT/NewCT implant creates and imports OS-specific registry entries to ensure startup persistence.
   - **Command and Control (C2):**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of network beacons with hardcoded header values and encrypted data. However, it is common for RATs to use such techniques to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Common TTPs:**
     - Both groups use a variety of evasion techniques and custom-built RATs, which suggests they are sophisticated and likely to use advanced C2 communication methods.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of the attack groups and their use of advanced evasion techniques, it is reasonable to infer that they would use sophisticated C2 communication methods, including network beacons with hardcoded header values and encrypted data.
   - The use of such techniques aligns with the overall pattern of their TTPs, which include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents to avoid detection.
