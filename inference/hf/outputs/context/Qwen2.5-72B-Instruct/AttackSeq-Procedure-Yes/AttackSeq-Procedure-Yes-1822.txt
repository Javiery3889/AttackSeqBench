### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Strategic web compromise (SWC) on the VFW website.
- Exploit code for a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322) was used.
- Victims were infected with ZxShell malware.
- Attributed to AURORA PANDA.

**Additional Activity:**
- Another adversary leveraged the same vulnerability a month earlier.
- Targeted French aerospace.
- Malicious iframe at savmpet[.]com redirected to gifas[.]assso[.]net.
- Exploit code and payload hosted on gifas[.]assso[.]net.
- Malware used: Sakula.
- C2 infrastructure: oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.

**Contextual Information:**
- DNS compromise of Safran's subdomain (secure[.]safran-group[.]com).
- Use of Sakula malware in both the recent French aerospace attack and the 2013 Capstone Turbine attack.
- Similarities: Use of Sakula malware, GIFAS-based domains, and zero-day exploits.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After AURORA PANDA leverages exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware during initial access through a strategic web compromise (SWC) on a U.S. organizationâ€™s website, is it likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com for command and control?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- AURORA PANDA used ZxShell malware in the VFW attack.
- Another adversary used Sakula malware and targeted French aerospace.
- The C2 infrastructure for the French aerospace attack was oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that AURORA PANDA used ZxShell malware in the VFW attack.
- The report also mentions that another adversary used Sakula malware and targeted French aerospace, with C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.
- There is no direct evidence that AURORA PANDA used Sakula malware or the C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com in the VFW attack.

**Reasoning:**
- The question asks if it is likely that AURORA PANDA will use Sakula malware and the C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com after the initial access with ZxShell malware.
- The CTI report does not provide any information suggesting that AURORA PANDA used Sakula malware or the C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com in the VFW attack.
- The use of Sakula malware and the C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com is associated with a different adversary targeting French aerospace.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**

The CTI report does not provide evidence that AURORA PANDA used Sakula malware or the C2 infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com in the VFW attack. Therefore, it is not likely that victim exploitation will use Sakula malware to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com for command and control.
