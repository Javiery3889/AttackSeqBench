### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which opens a decoy file and runs the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, and enumerating processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting data with AES, base64 encoding, compressing browser profile data, and exfiltrating data to remote servers over the same channel used for C&C. Scheduled transfers every 10 minutes. Data can also be copied to a removable drive if a special file is present.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Machete is likely to use standard FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its command and control (C&C) servers before implementing fallback channels for network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Details from the Report:**
     - Data is encrypted with AES and sometimes base64 encoded.
     - Data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C.
     - Scheduled transfers are set up to send data to the C&C server every 10 minutes.
     - Data can be copied to a removable drive if a special file is present.
   - **Standard FTP and HTTP Ports:**
     - Standard FTP ports are 21 (control) and 20 (data).
     - Standard HTTP ports are 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
   - **Fallback Channels:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of standard FTP and HTTP ports or fallback channels. However, it does mention that data is exfiltrated over the same channel used for C&C, which suggests a primary communication method.
     - The use of fallback channels is implied by the mention of copying data to a removable drive if a special file is present, indicating a secondary method of exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide explicit evidence that Machete uses standard FTP and HTTP ports for primary communication. Instead, it focuses on the use of a single channel for both C&C and data exfiltration.
   - The mention of a fallback method (copying data to a removable drive) suggests that Machete has alternative exfiltration methods, but it does not specify that these are standard FTP and HTTP ports.
   - Given the focus on a single, primary communication channel and the lack of mention of standard FTP and HTTP ports, it is more likely that Machete does not use these standard ports before implementing fallback channels.

### Final Answer: B: No
