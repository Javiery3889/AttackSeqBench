### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack begins with the Komplex Binder, which is an executable named 'roskosmos_2015-2025.app'.
     - The Komplex Binder saves a second payload, the dropper, on the system and opens a decoy PDF file.
   - **Execution:**
     - The XAgent component's main module, BootXLoader, checks for debugger presence and waits for internet connectivity before initializing communication with C&C servers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Komplex Dropper ensures persistence by creating directories and modifying file permissions.
     - The Launcher module within XAgent generates the malware's file path and re-executes itself.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The Password module within XAgent obtains passwords from Firefox browser profiles.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The InfoOS module gathers system information.
     - The RemoteShell module lists installed applications and iPhone backups.
   - **Collection:**
     - The FileSystem module manages files.
     - The CameraShot module suggests an intention to capture images.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with C&C servers is established by selecting a server from a hardcoded list, sending a hello message, and starting communication threads.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data is exfiltrated using the msgPacket structure, encrypted with RC4, and sent in POST requests to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Komplex Binder saves and executes a second payload on the system before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Komplex Binder:**
     - Saves the second payload (the dropper) on the system.
     - Opens a decoy PDF file.
   - **XAgent Execution:**
     - The BootXLoader module checks for debugger presence and waits for internet connectivity before initializing communication with C&C servers.

   Based on the CTI report, the sequence of events is:
   1. The Komplex Binder saves the dropper on the system.
   2. The dropper ensures persistence.
   3. The XAgent component initializes, with the BootXLoader module checking for debugger presence and waiting for internet connectivity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Komplex Binder is the initial entry point and saves the dropper on the system.
   - The dropper then ensures persistence.
   - After persistence is established, the XAgent component initializes.
   - The BootXLoader module within XAgent checks for debugger presence and waits for internet connectivity.

   Therefore, the Komplex Binder saves and executes the second payload (the dropper) before the XAgent component checks for the presence of a debugger.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
