### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - SideCopy targets government personnel in India.
     - Uses decoys and honeytraps to lure victims.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains.
     - Focuses on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, and loader DLLs.
     - Uses self-extracting RAR-based droppers and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploys RATs and plugins, including file enumerators, credential-stealers, and keyloggers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, and MSI-based installers.
     - Uses registry keys and VBScripts for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses decoy documents and images.
     - Clones legitimate websites to serve malicious content.
     - Targets Kavach to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Central motive is credential harvesting.
     - Targets Kavach and uses njRAT with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
     - Uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Uses themes to target military personnel.
     - Uses honeytraps and cloned websites.
   - **Collection:**
     - Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts.
     - Verifies requests from specific geographies (India and Pakistan).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy would target access credentials from Indian government employees using njRAT before using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report states that SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, specifically targeting Kavach.
     - They use njRAT with special victim IDs of 'kavach'.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions that SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the sequence of using njRAT before GoLang-based file recon plugins.
     - However, it is logical to infer that credential harvesting (using njRAT) would precede exfiltration (using GoLang-based file recon plugins) because the credentials are needed to access the Kavach authentication databases.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - SideCopy uses njRAT to target access credentials from Indian government employees, particularly those using Kavach.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Once the credentials are obtained, SideCopy uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate the Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - It is logical to assume that the credential harvesting (using njRAT) would occur before the exfiltration (using GoLang-based file recon plugins) because the credentials are necessary to access the databases.
