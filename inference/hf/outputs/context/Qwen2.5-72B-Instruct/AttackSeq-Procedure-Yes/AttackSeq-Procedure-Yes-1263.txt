### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader that employs ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.
- The group leverages Discord CDNs to host the subsequent stage script.

**Execution:**
- A PowerShell script loads a DLL into memory from an obfuscated and Base64 encoded string.
- The DLL contains a method named Bypass() to bypass AMSI.
- The script checks for and creates a registry key if it doesn't exist.
- It drops two files: a PowerShell script (myScript.ps1) and a batch file (SystemLogin.bat).
- A VBScript (Login1.vbs) is placed in the Startup folder to execute SystemLogin.bat upon system start.

**Persistence:**
- The VBScript (Login1.vbs) in the Startup folder ensures the execution of SystemLogin.bat upon system startup.

**Command and Control:**
- The final PowerShell script leads to njRAT, a remote access tool (RAT) that establishes command and control over the victim's computer.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if it is likely that after initial access is gained via a JavaScript downloader employing ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands, Blind Eagle will use PowerShell scripts that incorporate obfuscation techniques for defense evasion before placing a VBScript in the Startup folder to ensure persistence through system startup execution of batch files.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access:**
  - The report confirms that Blind Eagle uses a JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.

- **Execution with Obfuscation:**
  - The report states that the PowerShell script loads a DLL from an obfuscated and Base64 encoded string.
  - The script also uses a method named Bypass() to bypass AMSI, which is a form of defense evasion.

- **Persistence:**
  - The report confirms that a VBScript (Login1.vbs) is placed in the Startup folder to ensure the execution of SystemLogin.bat upon system startup.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access:**
  - Confirmed: JavaScript downloader with ActiveXObject to execute PowerShell commands.

- **Execution with Obfuscation:**
  - Confirmed: PowerShell script loads a DLL from an obfuscated and Base64 encoded string and uses AMSI bypass techniques.

- **Persistence:**
  - Confirmed: VBScript (Login1.vbs) placed in the Startup folder to ensure the execution of SystemLogin.bat upon system startup.

Given that all the steps in the question are confirmed by the CTI report, the sequence described in the question is highly likely.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
