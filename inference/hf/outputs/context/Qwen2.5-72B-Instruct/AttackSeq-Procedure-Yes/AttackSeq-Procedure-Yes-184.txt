### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** It persists by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path /system/bin/netd.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information and uses tcpdump to monitor network traffic.
   - **Collection:** It automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** It provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to SSH.
   - **Exfiltration:** It exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate netd, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to perform file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories before collecting files from local systems and application directories containing communication data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Infamous Chisel persists by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path /system/bin/netd.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Infamous Chisel's netd component automatically collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **File and Directory Discovery:** The report does not explicitly state that Infamous Chisel performs file and directory discovery by enumerating data directories before collecting files. However, the collection of files from specific directories implies that it must have some mechanism to identify and locate these files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The collection of files from application and data directories containing communication data suggests that Infamous Chisel must have a way to discover and identify these directories.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention file and directory discovery, it is a logical step in the process of collecting files from specific directories.
   - Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Infamous Chisel performs file and directory discovery as part of its collection process.
