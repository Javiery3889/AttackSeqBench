### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 uses a python script to generate random IPs and a database to centralize data.
     - Scan bots are geographically distributed across the United States, United Kingdom, and Bulgaria.
     - These bots probe potential victims and report back to a Django application for administration and reporting.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents, phishing websites, and malicious iFrames.
     - The first stage of the attack involves a dropper named runrun.exe, which contacts the C&C server and downloads the second stage component.
   - **Execution:**
     - The second stage component, installed by winloat.exe, writes key components to the disk and deploys tools like a password dumper, privilege escalation tool, and proxy tool.
   - **Persistence:**
     - APT28 changes file timestamps to hide files from victims.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT28 uses a tool exploiting CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool to contact systems behind routers.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - APT28 deploys a password dumping tool based on mimikatz.
   - **Collection:**
     - APT28 collects data using additional modules and uploads stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - APT28's C&C communication is via HTTP on port 443 or 80, and can be encrypted using 3DES and RSA.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - APT28 exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to use geographically distributed bots to report back to a central server during its discovery process after gaining initial access and executing a dropper.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - APT28 uses geographically distributed bots to scan and report back to a central server during the reconnaissance phase.
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - APT28 gains initial access through spear phishing and executes a dropper to enable system compromise.
   - **Discovery Process:**
     - The question specifically asks about the discovery process, which is not explicitly detailed in the report. However, the use of geographically distributed bots and a central server for reporting is a consistent pattern in the reconnaissance phase.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - APT28's C&C communication is via HTTP on port 443 or 80, and can be encrypted, indicating a structured and distributed communication network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT28 uses geographically distributed bots for reconnaissance, which suggests a distributed and coordinated approach.
   - The initial access and execution phases involve a dropper that contacts the C&C server, indicating a structured communication network.
   - The use of a central server for administration and reporting in the reconnaissance phase suggests that APT28 maintains a similar infrastructure for other phases of the attack.
   - The C&C communication is structured and can be encrypted, further supporting the use of a distributed network.
