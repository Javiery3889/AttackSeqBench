### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Gamaredon APT group used targeted emails with malicious document files.
- The emails leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure.
- The documents used a template injection technique to load a document template from the internet, which contained malicious macro codes.

**Execution:**
- Upon opening the document, the embedded macro code executed a VBScript (VBS) named 'PlayList.vbs'.
- The VBS was dropped into the '%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer' directory and executed using 'wscript.exe'.

**Persistence:**
- The VBS script registered a RUN key in the Windows registry to ensure its execution at every system startup.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The VBS script used obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
- The VBS script was designed to delete itself after execution to further avoid detection.

**Others:**
- The Gamaredon APT group has been active since 2013, primarily targeting Ukrainian government institutions.
- The group's activities were tracked from late 2019 to February 2020.
- The IP addresses used for the attack infrastructure were linked to Russian hosting companies, suggesting the use of rented Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for the attacks.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After employing obfuscation within a VBS script for defense evasion and configuring the script to delete itself post-execution, is it likely that the VBS script will communicate with a command and control (C&C) server located at 'hxxp://kristom[.]hopto[.]org/{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serious number}/help_05_03[.]php'?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The VBS script used obfuscation and deleted itself after execution.
- The report does not explicitly mention any C&C communication.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that the VBS script communicates with a C&C server.
  - The report does not provide any information about C&C communication, which is a critical step in many APT attacks.
  - However, it is common for APT groups to establish C&C communication to maintain control over the compromised system.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that the VBS script does not communicate with a C&C server.
  - The report does not mention any C&C communication, which aligns with this choice.
  - However, the absence of explicit mention does not necessarily mean it did not happen, as C&C communication is a common tactic in APT attacks.

**Reasoning:**
- While the report does not explicitly state that the VBS script communicates with a C&C server, it is a common practice in APT attacks to establish such communication.
- The use of obfuscation and self-deletion techniques suggests that the attackers are trying to maintain a low profile and avoid detection, which is consistent with the need for C&C communication to control the compromised system.
- The IP addresses linked to Russian hosting companies and the use of VPS suggest that the attackers have the infrastructure to set up C&C servers.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the common practice of APT groups to establish C&C communication and the sophisticated techniques used in the attack, it is likely that the VBS script would communicate with a C&C server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
