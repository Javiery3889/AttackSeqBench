### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Automatic listing of interesting files.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injection of macros into documents and email propagation.
   - **Collection:** Search for sensitive documents, scanning all drives, and taking screenshots every minute.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will use HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control (C&C) communication before transferring harvested documents to the C&C server for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that "Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server." This indicates that the exfiltration process involves transferring data to the C&C server.
   - **C&C Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the protocols used for C&C communication. However, it is common for malware to use HTTP and HTTPS for C&C communication due to their widespread use and ability to blend in with normal traffic.
   - **Contextual Information:** The group uses a variety of domains for C&C servers, both free and paid, and changes them frequently. This suggests that they are likely to use common protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to maintain communication with their C&C infrastructure.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the common practice of using HTTP and HTTPS for C&C communication and the group's frequent changes to C&C domains, it is reasonable to assume that Gamaredon's malware uses these protocols for C&C communication.
   - The report's mention of automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server aligns with the use of these protocols for exfiltration.
