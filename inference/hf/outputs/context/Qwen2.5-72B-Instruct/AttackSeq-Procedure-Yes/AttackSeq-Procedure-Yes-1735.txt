### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign targeted various sectors and used infrastructure for long-term access and information theft.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in VPN services.
   - **Execution:** Used tools like Putty, Plink, and VBScript for execution.
   - **Persistence:** Created local admin users and manipulated accessibility tools.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Used JuicyPotato and legitimate tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz for credential theft.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employed tools rarely detected by antivirus and techniques to avoid VM environments.
   - **Credential Access:** Used Procdump and Mimikatz to dump credentials and 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Discovery:** Used 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' for network mapping and scanning.
   - **Command and Control:** Established C2 using 'POWSSHNET' for RDP over SSH tunneling and other tools.
   - **Exfiltration:** Compressed and exfiltrated valuable data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Fox Kitten Campaign will use 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks for lateral movement before establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the campaign used 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE' for network discovery.
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that the campaign used 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement:** While not explicitly mentioned, the use of pass-the-hash attacks is a common technique for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** The report confirms the use of 'POWSSHNET' for RDP over SSH tunneling for C2.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report.
   - After discovering the network using 'STSRCheck' and 'PORT.EXE', it is logical for the attackers to use 'Invoke the Hash' for pass-the-hash attacks to gain additional access and move laterally within the network.
   - Establishing RDP connections over SSH tunneling using 'POWSSHNET' for C2 is a subsequent step that follows the lateral movement.
