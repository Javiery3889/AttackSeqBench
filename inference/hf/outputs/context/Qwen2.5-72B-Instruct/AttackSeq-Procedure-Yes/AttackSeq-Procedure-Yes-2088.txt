### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures after business hours or on weekends.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents.
   - **Execution:** The adversary downloaded and executed new payloads, ran shell commands, and deleted files.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence using a backdoor from the Command and Control Server.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers aimed to find admin-level credentials and compromised a Domain Administrator account.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group minimized detection by operating outside business hours and using single workstations as a hub.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers compromised credentials for a Domain Administrator and used them to compromise more endpoints.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, collecting administrative credentials and compromising additional endpoints.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike beacon was used for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers prepared and collected documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Carbanak group moved laterally across the infrastructure targeting internal hosts and servers before preparing and collecting documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network, collecting administrative credentials and compromising additional endpoints.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After discovery, the report mentions that the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report then states that the attackers prepared and collected documents related to internal applications and procedures for exfiltration.

   The sequence in the report is:
   - Discovery (using Cobalt Strike beacon)
   - Lateral Movement (targeting internal hosts and servers)
   - Exfiltration (preparing and collecting documents)

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the discovery phase involved using the Cobalt Strike beacon to map the internal network and collect credentials.
   - After discovery, the attackers moved laterally across the infrastructure, targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - Finally, the attackers prepared and collected documents for exfiltration.

   This sequence aligns with the question's proposed sequence:
   - Discovery (using Cobalt Strike beacon)
   - Lateral Movement (targeting internal hosts and servers)
   - Exfiltration (preparing and collecting documents)

### Final Answer
