### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** They used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket tools).
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used a custom Mimikatz variant and Dumpert to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They moved laterally using webshells and Impacket's atexec with dumped credentials.
   - **Command and Control:** They used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate and run commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will run commands to perform permission groups discovery before moving laterally using AntSword webshells and Impacket atexec.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report indicates that the actors used the webshell to run commands for initial system and user discovery. This suggests they were gathering information about the environment.
   - **Credential Access:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They moved laterally using webshells and Impacket's atexec with the dumped credentials.
   - **Permission Groups Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention running commands to discover permission groups. However, it is a logical step in the attack sequence to understand the permissions and roles of the compromised accounts before moving laterally.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **System and User Discovery:** The report mentions that the actors used the webshell to run commands for initial system and user discovery. This is a broad term that could include permission groups discovery.
   - **Logical Sequence:** After dumping credentials and using pass-the-hash, it is logical for the actors to discover permission groups to understand the level of access they have and to identify high-value targets for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that they moved laterally using webshells and Impacket atexec. This implies that they had the necessary information to do so, which could include permission groups.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of the attack and the need to understand the permissions of the compromised accounts before moving laterally, it is likely that the threat actors would run commands to perform permission groups discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
