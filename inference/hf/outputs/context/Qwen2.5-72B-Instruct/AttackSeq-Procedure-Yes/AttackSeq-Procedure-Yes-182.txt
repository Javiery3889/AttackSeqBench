### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Discovery:** The netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Collection:** The netd component collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories.
   - **Command and Control:** The db component provides SCP functionality, and td provides a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to SSH.
   - **Exfiltration:** The netd component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** Replacing the legitimate netd can impact the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel will deploy tcpdump to sniff network interfaces and monitor network traffic before exfiltrating files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Collection:** The report mentions that the netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, and gathers system information. It also collects files from the local system and application/data directories.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that the netd component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Network Sniffing (tcpdump):** The report does not explicitly mention the use of tcpdump or any other network sniffing tool. However, the malware does perform IP scanning of the local network to discover other devices, which suggests some level of network activity monitoring.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of activities, including discovery, collection, and exfiltration. While network scanning is mentioned, the use of tcpdump for network sniffing is not explicitly stated.
   - The primary focus of the malware seems to be on file discovery, collection, and exfiltration using Tor and SSH.
   - Deploying tcpdump to sniff network interfaces would be an additional step that is not mentioned in the report, and it is not a necessary part of the described attack sequence.
