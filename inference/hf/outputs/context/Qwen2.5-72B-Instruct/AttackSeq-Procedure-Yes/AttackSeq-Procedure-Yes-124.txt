### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Exploited public-facing applications.
- Used FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities.
- Uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Deployed custom malware, including the .NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper'.
- 'IPsec Helper' was used for data exfiltration and deploying additional malware.
- Registered as a service for persistence.
- Could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on C2 commands.

**Persistence:**
- Deployed webshells.
- Registered 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, obfuscated with custom base64 encoding.
- 'IPsec Helper' could update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used webshells to tunnel RDP traffic.
- Leveraged compromised accounts and offensive security tools for credential harvesting and lateral movement.

**Command and Control:**
- 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
- Configuration file contained encrypted server addresses.
- Awaited commands for updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that Agrius eventually deployed wipers like 'Apostle', which later turned into functioning ransomware, to destroy data on targeted systems.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Agrius used 'IPsec Helper' for various malicious activities, including data exfiltration and deploying additional malware.
- The backdoor could execute commands from C2 servers, including updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.
- The report does not explicitly mention the deployment of wipers or ransomware.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This choice suggests that Agrius likely deployed wipers or ransomware.
  - The report does not provide direct evidence of wipers or ransomware deployment.
  - However, the backdoor's capabilities (downloading files, executing commands) could potentially be used to deploy such malware.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Agrius did not deploy wipers or ransomware.
  - The report does not mention wipers or ransomware, which makes this choice more aligned with the provided information.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not explicitly state that Agrius deployed wipers or ransomware.
- While the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor has the capability to download and execute additional malware, the report does not provide evidence that this capability was used to deploy wipers or ransomware.
- Given the lack of direct evidence, the most plausible answer is that Agrius did not deploy wipers or ransomware based on the information provided.

**Final Answer: B: No**
