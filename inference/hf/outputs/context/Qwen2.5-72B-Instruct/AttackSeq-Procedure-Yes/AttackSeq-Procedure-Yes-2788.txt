### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware (XAgent) is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware for Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- On iOS 7, the XAgent app:
  - Hides its icon.
  - Runs in the background immediately.
  - Restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the app:
  - Does not hide its icon.
  - Cannot restart automatically.

**Command and Control:**
- Collects information from the iOS device.
- Sends information out via HTTP using POST requests.
- Receives commands via HTTP using GET requests.
- Uses a randomly generated URI for C&C HTTP requests.
- Uses a token (Base64 encoded with a 5-byte random prefix) to identify which module is communicating.
- Can upload files via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the XAgent app will collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine before sending the collected data out via HTTP to its C&C server.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The app collects information from the iOS device.
- It sends this information out via HTTP.
- The information is sent using POST requests.
- The app uses a C&C server for communication.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report mentions that the app collects information from the iOS device and sends it out via HTTP.
  - While the report does not explicitly state that geo-location data is collected, it is reasonable to infer that "information" could include geo-location data, as this is a common type of data collected by malware for reconnaissance and tracking purposes.
- **B: No**
  - This choice would be correct if the report explicitly stated that geo-location data is not collected, but it does not provide such a statement.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the XAgent app collects information from the iOS device and sends it to a C&C server via HTTP.
- While the report does not specify the exact types of information collected, it is common for malware to collect geo-location data as part of its discovery routine.
- Given the advanced nature of the malware and its capabilities, it is reasonable to infer that geo-location data could be part of the collected information.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
