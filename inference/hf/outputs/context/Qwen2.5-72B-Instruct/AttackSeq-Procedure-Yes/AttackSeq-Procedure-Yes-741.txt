### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Command and Control (C&C):**
  - The Desert Falcons operated three campaigns using different C&C/IPs.
  - Campaigns targeted various victim types, including government organizations, military centers, top media outlets, and activists.
  - They used homemade backdoors for full access and control, including the Falcons' main Trojan and DHS spyware.
  - Functionalities of the backdoors included screenshots, keylogs, file upload/download, password stealing, and audio recording.

- **Others:**
  - The group began operations in 2011 with infections traced back to 2013.
  - They developed malware targeting Windows and Android devices.
  - Victims included military, government, media, financial institutions, research and education institutions, activists, political leaders, energy firms, and physical security companies.
  - The group used various infection vectors.
  - They stole over one million files containing sensitive information.
  - Kaspersky Lab's investigation identified some group members as native Arabic speakers from the Middle East.
  - The group is expected to continue developing Trojans and using more advanced techniques.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After the Desert Falcons operated campaigns targeting high-profile victims using homemade backdoors for Command and Control activities like keylogging and password stealing, is it likely that they conducted spear phishing emails and social engineering techniques to achieve Initial Access?

- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the CTI Report:**
  - The report mentions that the Desert Falcons used various infection vectors.
  - The group targeted high-profile victims and used sophisticated backdoors for C&C activities.
  - The functionalities of the backdoors include keylogging and password stealing, which are typically used after gaining initial access.

- **Initial Access Techniques:**
  - The report does not explicitly state the initial access methods used by the Desert Falcons.
  - However, given that the group targeted high-profile victims and used sophisticated backdoors, it is reasonable to infer that they would use advanced techniques to gain initial access.
  - Spear phishing and social engineering are common initial access techniques used by sophisticated threat actors to compromise high-profile targets.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The Desert Falcons targeted high-profile victims, which suggests they used sophisticated and targeted methods to gain initial access.
  - The use of various infection vectors implies that they employed multiple techniques to compromise their targets.
  - Spear phishing and social engineering are effective methods for gaining initial access to high-profile targets, especially when combined with the use of sophisticated backdoors for C&C activities.
  - Given the group's history and the nature of their targets, it is highly likely that they used spear phishing and social engineering to achieve initial access.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
