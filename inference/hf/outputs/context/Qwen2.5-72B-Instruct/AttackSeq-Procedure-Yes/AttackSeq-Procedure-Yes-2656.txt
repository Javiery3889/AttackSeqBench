### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant by exploiting a side-loading vulnerability.
   - **Persistence:** The malware creates hidden system directories and sets up persistence via scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with initial handshakes over HTTPS or TCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug is likely to proceed with data exfiltration via an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol after gathering data from network shared drives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that Korplug collects extensive information about the system, including uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, amount of RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report confirms that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom TCP-based protocol used for C&C communication, which is encrypted using RC4.
   - **Network Shared Drives:** The report does not explicitly mention the collection of data from network shared drives, but it does mention the collection of extensive system information, which could include network shared drives.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that Korplug collects extensive system information and exfiltrates data using an encrypted custom TCP-based protocol.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that Korplug collects data from network shared drives, it is reasonable to infer that the malware's comprehensive data collection capabilities would include network shared drives.
   - Given the malware's sophisticated nature and the detailed information it collects, it is highly likely that it would also gather data from network shared drives and exfiltrate it using the same protocol.
