### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Mustang Panda uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access vector involves phishing and watering hole attacks. The campaign uses filenames related to current events to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** The campaign utilizes a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden directory and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Discovery:** The malware collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Mustang Panda is likely to execute the Korplug malware through a DLL side-loading vulnerability before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that the initial access vector involves phishing and watering hole attacks, and the downloader opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** The report states that the campaign uses a custom loader to execute the new Korplug variant. The loader is a DLL that exploits a side-loading vulnerability in a legitimate, signed executable.
   - **Control-Flow Obfuscation:** The report mentions that the campaign is characterized by the use of anti-analysis techniques and control-flow obfuscation at every stage of the deployment process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the custom loader, which is a DLL, exploits a side-loading vulnerability to execute the Korplug malware.
   - The report also mentions that the campaign uses control-flow obfuscation at every stage of the deployment process, which includes the execution stage.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the group will execute the Korplug malware through a DLL side-loading vulnerability before engaging in control-flow obfuscation for defense evasion.
