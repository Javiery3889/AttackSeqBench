### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware (XAgent) is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Command and Control:**
- The app collects information from the iOS device.
- It sends information out via HTTP using POST requests.
- It receives commands via HTTP using GET requests.
- The log messages are color-coded for human readability.
- The full URI for C&C HTTP requests is randomly generated.
- The token used for communication is Base64 encoded with a 5-byte random prefix.
- The app can also upload files via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the XAgent app executes by hiding its icon and running in the background on iOS 7 devices, is it likely that the app will collect a list of processes for discovery before sending the gathered information, including the processes data, out via HTTP to the C2 server?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The app runs in the background and restarts immediately if terminated.
- It collects information from the device.
- It sends information out via HTTP using POST requests.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that the app collects information from the device and sends it out via HTTP.
- However, it does not explicitly state that the app collects a list of processes for discovery before sending the information.
- The app's primary function is to collect and send information, but the specific details of what information is collected (e.g., process list) are not clearly stated.

**Reasoning:**
- Given that the app is designed to run in the background and collect information, it is plausible that it might collect a list of processes as part of its data collection.
- However, the report does not provide explicit evidence that the app specifically collects a list of processes before sending the information.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report indicates that the app collects and sends information, but it does not specify the exact types of information collected.
- While it is possible that the app collects a list of processes, the report does not provide direct evidence to support this.
- Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not definitively clear that the app collects a list of processes before sending the information.

**Final Answer: B: No**
