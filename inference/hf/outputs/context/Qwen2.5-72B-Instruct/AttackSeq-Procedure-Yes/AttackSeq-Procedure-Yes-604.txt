### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Attackers used compromised websites to store malicious files.
     - Used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet.
     - Built files on the host from base64.
     - Created public registry accounts to trick developers into pulling and running malicious container images.
     - Conducted a massive attack against GitHub, Docker Hub, Travis CI, and Circle CI.
   - **Execution:**
     - Abused command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands.
     - Used cron utility to schedule local jobs.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Used LD_PRELOAD to hijack execution flow.
     - Created new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Used hostPath mount to gain persistence on the underlying host.
     - Used chroot to run processes outside the container.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Removed security software.
     - Used obfuscated files or information.
     - Executed fileless malware attacks.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Used open-source tools to collect credentials.
     - Created and hid users in the victim's environment.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used proxy tools like Ngrok for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
     - Used legitimate external websites as C2 servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Automated exfiltration of AWS credentials.
   - **Impact:**
     - Cryptocurrency mining was the main objective.
     - New objectives include backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that adversaries will detect compromised Docker APIs using tools like DOCKERGEDDON during reconnaissance before deploying malicious containers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report mentions that attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports exposed to the internet for initial access.
   - The report does not explicitly state that the attackers used tools like DOCKERGEDDON for reconnaissance.
   - However, the report does mention that attackers used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities, which could include tools like DOCKERGEDDON.
   - The use of such tools for reconnaissance is a common practice in the cybersecurity field to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that attackers used open-source and offensive security tools to find vulnerabilities.
   - DOCKERGEDDON is a well-known tool used to scan and exploit Docker APIs.
   - Given that the attackers exploited misconfigured Docker API ports, it is reasonable to infer that they might have used tools like DOCKERGEDDON to identify these vulnerabilities during the reconnaissance phase.
   - The report does not explicitly rule out the use of such tools, and the use of such tools aligns with the described attack methodology.
