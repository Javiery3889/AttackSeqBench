### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a Spearphishing Attachment (T1193) via a well-crafted email containing a malicious Excel document.
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882, leading to silent code execution (T1204 - User Execution).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, used T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry) to collect credentials.
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005 - Data from Local System).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002 - Data Encrypted).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the stolen credentials will be sent to a command and control (C2) server using standard application layer protocols before encrypting the data for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Sequence in the CTI Report:**
     - The report states that the data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002 - Data Encrypted).
     - There is no mention of the data being sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
   - **Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes** - This would imply that the data is sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
     - **B: No** - This would imply that the data is not sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption, which aligns with the report's statement that the data was encrypted before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the data was encrypted before exfiltration (T1002 - Data Encrypted).
   - There is no indication in the report that the data was sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols before encryption.
   - Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs is that the data was encrypted before being exfiltrated, without being sent to a C2 server using standard application layer protocols beforehand.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
