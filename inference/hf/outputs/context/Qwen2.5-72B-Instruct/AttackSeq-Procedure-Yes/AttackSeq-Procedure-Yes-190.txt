### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** It persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` at `/system/bin/netd` and checks if `init` is the parent process.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes files containing credentials and uses `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** It enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Collection:** It collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** It provides SCP functionality, deploys a Tor hidden service, and provides a local Socks connection for SSH.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to automatically exfiltrate collected files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service followed by SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that Infamous Chisel collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** The report mentions that Infamous Chisel provides SCP functionality and deploys a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to an SSH program. It also provides a local Socks connection for SSH.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report does not explicitly state that the exfiltration happens at regular intervals, but it does mention the use of Tor and SSH for command and control, which implies the capability for exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware has the capability to collect files and use Tor and SSH for command and control.
   - The use of Tor and SSH for command and control suggests that the malware can exfiltrate data.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that exfiltration happens at regular intervals, the presence of these capabilities and the nature of the malware (which is designed to persist and maintain control) strongly suggests that exfiltration could occur at regular intervals.
