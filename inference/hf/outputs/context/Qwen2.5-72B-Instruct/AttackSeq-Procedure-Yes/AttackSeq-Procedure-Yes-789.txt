### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a password-protected RAR archive. When the archive is extracted, it reveals an executable file.
   - **Execution:** The executable file acts as a dropper, opening a document on the victim's desktop to reduce suspicion and then dropping and executing the backdoor 'C:\users\public\spools.exe'.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor sets the 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load' registry key to ensure it runs at user logon.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses 'stackstrings' obfuscation to hide its persistence and C&C communication mechanisms.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor, named BoxCaon, uses Dropbox as a C&C server. It creates a unique folder for the victim in the attacker-controlled Dropbox account, named after the victim's MAC address, and communicates using clear text commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor will access files on the Desktop as part of file and directory discovery before communicating with the C2 server using Dropbox and creating a unique folder named after the victim's MAC address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the backdoor sets the registry key to ensure persistence.
   - **File and Directory Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention that the backdoor accesses files on the Desktop as part of file and directory discovery. However, it does mention that the dropper opens the first document on the victim's desktop to reduce suspicion, which is a different action.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report states that the backdoor uses Dropbox for C&C communication and creates a unique folder named after the victim's MAC address.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide any evidence that the backdoor performs file and directory discovery on the Desktop before establishing C2 communication. The action of opening a document on the desktop is a tactic to reduce suspicion during the initial execution phase, not a part of file and directory discovery.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report is:
     1. Initial Access (spear-phishing email)
     2. Execution (dropper opens a document and drops the backdoor)
     3. Persistence (sets registry key)
     4. C2 Communication (uses Dropbox for C&C)
   - There is no mention of file and directory discovery on the Desktop before C2 communication.
