### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
     - Initial shellcode stage located and executed a secondary shellcode stub.
     - Secondary shellcode stub decrypted and executed an embedded payload.
     - Payload created a temporary file in the %TEMP% folder and executed it using WinExec.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll.
     - hccutils.dll performed security product checks and initiated the next stage of execution.
     - Used three techniques for persistence, including setting registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Modified registry keys to ensure malicious DLLs run after reboot or load with every user mode process.
     - Injected ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistent execution.
   - **Collection:**
     - Captured data about the infected system and stole files from removable media.
     - Targeted Skype users, capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and communications.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
     - Supported proxy usage for victims behind web proxies.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.
     - Compressed, encrypted, and stored data in specific directories or sent to the C2 server.
   - **Others:**
     - Observed in targeted attacks against organizations in the United States.
     - Part of the T5000 malware family.
     - Known for extensive evasion techniques.
     - Author took significant measures to avoid detection and analysis by the security community.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to perform sandbox evasion by designing its multi-stage installation process to avoid detection from security researchers and analysis environments.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting a DLL into explorer.exe.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - The report mentions that T9000 is known for extensive evasion techniques.
     - The author took significant measures to avoid detection and analysis by the security community.
   - **Multi-Stage Installation:**
     - The initial access and execution stages involved a multi-stage process with shellcode and payload execution.
     - This multi-stage process can be designed to avoid detection in sandbox environments.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**
     - T9000 uses multiple methods to ensure persistence, including registry key modifications and DLL injection.
   - **Evasion Techniques:**
     - The report explicitly states that T9000 is known for extensive evasion techniques.
     - The author's efforts to avoid detection and analysis by the security community suggest a high level of sophistication.
   - **Multi-Stage Process:**
     - The multi-stage installation process, involving shellcode and payload execution, can be designed to evade sandbox detection.
     - Security researchers often use sandbox environments to analyze malware, and a sophisticated malware like T9000 would likely include mechanisms to avoid such detection.
