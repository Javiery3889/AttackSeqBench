### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, used techniques T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry) to steal stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005).
   - **Command and Control:** The stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using common ports and standard application layer protocols (T1043 and T1071).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and before stealing stored passwords and access tokens.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation and Execution:** The report clearly states that the Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204).
   - **Credential Access:** The next step in the attack sequence is the use of techniques T1003, T1081, and T1214 to steal stored passwords and access tokens.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of T1107 (File Deletion) as part of the attack sequence. However, T1107 is a common technique used by threat actors to remove traces of their activities to evade detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Plausibility of T1107:** While the report does not explicitly state the use of T1107, it is a plausible technique that could be employed by the threat actor to cover their tracks. This is especially true given the sophisticated nature of the attack, which includes multiple stages of credential access and data exfiltration.
   - **Contextual Information:** The threat actor, SWEED, is known to target precision engineering companies and has similarities to previous campaigns. This suggests a level of sophistication and a focus on evading detection, which aligns with the use of T1107.

### Final Answer
Given the sophisticated nature of the attack and the common use of T1107 in similar campaigns, it is likely that the campaign will employ T1107 (File Deletion) as part of defense evasion.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
