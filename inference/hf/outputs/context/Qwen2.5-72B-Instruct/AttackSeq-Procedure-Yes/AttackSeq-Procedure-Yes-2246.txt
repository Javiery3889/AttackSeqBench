### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** SideCopy uses decoys and honeytraps to target military personnel in India, often using LNK files and decoy documents.
   - **Resource Development:** They mimic Sidewinder APT's infection chains and focus on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based droppers, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** They deploy RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** They use various techniques like malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, and registry keys.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use decoy documents, cloned websites, and target Kavach to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** They use themes to target military personnel and honeytraps.
   - **Collection:** They use modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** They use fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts, targeting specific geographies.
   - **Exfiltration:** They target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if SideCopy is likely to target Kavach and use GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases during the credential access tactic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that SideCopy uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report explicitly states that SideCopy targets Kavach and uses GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - **Credential Access Tactic:** The report indicates that SideCopy's central motive is credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The collection phase involves using modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - The exfiltration phase involves targeting Kavach and using GoLang-based file recon plugins to exfiltrate Kavach authentication databases.
   - The credential access tactic is a logical step between collection and exfiltration, where the collected credentials are specifically targeted and exfiltrated.
   - Given that the report emphasizes the focus on Kavach and the use of GoLang-based file recon plugins, it is highly likely that these activities occur during the credential access tactic.
