### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Machete campaign used spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** A downloader was used to install backdoor components, which opened a decoy file and then ran the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks were created to ensure persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques were used, including obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware scanned for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrated stored credentials.
   - **Collection:** Data was collected by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers was done using FTP and HTTP, with fallback channels.
   - **Exfiltration:** Collected data was encrypted and exfiltrated to remote servers, with scheduled transfers every 10 minutes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Machete malware will list all nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command before copying files from local systems and removable media for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report clearly states that the initial access was gained through spearphishing emails with malicious compressed files, and the execution involved a downloader that installed backdoor components.
   - **Collection:** The report specifies that Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, copying files from local systems and removable media, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Wi-Fi Network Listing:** The report does not mention any activity related to listing nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command. The focus of the collection activities was on local and removable media, clipboard contents, keystrokes, and screenshots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the Machete malware's activities, and listing nearby Wi-Fi networks using the `netsh` command is not mentioned as part of its collection or any other phase.
   - The collection activities described in the report are focused on local and removable media, clipboard contents, keystrokes, and screenshots, which are directly relevant to the data exfiltration goals of the malware.
   - There is no indication that the malware performs network reconnaissance or lists nearby Wi-Fi networks as part of its standard operation.
