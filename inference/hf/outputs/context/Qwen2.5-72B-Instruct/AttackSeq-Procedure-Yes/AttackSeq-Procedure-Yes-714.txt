### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into the memory of Word.
     - The Sharpshooter downloader retrieved the second-stage implant, Rising Sun, from a control server.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant downloaded the second-stage binary to the startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Rising Sun implant performed reconnaissance by fetching various system and network information.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests with encrypted and obfuscated data.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data was encrypted and obfuscated before being exfiltrated to the control server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant is likely to download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Sharpshooter downloader is injected into the memory of Word via a malicious macro.
     - The Sharpshooter downloader retrieves the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant downloads the second-stage binary to the startup folder to ensure persistence.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The implant communicates with control servers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data is exfiltrated to the control server.

   From the report, it is clear that the Rising Sun implant is designed to download a second-stage payload to ensure persistence and to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities. The report explicitly states that the Rising Sun implant "downloaded the second-stage binary to the startup folder during the download process."

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI report, the Rising Sun implant does download a second-stage payload during execution to act as a downloader for subsequent malicious activities.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
