### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack involved a supply chain compromise where the download servers of Avast were compromised.
     - A malicious version of CCleaner 5.33 was distributed, which included a multi-stage malware payload.
     - The 32-bit CCleaner binary was modified to execute malicious code before proceeding with normal operations.
     - The malicious version was signed with a valid certificate issued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware payload attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature.
     - The malicious DLL file, CBkdr.dll, was modified to avoid detection.
     - The DLLEntryPoint created an execution thread to return control to the loader, which called CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall and set up a ROP chain.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware established a C2 channel by encrypting and encoding system information using modified Base64.
     - The communications were transmitted via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded IP address.
     - The malware stored the C2 IP address and the current system time plus two days in the registry.
   - **Impact:**
     - The attack could have a severe impact due to the high number of systems potentially affected.
     - Affected systems needed to be restored to a state before August 15, 2017, or reinstalled.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CCleaner binary will execute malicious code by calling `CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)` and initiating decryption of the malicious payload after being downloaded as part of a compromised CCleaner 5.33 installation package signed with a valid digital certificate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that the CCleaner 5.33 binary was modified to execute malicious code before proceeding with normal operations.
     - The binary was signed with a valid digital certificate.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the malware payload attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature.
     - The DLLEntryPoint created an execution thread to return control to the loader, which called CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall and set up a ROP chain.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report details the C2 communication process, which involves encrypting and encoding system information and transmitting it via an HTTPS POST request.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the CCleaner 5.33 binary was modified to execute malicious code before proceeding with normal operations.
   - The binary was signed with a valid digital certificate, which aligns with the question's context.
   - The report also mentions the use of a function to call and execute the malicious payload, which is consistent with the question's reference to `CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C)`.
