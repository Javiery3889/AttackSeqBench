### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious delivery documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
- Payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded from the internet.
- A Java downloader is used in some cases.

**Execution:**
- Macros enable the payload execution.
- Two files are created in the ProgramData directory.
- A VBS script executes a PowerShell script.
- The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
- The PowerShell script is obfuscated and divided into three parts: global variables, encryption functions, and the backdoor function.

**Persistence:**
- The VBS script path is added to the task scheduler.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Obfuscation techniques are used.
- Publicly available code is used to bypass AppLocker.

**Discovery:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Collection:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.

**Others:**
- Attackers monitor C&C server connections.
- False flags and error messages in simplified Mandarin Chinese are embedded in the PowerShell script.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After employing a backdoor function to collect machine information and take screenshots during the Discovery and Collection tactics, is it likely that the backdoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted channel during the Command and Control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
- The PowerShell script is obfuscated and divided into three parts, including encryption functions.
- The backdoor function sends collected data to a C&C server.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that the PowerShell script includes encryption functions, which suggests that the communication with the C&C server might be encrypted.
- The use of encryption is a common technique to evade detection and ensure the confidentiality of the data being exfiltrated.
- The attackers are monitoring the C&C server connections, which implies they are taking steps to protect their communication channels.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
2. The PowerShell script includes encryption functions, indicating that the data might be encrypted before being sent.
3. The attackers are monitoring the C&C server connections, suggesting they are taking measures to protect their communication.
4. Encryption is a common technique used in advanced malware to evade detection and ensure data confidentiality.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
