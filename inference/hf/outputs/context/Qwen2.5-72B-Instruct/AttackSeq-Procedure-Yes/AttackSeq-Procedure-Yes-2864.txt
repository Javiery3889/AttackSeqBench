### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack involved a supply chain compromise where the download servers of Avast were compromised to distribute a malicious version of CCleaner.
     - The malicious version, CCleaner 5.33, was signed with a valid certificate and hosted on the official download server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The 32-bit CCleaner binary was modified to execute malicious code before normal operations.
     - The malicious code decrypted a multi-stage payload, including a PE loader and a DLL file.
     - The PE loader was used to execute the DLL file, and memory regions were erased to evade detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware used techniques like zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature to evade detection.
     - The DLL file, CBkdr.dll, was modified to avoid detection, and a ROP chain was used to deallocate memory and exit the thread.
   - **Impact:**
     - The attack had a significant impact due to the high number of CCleaner downloads.
     - Systems needed to be restored or reinstalled, and users were advised to update to the latest version.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests after modifying the CCleaner binary and decrypting the multi-stage payload.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the malware modified the CCleaner binary to execute malicious code and decrypt a multi-stage payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware used various techniques to evade detection, including zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of HTTPS POST requests for C2 communication, it is a common technique used by malware to communicate with C2 servers.
     - The report mentions that the malware used a ROP chain to deallocate memory and exit the thread, which suggests sophisticated behavior that could include C2 communication.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The high level of sophistication and the use of multiple evasion techniques suggest that the malware is likely to use advanced communication methods, such as encrypted and encoded HTTPS POST requests, to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the malware and the common use of HTTPS POST requests for C2 communication in advanced malware, it is likely that the malware would establish a C2 channel using encrypted and encoded system information sent via HTTPS POST requests.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
