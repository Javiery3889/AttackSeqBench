### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to collect system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types during the Discovery phase after dumping credentials using a custom version of Mimikatz.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the Discovery phase. However, it is a common tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework for threat actors to gather system information to understand the environment better before proceeding with further actions.
   - **Credential Access:** The report clearly states that FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that FamousSparrow read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Logical Sequence:** After gaining credentials, it is logical for the threat actor to perform Discovery to understand the environment and identify valuable data before collecting and exfiltrating it.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access:** FamousSparrow used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Although not explicitly mentioned, it is a common and logical next step to gather system information to understand the environment.
   - **Collection:** After Discovery, the threat actor would read file contents.
   - **Exfiltration:** Finally, the data is exfiltrated to the C&C server.
