### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** BlueBravo uses compromised infrastructure, third-party services, and legitimate internet services (LIS) like Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox for C2 and to evade detection.
   - **Initial Access:** Malware is delivered through spearphishing emails with malicious links, leading to compromised websites that use scripts or HTML smuggling to load malware.
   - **Execution:** Malware acts as loaders with basic C2 functionality and employs anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Persistence:** Malware is copied to a directory and registry run keys are created for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques are used, including obfuscation, dynamic API resolution, masquerading, and DLL hijacking.
   - **Discovery:** Malware gathers system information such as username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and running processes.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gathering system information, BlueBravo is likely to use HTTPS for C2 communication and Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report mentions that BlueBravo uses third-party services and legitimate internet services (LIS) for C2.
     - HTTPS is a common protocol for C2 communication due to its encryption and ability to blend in with normal web traffic.
   - **Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox:**
     - The report specifically mentions the use of Dropbox for C2 and evasion.
     - While Microsoft OneDrive is not explicitly mentioned, the use of legitimate internet services (LIS) suggests that other cloud storage services like OneDrive could also be used.
   - **Bidirectional Communication:**
     - The report indicates that BlueBravo uses these services for C2, which implies bidirectional communication (sending commands and receiving data).

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given that BlueBravo uses legitimate internet services for C2 and evasion, and that HTTPS is a common protocol for secure communication, it is plausible that they would use HTTPS for C2.
   - The report explicitly mentions Dropbox, and the use of other cloud storage services like OneDrive is consistent with their tactics.
   - Therefore, it is likely that BlueBravo would use HTTPS for C2 communication and Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox for bidirectional communication.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
