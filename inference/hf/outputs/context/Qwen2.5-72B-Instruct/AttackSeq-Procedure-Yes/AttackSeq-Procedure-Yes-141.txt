### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers exploit a Ghostscript vulnerability (CVE-2017-8291) through malicious HWP files.
- These files are distributed by impersonating government institutions or organizations.
- The attacks target public sectors and cryptocurrency-related organizations.
- There has been an increase in activity due to the COVID-19 situation, particularly in April 2020.

**Collection:**
- The report includes a collection of malicious HWP file samples from January to May 2020.
- These files target specific professions or groups.
- The files often impersonate government inquiries or job-related documents.

**Others:**
- AhnLab's V3 product detects and blocks HWP malware using various aliases.
- The report suggests the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms.
- Continuous analysis and assessment are emphasized.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that after exploiting the Ghostscript vulnerability through malicious HWP files for initial access, the attackers will shift their attack methods by using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups with impersonated documents for collection.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through the exploitation of the Ghostscript vulnerability using malicious HWP files.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report mentions the possibility of further changes in malicious EPS file forms, which could imply a shift in attack methods.
- However, it does not explicitly state that the attackers will use simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion.

**Collection:**
- The report indicates that the attackers target specific professions or groups with impersonated documents.
- This is consistent with the collection phase of the attack.

**Sequence Analysis:**
- The report does not provide a clear sequence indicating that the attackers will shift to using simplified PostScript syntax in malicious EPS files for defense evasion before targeting specific professions or groups.
- The focus is on the initial access through HWP files and the collection of data from specific targets.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report primarily focuses on the initial access through HWP files and the collection of data from specific targets.
- While the report suggests the possibility of changes in malicious EPS file forms, it does not explicitly state that the attackers will use simplified PostScript syntax for defense evasion.
- The sequence of TTPs described in the question (initial access through HWP files, then defense evasion using simplified PostScript syntax, and finally targeting specific professions or groups) is not fully supported by the report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
