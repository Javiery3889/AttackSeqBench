### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Command and Control (C&C):** The report explicitly states that the Elderwood Project attackers have established C&C servers to control compromised systems. The domains identified include qwby.gownsman.com, wwwcnas.org, and gate-usa.com. These servers are used to retrieve commands from the attackers and maintain control over the victim's computer.
- **Others:** The report provides additional context about the Elderwood Project, including their history of targeting various industries, use of zero-day exploits, and their systematic approach. It also mentions their high level of technical capability and the backing they might have.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:** After deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks, is it likely that the Elderwood Project attackers will establish command and control (C&C) servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands from the attackers?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access via Zero-Day Exploits and Watering Hole Attacks:** The report mentions that the Elderwood Project attackers use zero-day exploits and have been linked to the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse attack on Google in 2009, which is a known method for gaining initial access.
- **Establishing C&C Servers:** The report explicitly states that the attackers have established C&C servers to control compromised systems and retrieve commands. This is a critical part of their attack methodology.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report clearly indicates that the Elderwood Project attackers use zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
  - The report also explicitly states that they establish C&C servers to maintain control over compromised systems and retrieve commands.
  - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (deploying zero-day exploits to gain initial access via watering hole attacks, followed by establishing C&C servers) aligns perfectly with the information provided in the report.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
