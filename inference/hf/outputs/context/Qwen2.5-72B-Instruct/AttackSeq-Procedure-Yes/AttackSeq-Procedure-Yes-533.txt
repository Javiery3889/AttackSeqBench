### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack leveraged a zero-day exploit, CVE-2019-13720, in Google Chrome.
- The exploit was delivered through a waterhole-style injection on a Korean-language news portal.
- A malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the main page to redirect victims to the exploit landing page.
- The script checked the victim's system for compatibility, targeting 64-bit Windows systems and Chrome versions 65 or newer.

**Persistence:**
- The malware installed tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
- The final payload was downloaded as an encrypted binary (worst.jpg), decrypted by the shellcode, and dropped as updata.exe to disk.

**Command and Control:**
- The main module of the malware, msdisp64.exe, downloaded the next stage from a hardcoded C2 server.
- The next stages were located in folders with the victim computer names on the C2 server.

**Others:**
- Technical details include the use of AJAX requests to download exploit code chunks, RC4 for decryption, and the obfuscation of the browser exploit script.
- The report mentions the use of BigInt for 64-bit arithmetic in JavaScript and the presence of debugging code left in the production code.
- MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the files involved and domain names used by the attackers are provided.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before attackers utilized heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload, is it likely that malicious JavaScript code was inserted into a Korean-language news portal to redirect victims to an exploit landing page, exploiting CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malicious JavaScript code inserted into a Korean-language news portal.
   - Redirects victims to an exploit landing page.
   - Exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
2. **Persistence:**
   - Installs tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler.
   - Downloads and decrypts the final payload.
3. **Command and Control:**
   - Downloads the next stage from a C2 server.

**Question Sequence:**
- Malicious JavaScript code inserted into a Korean-language news portal.
- Redirects victims to an exploit landing page.
- Exploits CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
- Utilizes heap spraying techniques to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive and execute embedded shellcode payload.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the attack began with the insertion of malicious JavaScript code into a Korean-language news portal, which redirected victims to an exploit landing page.
- The exploit landing page then leveraged CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.
- The report does not explicitly mention heap spraying techniques, but it is a common method used in browser exploits to gain arbitrary read/write primitives and execute shellcode.

Given the sequence described in the CTI report and the common techniques used in such attacks, it is highly likely that the malicious JavaScript code was inserted into the news portal to redirect victims to the exploit landing page, which then exploited CVE-2019-13720 in Google Chrome.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
