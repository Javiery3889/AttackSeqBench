### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks.
     - February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day to a number of unsuspecting targets.
   - **Persistence:**
     - February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - May 2015: Attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks.
     - 2015: A number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromise a number of Japanese companies involved in power generation, oil and natural gas, construction, finance, and transportation.
   - **Others:**
     - March to August 2013: Attack activity greatly subsides, although several new domains that will be used later are registered.
     - October 2011: Attack group attempts to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis by phishing the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi's death, targeting US defense targets.
     - June 2012: Attack campaign leverages previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day.
     - July & October 2015: Two new waves of attacks are launched, targeting multiple Japanese companies including a Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility and a major Japanese oil and gas company. The most likely goals are reconnaissance and long-term espionage.
     - 2016: SPEAR believes that attacks of this nature into companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and likely to continue to escalate in the future.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack group gathered user credentials for Yahoo and Windows Live through phishing domains after gaining initial access via an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability and before deploying a second-stage implant to compromise the investment arm of a major Japanese automaker.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that the group leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability in July to August 2011 to gain initial access.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report also states that in July to August 2011, the group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through phishing domains.
   - **Second-Stage Implant:**
     - The report mentions that in 2015, a number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromised a number of Japanese companies involved in various sectors, including the investment arm of a major Japanese automaker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access via the unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability occurred in July to August 2011.
   - The credential access through phishing domains also occurred in July to August 2011.
   - The deployment of the second-stage implant to compromise the investment arm of a major Japanese automaker occurred in 2015.
   - Therefore, the sequence of events is:
     1. Initial Access (July to August 2011)
     2. Credential Access (July to August 2011)
     3. Deployment of Second-Stage Implant (2015)

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
