### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with a chain of zero-day exploits targeting the Chrome browser and Microsoft Windows.
- The exploit for remote code execution (RCE) in Chrome was not retrieved, but an elevation of privilege (EoP) exploit was analyzed.
- The EoP exploit was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- The attackers used two distinct vulnerabilities in the Windows OS kernel: CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956.
- CVE-2021-31955 is an information disclosure vulnerability in ntoskrnl.exe related to the SuperFetch feature.
- CVE-2021-31956 is a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs.sys.
- The exploit used CVE-2021-31955 to obtain kernel addresses and CVE-2021-31956 along with Windows Notification Facility (WNF) to create arbitrary memory read and write primitives.
- The "PreviousMode" technique was used to inject malware into the system process.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky products detected the attacks using the Behavioral Detection Engine and the Exploit Prevention component.
- The threat actor is referred to as PuzzleMaker.
- Malware modules are detected with the verdicts PDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic, PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic, and UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.
- The hashes for the executables involved in the attack are provided for %SYSTEM%\WmiPrvMon.exe and %SYSTEM%\wmimon.dll.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting a chain of Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and achieving privilege escalation using CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956, is it likely that the Stager module will notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a malware Dropper module to further the attack?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit a chain of zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome and Windows to gain initial access.
2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Use CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 to achieve privilege escalation.
3. **Malware Injection:**
   - Use the "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process.

**Stager and Dropper Modules:**
- A Stager module is typically used to notify of successful exploitation and to download and execute a Dropper module.
- The Dropper module is responsible for delivering the final payload.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of a Stager module or the sequence of notifying of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a Dropper module.
- However, it is common in advanced attacks for a Stager module to notify of successful exploitation before proceeding to download and execute a Dropper module to ensure that the attack is successful and to avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The attack sequence described in the CTI report involves gaining initial access and achieving privilege escalation.
2. The report mentions the use of a "PreviousMode" technique to inject malware into the system process, which suggests a structured and multi-step attack.
3. In advanced attacks, it is common for a Stager module to notify of successful exploitation before downloading and executing a Dropper module to ensure the attack's success and to avoid detection.
4. While the report does not explicitly state the use of a Stager module, the nature of the attack and the techniques used suggest that such a module is likely to be part of the attack sequence.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
