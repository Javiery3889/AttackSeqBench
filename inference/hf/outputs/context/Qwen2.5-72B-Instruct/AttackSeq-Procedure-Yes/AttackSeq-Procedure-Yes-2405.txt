### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with a victim being enticed to follow a link to a file hosted on a cloud provider. The file contains trojanized files disguised as typical business interactions.
   - **Execution:** The EVILNUM malware, when executed, downloads a compressed folder with trojanized files that masquerade as PDFs and JPEGs. These files display decoy images while running a script in the background.
   - **Persistence:** The malware ensures persistence through reboots by adding a registry key, which is modified based on the antivirus product detected.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses techniques like timestomping, modifying registry keys, and using hidden windows to evade detection. It also removes artifacts of its presence and uses a one-way communication method to obtain the C2 address.
   - **Credential Access:** The agent can steal web session cookies.
   - **Collection:** The agent collects data from the local system and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The agent communicates with a C2 server by sending a GET request to check.php and registers with the C2 to obtain a unique identifier. It periodically checks web pages for one-way communications containing the C2 node address and receives tasks from the C2.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the EVILNUM agent is likely to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel by uploading harvested cookies and downloading files from the C2 after staging collected data and communicating with the C2 server to register and receive tasks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:** The report states that the agent collects data from the local system and stages it for exfiltration. This indicates that the agent is designed to gather and prepare data for transfer.
   - **Command and Control:** The agent communicates with the C2 server to register and receive tasks. The C2 server can send tasks to the agent, which may include instructions to exfiltrate data.
   - **Credential Access:** The agent has the capability to steal web session cookies, which are a form of data that can be exfiltrated.
   - **Exfiltration Mechanism:** The report mentions that the agent can upload and download files, which aligns with the capability to exfiltrate data over the C2 channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The agent collects and stages data for exfiltration.
   - The agent communicates with the C2 server to register and receive tasks.
   - The C2 server can send tasks to the agent, which may include instructions to exfiltrate data.
   - The agent has the capability to steal web session cookies and upload files, which are forms of data exfiltration.
   - Given the agent's capabilities and the nature of the C2 communication, it is highly likely that the agent will exfiltrate data over the C2 channel by uploading harvested cookies and downloading files from the C2.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
