### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with social engineering tactics, luring victims into opening malicious email attachments or downloading reports.
   - **Execution:** The malicious documents contained embedded macros that, when enabled, downloaded and executed the Pierogi backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Pierogi backdoor achieved persistence by adding a shortcut to the startup folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor checked for antivirus and security products and used techniques like file deletion and software packing to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor collected information about the infected machine, including computer name, username, GUID, antivirus name, and operating system version.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor could take screenshots and execute arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration was performed through web services, with the backdoor uploading screenshots to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Pierogi backdoor is likely to communicate with C2 servers using predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands after conducting discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the backdoor collects information about the infected machine, including computer name, username, GUID, antivirus name, and operating system version.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the backdoor uploads screenshots to the C2 server, indicating that it communicates with C2 servers.
   - **Communication:** While the report does not explicitly state that the backdoor uses predefined URLs for communication, it is a common practice for backdoors to use predefined URLs or domains to communicate with C2 servers. Given the backdoor's capabilities and the nature of C2 communication, it is reasonable to infer that the backdoor uses predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor collects system information as part of its discovery activities.
   - The backdoor exfiltrates data, including screenshots, to the C2 server.
   - C2 communication typically involves predefined URLs or domains to ensure reliable and consistent communication.
   - Given the backdoor's capabilities and the nature of C2 communication, it is highly likely that the backdoor uses predefined URLs for sending machine information and receiving commands.
