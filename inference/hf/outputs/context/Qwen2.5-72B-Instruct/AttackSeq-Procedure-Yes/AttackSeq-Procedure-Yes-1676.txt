### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial compromise via SocGholish, delivered through compromised websites.
     - Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript.
   - **Execution:**
     - Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader.
     - The loader contained a .NET injector (Donut) to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - PsExec was used to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and log file manipulation.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group.
     - Using Get-NetComputer from PowerView to search for computer objects in Active Directory.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:**
     - Deployment of WastedLocker ransomware to encrypt computers and servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers before communicating with a C&C domain via the injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report mentions that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group to profile the computer.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report indicates that the attackers used wmic.exe to execute commands on remote computers, which is a form of lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report states that the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a C&C domain.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly shows that the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for various activities, including command execution, process injection, and file upload/download.
   - The use of wmic.exe for executing commands on remote computers is a form of lateral movement.
   - The Cobalt Strike Beacon payload is used for communication with the C&C domain, which is a key part of the Command and Control phase.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement to execute commands and inject processes on remote computers before communicating with the C&C domain.
