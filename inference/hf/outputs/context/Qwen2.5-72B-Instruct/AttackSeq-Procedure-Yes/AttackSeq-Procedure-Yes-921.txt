### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
     - An exploitable vulnerability is located and used to inject a web shell code into the server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Explosive Trojan is deployed, consisting of a main executable binary and a DLL file.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Explosive can be installed with various service names and paths.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Trojan avoids detection by AV tools and merges into the system.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Keylogging capabilities are used to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Initially infected servers are used as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
     - New versions of the Explosive Trojan can infect connected USB devices.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - A multi-tiered server backend framework is used for control.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that the attack starts with a vulnerability scan and exploitation to gain initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
     - It also mentions that more recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it implies that the manual spread to the entire network happens before the USB infection feature is used.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is gained through a vulnerability scan and exploitation.
   - The attackers then use the infected server as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.
   - After gaining control over the network, the attackers may use the USB infection feature to further spread the malware.

### Final Answer
Based on the CTI report, it is likely that the attackers will use the infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network before employing the Explosive Trojan to achieve lateral movement by infecting connected USB devices.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
