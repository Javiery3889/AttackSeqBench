### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The threat actors behind the Emissary Trojan have shifted from using spear-phishing with attachments to also compromising legitimate websites to host their malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Emissary Trojan has been updated to evade detection through changes in configuration storage, command handling, and file size.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The Trojan communicates with C2 servers using HTTP requests and has three hardcoded C2s.
   - **Others:**
     - The Emissary Trojan has been in use since 2009, related to the Elise Trojan and Operation Lotus Blossom. It has evolved over the years, with increased development efforts after the publication of the Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015. The actors target military or government entities in Southeast Asia, primarily Taiwan and Hong Kong.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Emissary Trojan would compromise legitimate websites to host its malware for initial access before achieving persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service to run the exported function `ServiceMain`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report explicitly states that the threat actors have shifted to compromising legitimate websites to host their malware. This is a significant change in their tactics to increase the odds of successful infiltration.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The question mentions achieving persistence by writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service to run the exported function `ServiceMain`. While the report does not explicitly mention this specific persistence mechanism, it is a common tactic for malware to achieve persistence.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence of events described in the question aligns with the CTI report. The initial access method (compromising legitimate websites) is a plausible first step before the malware achieves persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the threat actors have adapted their tactics to include compromising legitimate websites for initial access.
   - This shift in tactics is aimed at increasing the likelihood of successful infiltration.
   - After gaining initial access, it is logical for the malware to then establish persistence to maintain control over the compromised system.
   - The specific persistence mechanism mentioned in the question (writing to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service) is a common and effective method for malware to ensure it remains active on the system.
