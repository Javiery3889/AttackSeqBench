### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attack involved the use of two malware families, PlugX and Elirks.
- **Elirks Malware**:
  - It is a basic backdoor Trojan discovered in 2010.
  - It is used to steal information from compromised systems.
  - Elirks retrieves its C2 address by accessing a predetermined microblog service or SNS.
  - Attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers on these platforms.
  - A sample from 2016 contained embedded URLs from a Japanese blog service.
  - Another sample from 2014 used a similar method, with the attacker's blog account still active.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: Is it likely that Elirks malware retrieved its command and control (C2) server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites after attackers created accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Details from the CTI Report**:
  - Elirks retrieves its C2 address by accessing a predetermined microblog service or SNS.
  - Attackers post encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers on these platforms.
  - This method was used in samples from 2016 and 2014.
- **Question Context**:
  - The question asks if it is likely that Elirks retrieves its C2 server address by accessing pre-determined microblog services or social networking sites after attackers created accounts on these platforms to post encoded IP addresses or domain names of the actual C2 servers.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **C2 Address Retrieval Method**:
   - The CTI report explicitly states that Elirks retrieves its C2 address by accessing a predetermined microblog service or SNS.
   - This method involves attackers posting encoded IP addresses or domain names of real C2 servers on these platforms.

2. **Historical Evidence**:
   - The report provides examples from 2016 and 2014 where Elirks used this method.
   - The attacker's blog account from 2014 was still active, indicating a consistent use of this technique.

3. **Consistency with the Question**:
   - The question aligns perfectly with the information provided in the CTI report.
   - The method described in the question matches the method used by Elirks as detailed in the report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
