### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The APT-TOCS attack used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
- A binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe".

**Execution:**
- The attack involved downloading Shellcode script functionalities and executing them in memory.
- Communication via Beacon mode, sending network heartbeat packages every 60 seconds.
- Data information was transmitted via the Cookie field.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attack ran in memory without writing to the hard disk.
- Multi-beacon communication was used to evade detection.
- The attack was designed to evade security software and firewall interception.

**Lateral Movement:**
- APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network as required.

**Others:**
- APT-TOCS is related to the Cobalt Strike platform.
- The attack can penetrate firewalls and is undetectable.
- It is capable of attacking various platforms and evading Trusted Computing, Cloud Detection, and Sandbox Detection.
- The threat has been active for 5 years and is considered an APT due to its targeted nature and anti-detection functions.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing features such as running in memory and multi-beacon communication for defense evasion, is it likely that APT-TOCS will use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control tactic stage?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Initial Access and Execution:**
  - PowerShell is used to execute Shellcode scripts.
  - Shellcode script functionalities are downloaded and executed in memory.
- **Defense Evasion:**
  - Running in memory and multi-beacon communication are used to evade detection.
- **Command and Control:**
  - Communication via Beacon mode, sending network heartbeat packages every 60 seconds.
  - Data information is transmitted via the Cookie field.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report indicates that PowerShell is used for initial access and execution.
  - The attack uses multi-beacon communication and runs in memory to evade detection.
  - The communication via Beacon mode and data transmission via the Cookie field suggest that the attack uses HTTP-based communication.
  - It is plausible that the attack would use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate via HTTP GET requests during the command and control stage.
- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the attack does not use PowerShell for downloading encrypted data scripts or HTTP GET requests for communication, which contradicts the information provided in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that PowerShell is used for initial access and execution.
- The attack uses multi-beacon communication and runs in memory to evade detection.
- The communication via Beacon mode and data transmission via the Cookie field suggest that the attack uses HTTP-based communication.
- Given the use of PowerShell and HTTP-based communication, it is highly likely that APT-TOCS will use PowerShell to download encrypted data scripts and communicate with compromised systems via HTTP GET requests during the command and control stage.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
