### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- A malspam campaign used a lure PDF with an embedded RTF file.
- The RTF file exploits CVE-2017-8579 and contains an embedded remote object (HTA file).
- The HTA file contains encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute a file.

**Execution:**
- The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file, leading to the installation of ComboJack malware.

**Persistence:**
- ComboJack copies itself to a location on the victim's system.
- It uses `attrib.exe` to set hidden and system attributes to itself.
- It sets a registry key to ensure persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- ComboJack uses `attrib.exe` to set hidden and system attributes to itself, hiding the file from the user and allowing it to execute with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Impact:**
- ComboJack alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses, attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that after ensuring persistence and hiding itself, ComboJack will enter an infinite loop to check clipboard contents for wallet information before replacing legitimate wallet addresses with a hardcoded wallet address and attempting to redirect funds to the attacker.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** ComboJack sets a registry key and uses `attrib.exe` to hide itself.
- **Impact:** ComboJack alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses.

**Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
- **B: No**

**Reasoning:**
- The report clearly states that ComboJack alters clipboard contents to replace legitimate cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the attacker's wallet addresses.
- This implies that ComboJack must continuously monitor the clipboard to detect and replace wallet addresses.
- An infinite loop is a common method for continuously monitoring clipboard contents in malware.
- The report does not explicitly state that ComboJack enters an infinite loop, but the nature of the impact (continuously altering clipboard contents) strongly suggests this behavior.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the nature of the impact described in the CTI report, it is highly likely that ComboJack would use an infinite loop to continuously check and replace clipboard contents. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
