### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** UNC1945 exploited a vulnerability in an internet-exposed Solaris server's SSH service to install the SLAPSTICK backdoor.
   - **Execution:** UNC1945 used custom virtual machines and the LEMONSTICK backdoor for command execution and file transfer.
   - **Persistence:** UNC1945 established persistence using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** UNC1945 escalated privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and open source tools like Mimikatz. They also installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO.
   - **Credential Access:** UNC1945 collected credentials using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** UNC1945 used various tools for internal reconnaissance, including network scanners and a SPARC executable.
   - **Lateral Movement:** UNC1945 moved laterally using stolen credentials and tools like ProxyChains, PUPYRAT, IMPACKET with SMBEXEC, and RDP.
   - **Command and Control:** UNC1945 used SSH Port Forwarding and a custom QEMU Virtual Machine for direct access to the command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that UNC1945 escalated privileges using the SLAPSTICK backdoor and other tools before employing anti-forensics techniques such as executing the STEELCORGI ELF packer in memory for log obfuscation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report clearly states that UNC1945 used the SLAPSTICK backdoor and tools like Mimikatz to escalate privileges.
   - **Anti-Forensics Techniques:** The report does not mention the use of the STEELCORGI ELF packer or any other specific anti-forensics techniques. The focus is on the initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, and command and control.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by UNC1945, including the use of the SLAPSTICK backdoor for privilege escalation.
   - However, the report does not mention any anti-forensics techniques such as the STEELCORGI ELF packer.
   - Given the information provided, it is not possible to confirm that UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques like executing the STEELCORGI ELF packer in memory for log obfuscation.
