### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack started with the delivery of an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various VBScripts and batch files were executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Persistence:** 'stopedge.bat' scheduled 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' was present.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Scripts were heavily obfuscated, and 'stopedge.bat' managed file deletions to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** 'versioninfo.bat' collected information about the user's computer.
   - **Command and Control:** 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicated with the C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Konni APT Group will use 'versioninfo.bat' to discover information about the user's computer before exfiltrating the collected data using 'unactivate.vbs'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Collection:**
     - 'versioninfo.bat' is explicitly mentioned as a script that collects information about the user's computer.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - 'unactivate.vbs' is responsible for exfiltrating data through a POST request.
     - 'versioninfo.bat' uses 'unactivate.vbs' to exfiltrate the collected information.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report indicates that 'versioninfo.bat' collects information and then uses 'unactivate.vbs' to exfiltrate it. This suggests a clear sequence where information is collected first and then exfiltrated.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that 'versioninfo.bat' collects information about the user's computer.
   - The report also states that 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrates the collected information using 'unactivate.vbs'.
   - The sequence of events in the report aligns with the question's proposed sequence: collecting information first and then exfiltrating it.
