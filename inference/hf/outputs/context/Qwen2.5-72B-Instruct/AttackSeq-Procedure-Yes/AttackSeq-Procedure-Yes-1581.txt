### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - T9000 uses `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll`.
     - `hccutils.dll` performs security product checks and initiates the next stage of execution.
   - **Persistence:**
     - T9000 modifies registry keys (e.g., `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`) to ensure the malicious DLLs run after reboot or with every user mode process.
     - It injects the `ResN32.dll` library into the `explorer.exe` process for persistent execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - T9000 avoids 24 identified security products and uses a multi-stage installation process with checks to detect analysis.
   - **Collection:**
     - T9000 captures data about the infected system, steals files from removable media, and targets Skype users.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - T9000 communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - T9000 exfiltrates various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000 is likely to use `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll` for subsequent execution before achieving persistence by modifying registry keys or injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into `explorer.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The question mentions that T9000 gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 through an RTF file. This is not explicitly mentioned in the CTI report, but it is a common method for initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that T9000 uses `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report mentions that T9000 achieves persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into the `explorer.exe` process.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that the execution of the malware (sideloading the DLL) would occur before setting up persistence mechanisms.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T9000 gains initial access through an RTF file exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution:**
     - Once the initial access is gained, the malware uses `igfxtray.exe` to sideload the malicious DLL `hccutils.dll`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After the execution, the malware sets up persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting the `ResN32.dll` library into the `explorer.exe` process.
