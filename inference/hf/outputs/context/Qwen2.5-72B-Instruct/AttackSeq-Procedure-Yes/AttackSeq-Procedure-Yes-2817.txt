### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware was detected in an executable file disguised as a PDF document.
- The spyware was delivered via spearphishing emails targeting diplomats.
- The spyware was signed with a previously unseen valid digital certificate.

**Command and Control:**
- Several C&C servers were identified, with IP addresses listed.

**Others:**
- The spyware was compiled between September 2015 and October 2017.
- The samples were signed with six different certificates.
- The versioning and functionality of the spyware overlap with the leaked source code.
- The spyware was detected in fourteen countries.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the authors of Hacking Team's spyware used VMProtect for obfuscation to evade detection before establishing communication with the identified C&C servers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The spyware was delivered via spearphishing emails.
- The spyware was disguised as a PDF file.
- The spyware was signed with a valid digital certificate.
- The spyware established communication with C&C servers.

**Relevant Information for the Question:**
- The question specifically asks about the use of VMProtect for obfuscation.
- The CTI report does not mention the use of VMProtect or any other specific obfuscation tool.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that the authors used VMProtect for obfuscation.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the authors did not use VMProtect for obfuscation.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides detailed information about the initial access and C&C communication but does not mention any specific obfuscation techniques used by the authors.
- While obfuscation is a common technique used by malware authors to evade detection, the report does not provide any evidence to support the use of VMProtect specifically.
- The use of a valid digital certificate and the disguise as a PDF file are already strong techniques to evade detection, but they do not necessarily imply the use of VMProtect.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the lack of specific evidence in the CTI report regarding the use of VMProtect, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
