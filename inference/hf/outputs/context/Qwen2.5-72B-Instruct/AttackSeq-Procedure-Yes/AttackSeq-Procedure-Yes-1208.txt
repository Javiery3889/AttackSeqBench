### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Turla used a watering hole attack on Armenian websites.
     - Malicious JavaScript was inserted into compromised websites.
     - The JavaScript fingerprints the visitor's browser and potentially delivers a second-stage malicious JavaScript.
   - **Execution:**
     - A fake Adobe Flash update warning was used to trick users into downloading and installing malware.
     - The fake installer installs both Turla malware and a legitimate Adobe Flash program.
   - **Persistence:**
     - NetFlash and PyFlash establish persistence using Windows scheduled tasks.
     - NetFlash downloads its second stage malware from a hardcoded URL and sets up a scheduled task.
     - PyFlash persists by modifying the Windows task that regularly launches the malware.
   - **Discovery:**
     - PyFlash executes OS-related commands (systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, getmac, arp) to gather information about the machine.
     - The gathered information is sent to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The output of PyFlash surveillance and C&C commands is exfiltrated using the C&C protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether PyFlash is likely to communicate with its hardcoded C&C server using AES-128 encryption in CBC mode for sending exfiltrated data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report mentions that PyFlash gathers information and sends it to the C&C server, but it does not specify the encryption method used for communication.
   - The report does not provide any details about the encryption algorithm or mode used for exfiltration.
   - Given the sophistication of the Turla group, it is plausible that they use encryption for C&C communication to evade detection. However, the specific use of AES-128 in CBC mode is not mentioned in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms that PyFlash exfiltrates data to a C&C server.
   - The report does not provide specific details about the encryption method used.
   - While it is common for advanced threat actors to use encryption, the exact method (AES-128 in CBC mode) is not specified in the report.
   - Without explicit information about the encryption method, it is not possible to definitively state that AES-128 in CBC mode is used.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide specific information about the encryption method used by PyFlash for C&C communication. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm that AES-128 in CBC mode is used based on the given information.
