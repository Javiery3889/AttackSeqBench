### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware to establish a foothold and performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 achieves persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - **Collection:** APT10 identifies systems of interest and stages data for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to conduct internal reconnaissance to map out the network before leveraging shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 gains initial access through spear phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** After gaining access, APT10 deploys malware and performs internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 uses shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

   The CTI report clearly states that APT10 performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools after gaining initial access. This reconnaissance is a crucial step before the actor can effectively leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10 gains initial access through spear phishing emails.
   - Once the initial access is established, APT10 deploys malware and performs internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - After mapping the network, APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
