### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT Sidewinder exploited CVE-2017-11882 using an RTF document.
     - The RTF document downloaded an HTA file from the domain webserv-redir.net.
   - **Execution:**
     - The HTA file checked for installed antivirus software using WMI.
     - If no antivirus was detected, it proceeded to run a backdoor named FinalBot.exe.
     - FinalBot.exe was extracted from a zip file and renamed to Srvstr.exe.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and instead used VBS.
     - The backdoor used DLL sideloading with cmpbk32.dll to execute Srvstr.exe.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the HTA file will communicate with the C2 server and leverage webserv-redir.net for Command and Control after the described sequence of actions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report confirms that the RTF document downloaded an HTA file from webserv-redir.net.
   - **Execution:**
     - The HTA file checked for installed antivirus software using WMI.
     - If no antivirus was detected, it proceeded to run the FinalBot backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor established persistence by creating a Run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The HTA file avoided using PowerShell and used VBS.
     - The backdoor used DLL sideloading.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The HTA file used WMI to discover installed antivirus products.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The CTI report mentions that the HTA file communicated with the C2 server, which is consistent with the use of webserv-redir.net.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the HTA file communicated with the C2 server.
   - The domain webserv-redir.net is mentioned as the source of the HTA file and is likely used for Command and Control.
   - The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.
