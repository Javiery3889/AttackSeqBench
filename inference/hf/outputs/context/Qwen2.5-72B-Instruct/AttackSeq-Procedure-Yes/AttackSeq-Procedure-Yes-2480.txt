### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The adversaries sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx).
- They exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.

**Execution:**
- The adversaries exploited CVE-2021-40444 for client execution.
- They used PowerShell (Empire PowerShell stager) for the execution of the Empire stager.

**Persistence:**
- The adversaries established persistence by hijacking references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.
- They created a local account (net user /add user1) to maintain access to victim systems.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The adversaries used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.

**Command and Control:**
- The adversaries created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel.
- They used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.
- They employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers acquired infrastructure such as domains to serve as command and control servers during resource development.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access and Execution:**
  - The attack started with spear phishing emails and the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444.
  - This indicates that the initial access and execution were achieved through a known vulnerability and a malicious attachment.

- **Command and Control:**
  - The report explicitly states that the adversaries used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for command and control.
  - They also employed encryption to conceal the traffic.

- **Resource Development:**
  - The report does not mention the acquisition of new infrastructure such as domains for command and control.
  - Instead, it emphasizes the use of existing, legitimate services to obfuscate their activities.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly indicates that the attackers used existing, legitimate external web services (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for command and control.
- There is no mention of the attackers acquiring new infrastructure such as domains.
- Given the emphasis on using existing services and the lack of any indication of new infrastructure acquisition, it is unlikely that the attackers acquired new domains for command and control.

**Final Answer: B: No**
