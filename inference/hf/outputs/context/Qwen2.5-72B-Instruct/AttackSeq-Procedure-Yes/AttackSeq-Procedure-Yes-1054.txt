### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices. They have advanced reconnaissance capabilities.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and possess advanced mathematical and crypto-analytical capabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates and seeding P2P sharing sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy various malware components, including small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and a selective infector virus.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services using an information stealer module.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after gaining victim credentials using the information stealer module, the Darkhotel APT is likely to deploy their keylogger module for input capture and encrypt and store gathered data in log files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that the Darkhotel APT uses an information stealer module to target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that they use techniques to encrypt and store gathered data in log files.
   - **Keylogger Module:** The report also mentions that they deploy advanced keyloggers as part of their malware components.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT has a multi-stage attack process where they first gain credentials using the information stealer module.
   - After gaining credentials, it is logical for them to deploy additional modules to maximize the information they can gather.
   - The keylogger module is one of the malware components they use, and it is designed to capture input, which can include additional sensitive information.
   - The report also mentions that they encrypt and store gathered data in log files, which aligns with the keylogger's functionality.
