### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines and services in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files into archives and used the megacmd tool to upload them to cloud accounts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will collect data from local systems and network shared drives during the Collection phase before compressing this data using WinRAR for subsequent exfiltration via the megacmd tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines and services in the network.
   - **Collection Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention the Collection phase, but it is a logical step after Discovery. The goal of the Collection phase is to gather data from the compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report states that Earth Lusca compressed files into archives and used the megacmd tool to upload them to cloud accounts. This aligns with the question's description of compressing data using WinRAR (or similar tools) and exfiltrating it via megacmd.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to Collection:** After discovering machines and services, it is logical for the threat actor to collect data from these systems. This is a common sequence in cyber attacks.
   - **Collection to Exfiltration:** The report confirms that Earth Lusca compressed files and used megacmd for exfiltration. This aligns with the question's description of compressing data and exfiltrating it.
