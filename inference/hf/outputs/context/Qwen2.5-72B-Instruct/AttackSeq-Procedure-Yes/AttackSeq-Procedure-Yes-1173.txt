### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Persistence:**
- Upon gaining access to a system, the group likely drops further tooling and/or seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to the compromised systems in order to maintain persistent access.
- The actor is likely to use anonymizing services when using the stolen credentials.

**Command and Control:**
- APT29 deploys custom malware known as WellMess or WellMail to conduct further operations on the victim's system.
- WellMess is designed to execute arbitrary shell commands, upload and download files, and supports HTTP, TLS, and DNS communications methods.
- WellMail is a lightweight tool designed to run commands or scripts with the results being sent to a hardcoded Command and Control (C2) server.

**Others:**
- APT29 is part of the Russian intelligence services.
- The group targets governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare, and energy targets for intelligence gain.
- APT29 has targeted organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.
- The group uses custom malware known as 'WellMess' and 'WellMail'.
- SoreFang is a first stage downloader that uses HTTP to exfiltrate victim information and download second stage malware.
- APT29 is likely to continue targeting organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After APT29 uses publicly available exploits to gain a foothold for initial access, is it likely that the group will drop further tooling or obtain legitimate credentials on compromised systems to maintain persistence?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** APT29 uses publicly available exploits to gain a foothold.
2. **Persistence:**
   - Drops further tooling.
   - Seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.
3. **Command and Control:**
   - Deploys custom malware (WellMess or WellMail) to conduct further operations.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This aligns with the CTI report, which states that APT29 is likely to drop further tooling and/or seek to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.
- **B: No**
  - This does not align with the CTI report, as the report clearly indicates that APT29 takes steps to maintain persistence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report explicitly states that APT29, upon gaining access to a system, is likely to drop further tooling and/or seek to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.
2. The report also mentions the use of custom malware (WellMess and WellMail) for further operations, which supports the idea of maintaining persistence.
3. The group's behavior of using anonymizing services when using stolen credentials further reinforces the importance of maintaining persistent access.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
