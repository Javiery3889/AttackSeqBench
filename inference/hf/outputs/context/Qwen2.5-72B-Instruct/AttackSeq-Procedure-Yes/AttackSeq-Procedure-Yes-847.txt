### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for further access.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after the discovery phase, it is likely that attackers will exploit remote services to achieve lateral movement before installing additional persistence points on new systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the discovery phase involves exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the order of lateral movement and persistence installation, but it implies that lateral movement is a necessary step to spread across the network.
   - **Persistence:** The report emphasizes the importance of persistence points to ensure ongoing access to the network.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to Lateral Movement:** After discovering the network, attackers typically need to move laterally to access other systems. This is a logical next step to expand their control and reach their strategic goals.
   - **Lateral Movement to Persistence:** Once they have moved laterally, it is common for attackers to install additional persistence points on the new systems to ensure they can maintain access and continue their operations.
   - **Sequence:** The sequence of actions is likely to be: Discovery → Lateral Movement → Persistence. This aligns with the typical attack lifecycle where attackers first explore the network, then move to other systems, and finally ensure they can maintain access.
