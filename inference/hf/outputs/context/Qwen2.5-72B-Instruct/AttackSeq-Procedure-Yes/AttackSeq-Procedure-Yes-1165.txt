### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2014-4148 embedded in a Word document, to compromise targets.
   - **Discovery:** Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
   - **Collection:** The malware has extensive remote control capabilities and can be customized with additional plugins and modules for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** Longhorn configures specific domains and IP addresses for C2 servers, using privacy services and HTTPS with a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines to avoid detection before performing system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities with their espionage-focused malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that Longhorn uses zero-day exploits embedded in Word documents to gain initial access.
   - **Avoiding Detection:** The report mentions that Longhorn uses operational security measures, such as specific C2 configurations, privacy services, and custom cryptographic protocols to avoid detection.
   - **System Fingerprinting and Discovery:** The report states that Longhorn's malware is built for detailed system fingerprinting and discovery capabilities, which are essential for espionage operations.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Operational Security:** Longhorn places a high emphasis on operational security to avoid detection. This includes using specific C2 configurations, privacy services, and custom cryptographic protocols.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** After gaining initial access, it is logical for Longhorn to ensure that their operations remain undetected before performing system fingerprinting and discovery. This aligns with the operational security measures described in the report.
   - **Espionage Focus:** The malware is designed for espionage, which requires detailed system fingerprinting and discovery. However, these actions are performed after ensuring that the malware remains undetected to avoid alerting the target.
