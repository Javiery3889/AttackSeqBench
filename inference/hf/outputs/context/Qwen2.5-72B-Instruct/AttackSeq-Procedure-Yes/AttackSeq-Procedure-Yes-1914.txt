### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for long-term remote access.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to ensure malware remains active.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives, often placed in the Recycle Bin.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools like Robocopy and PSCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure for lateral movement to gain access to new areas of the network before staging exfiltration data in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that APT10 uses MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - **Collection:** The report states that APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives, often placed in the Recycle Bin, using compression tools.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After discovery, APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally within the network.
   - **Collection:** Once APT10 gains access to new areas of the network, it stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin using compression tools.
