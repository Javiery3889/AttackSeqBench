### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros.
- The macros executed an embedded JScript file when enabled.

**Execution:**
- The VBA macro decoded and ran, writing JScript data to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and executing it.
- A decoy XLS file was saved and loaded to maintain the appearance of legitimacy.
- A VBScript file was created to delete the original file.
- The network.js file modified the '%regrun%' registry to ensure autostart.

**Persistence:**
- Persistence was established by modifying the '%regrun%' registry entry to point to the network.js file.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware used base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file.
- The URL string in the JScript code was obfuscated in two layers: base64 encoding and a custom decryption routine.

**Discovery:**
- NanHaiShu gathered system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, Proxy Server) and uploaded it to the C&C server.

**Exfiltration:**
- The malware could receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for data exfiltration.
- The exfiltrated data was likely to be highly sensitive.

**Others:**
- The threat actor is believed to be of Chinese origin, targeting entities involved in the South China Sea dispute.
- The C&C servers pointed to a Chinese AS and coincided with news reports of US ship movements in the South China Sea.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After NanHaiShu gathers system information from the infected machine and uploads it to the C&C server, is it likely that the malware will communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers to upload encoded system information and switch from IP addresses hosted in the United States to a Chinese IP address?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware gathers and uploads system information to the C&C server.
- The C&C servers are associated with a Chinese AS.
- The threat actor is believed to be of Chinese origin.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report mentions that the C&C servers are associated with a Chinese AS, which suggests that the malware is likely to communicate with servers in China.
  - Dynamic DNS providers are often used to mask the true location of C&C servers and to make it harder for defenders to block or trace the communication.
  - The use of dynamic DNS and switching from US-based IP addresses to Chinese IP addresses aligns with the goal of evading detection and maintaining control over the infected machines.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not use dynamic DNS or switch IP addresses, which is less likely given the threat actor's sophistication and the need to maintain stealth and control.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the threat actor is of Chinese origin and the C&C servers are associated with a Chinese AS.
- The use of dynamic DNS and switching IP addresses is a common technique in advanced malware to evade detection and maintain persistence.
- Given the sophistication of the attack and the need to maintain control over the infected machines, it is highly likely that the malware would use dynamic DNS and switch IP addresses to Chinese servers.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
