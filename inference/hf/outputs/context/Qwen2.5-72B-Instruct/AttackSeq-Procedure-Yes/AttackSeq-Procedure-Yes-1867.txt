### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attack starts with a malicious Word document using the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure the malware persists on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - APT28 uses the DDE technique to bypass network defenses.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto the victim's system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT28 will use a Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) to download a file, create persistence through a batch file and registry entry, and then connect to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report confirms that the attack starts with a malicious Word document using the DDE technique to execute arbitrary code. This aligns with the use of a Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) to download a file.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report states that the document creates a batch file and a registry entry to ensure persistence. This matches the question's description of creating persistence through a batch file and registry entry.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report mentions that the document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader. This aligns with the question's description of connecting to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sequence described in the question matches the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report. Therefore, it is likely that APT28 will use a Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell) to download a file, create persistence through a batch file and registry entry, and then connect to a command and control server to drop the first-stage Seduploader malware.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
