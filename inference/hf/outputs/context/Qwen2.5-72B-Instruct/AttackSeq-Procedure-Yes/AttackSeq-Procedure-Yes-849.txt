### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code to gain control.
   - **Persistence:** Ensuring ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges to install malware or persistence points.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement after discovering systems, users, and data relevant to the mission but before collecting the relevant data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that exploration within the target network is required to locate systems, users, and data relevant to the mission.
   - **Lateral Movement:** While not explicitly mentioned in the report, lateral movement is a common tactic used by attackers to spread within the network.
   - **Persistence:** The report emphasizes the importance of persistence points to ensure ongoing access to the network. It is often a critical step to maintain control and ensure the attack can continue even if some systems are cleaned or defenses are strengthened.
   - **Collection:** After discovering the relevant systems and data, the next logical step is to collect the data.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After discovering the relevant systems, users, and data, attackers often want to ensure they can maintain access to these systems. This is where installing further persistence points becomes crucial.
   - Persistence points can be installed during lateral movement to ensure that the attackers can return to the discovered systems and data even if the initial access point is compromised or the initial persistence mechanisms are detected and removed.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that attackers will install further persistence points during lateral movement before proceeding to collect the relevant data.
