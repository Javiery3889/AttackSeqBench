### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** SideCopy APT group mimics Sidewinder APT's infection chains to deliver their own malware, focusing on espionage and credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India.
   - **Initial Access:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, self-extracting RAR-based dropper executables, and MSI-based installers.
   - **Execution:** Deploys RATs and plugins for file enumeration, credential stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Persistence:** Uses malicious LNK files, HTAs, loader DLLs, MSI-based installers, registry keys, and VBScripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses decoy documents, images, cloned websites, and targets Kavach to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Focuses on credential harvesting, targeting Kavach and using njRAT malware with special victim IDs.
   - **Discovery:** Uses themes targeting military personnel, honeytraps, and cloned legitimate websites.
   - **Collection:** Uses modular plugins for file enumeration, browser password stealing, and keylogging.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses fake or compromised websites to deliver malicious artifacts, verifying requests from specific geographies.
   - **Exfiltration:** Focuses on credential harvesting, targeting Kavach and using GoLang-based file recon plugins.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Themes and Targets:** The report mentions that SideCopy uses themes predominantly designed to target military personnel in the Indian subcontinent, with LNK files and decoy documents posing as internal, operational documents of the Indian Army. They also use honeytraps and cloned legitimate websites.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** The primary focus of SideCopy is credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, an MFA app used by the Government of India.
   - **Infection Chains:** SideCopy mimics the infection chains of Sidewinder APT to deliver their own malware, indicating a sophisticated and targeted approach.
   - **Espionage:** The report clearly states that SideCopy uses a variety of post-infection plugins specifically for espionage.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Targeting Military Personnel:** The use of themes and decoys targeting military personnel suggests a strategic approach to gather initial access and identity information.
   - **Credential Harvesting:** The focus on credential harvesting, particularly targeting Kavach, indicates a clear intent to gather victim identity information from government personnel.
   - **Mimicking Infection Chains:** The mimicry of Sidewinder APT's infection chains suggests a well-planned and sophisticated approach to developing their own malware for espionage.
   - **Espionage:** The use of post-infection plugins for espionage aligns with the overall goal of gathering sensitive information.

### Final Answer
Given the detailed focus on credential harvesting, the use of themes targeting military personnel, and the sophisticated mimicry of infection chains, it is highly likely that SideCopy APT will target government personnel in India to gather victim identity information before mimicking legitimate infection chains of Sidewinder APT to develop their own malware for espionage.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
