### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - LYCEUM gained initial access by using account credentials obtained through password spraying or brute-force attacks.
     - They sent spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware.
   - **Execution:**
     - LYCEUM executed the DanBot malware, which uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms.
     - They used additional tools like a PowerShell-based keylogger (kl.ps1), Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1, and Get-LAPSP.ps1.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - They used DanDrop, a VBA macro embedded in an Excel XLS file, to drop the DanBot malware.
     - They made incremental improvements to obfuscate the macro and refactor some of the functionality to evade defenses.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - They deployed tools such as Decrypt-RDCMan.ps1 and Get-LAPSP.ps1 to gather additional credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - They targeted HR and IT personnel with spearphishing emails to compromise accounts for further operations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that LYCEUM registered new domains suspected to be part of their command and control (C2) infrastructure after gaining initial access and executing DanBot malware using DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that LYCEUM gained initial access through password spraying or brute-force attacks and then executed DanBot malware.
     - DanBot uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms, which are typical for C2 communication.
   - **C2 Infrastructure:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state that LYCEUM registered new domains, it is a common practice for threat actors to register new domains for C2 infrastructure to maintain communication with compromised systems and to evade detection.
     - The use of DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms suggests that LYCEUM needed a reliable and possibly dynamic C2 infrastructure, which often involves registering new domains.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - Given the nature of the attack and the use of DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms, it is highly likely that LYCEUM registered new domains to support their C2 infrastructure.
   - The report's focus on the use of DanBot and its communication mechanisms strongly implies the need for a robust C2 infrastructure, which typically includes registering new domains.
