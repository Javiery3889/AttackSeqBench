### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Malicious shortcut files are sent as email attachments.
- These files, when opened, infect the host with Asruex malware.

**Execution:**
- Opening the malicious shortcut file triggers a PowerShell command.
- The PowerShell command downloads a batch file from a URL.
- The batch file then executes PowerShell scripts to download a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Asruex malware has anti-analysis features:
  - Detects virtual machines and stops running if detected.
  - Detects anti-virus software.
- Asruex downloads and executes AdvProv.dll, which expands its functions, including file manipulation and registry operations.

**Others:**
- Asruex is a relatively new malware observed since October 2015.
- The malware is likely to be used in continued targeted attacks.
- Hash values of artifacts and destination URLs are provided for security measures.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable and a decoy document during the execution phase, is it likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware during the command and control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Malicious shortcut file is opened.
2. **Execution:**
   - PowerShell command is executed.
   - Batch file is downloaded.
   - PowerShell scripts download a Windows executable (downloader) and a decoy document.
3. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Asruex malware has anti-analysis features.
   - Asruex downloads and executes AdvProv.dll.

**Command and Control Phase:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the command and control phase or the retrieval of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

**Evaluation:**
- The report focuses on the initial access, execution, and defense evasion phases.
- It does not provide specific details about the command and control phase or the retrieval of an image file.
- The downloader is mentioned, but there is no indication that it retrieves an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not provide any information about the command and control phase involving the retrieval of an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.
- The report focuses on the initial infection and execution phases, detailing the download of a Windows executable and a decoy document.
- Given the lack of information about the command and control phase and the specific retrieval of an image file, it is not likely that the downloader will retrieve an image file containing encoded Asruex malware.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
