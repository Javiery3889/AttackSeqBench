### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The OceanLotus Group targeted top-level management using spear-phishing attacks.
   - **Resource Development:** They developed a sophisticated arsenal, including custom tools and modified publicly-available tools.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial penetration vector was social engineering through spear-phishing emails with links to malicious sites or weaponized Word documents.
   - **Execution:** They used fileless PowerShell-based infrastructure and executed PowerShell scripts with embedded base64-encoded payloads.
   - **Persistence:** They established persistence using Windows registry, services, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and perform lateral movement.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They exploited DLL hijacking and implemented DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication.
   - **Credential Access:** They harvested credentials using Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** They performed lateral movement using stolen credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They expanded control within the network using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrated data using a backdoor macro in Microsoft Outlook.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the OceanLotus Group will perform lateral movement using stolen credentials and leveraging Windows built-in tools before establishing command-and-control communication through HTTP and DNS Tunneling.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the OceanLotus Group performed lateral movement using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools.
   - **Command-and-Control Communication:** The report mentions that they implemented DNS Tunneling as a command-and-control communication method to overcome network filtering solutions.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state the exact sequence of these actions, but it does provide a logical flow of events. Typically, after gaining initial access and establishing persistence, attackers would perform privilege escalation and lateral movement to expand their control within the network. Once they have a foothold and control over multiple machines, they would set up command-and-control communication to maintain control and exfiltrate data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Persistence:** The attackers gained initial access through spear-phishing and established persistence using various methods.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** They used Mimikatz to obtain credentials and performed lateral movement to infect more machines.
   - **Command-and-Control Communication:** They set up DNS Tunneling for command-and-control communication to maintain stealth and avoid detection.

Given the logical flow of the attack sequence described in the report, it is reasonable to infer that the OceanLotus Group would perform lateral movement using stolen credentials and Windows built-in tools before establishing command-and-control communication through DNS Tunneling.
