### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Watering hole tactics were used to compromise websites related to North Korea.
     - Exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 were injected into these websites.
     - The campaign avoided South Korean IP addresses, targeting the global Korean diaspora.
   - **Execution:**
     - Chrome exploit vector: Chained CVE-2019-5782 and an unnamed Chrome bug to execute custom shellcode, which de-obfuscated strings, initialized a network connection, and downloaded 'dropper.dll'.
     - 'dropper.dll' checked for security software and, if none were detected, downloaded and executed three additional malware samples.
     - Internet Explorer exploit vector: Used CVE-2020-0674 to run a PowerShell loader, which infected victims with the same three malware variants.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Checks for security software were implemented during malware deployment to avoid detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - SLUB malware variant communicated with a Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.
     - Created individual channels for each infected machine and used a notification channel for real-time updates.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - SLUB malware variant exfiltrated system information and captured screenshots to the Mattermost server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will execute commands to collect system information and capture screenshots from infected machines under the SLUB variant before exfiltrating this information to the Mattermost server, after implementing checks for security software during malware deployment to evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report states that the attackers implemented checks for security software during malware deployment to avoid detection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report also states that the SLUB malware variant exfiltrated a significant amount of system information and captured screenshots to the Mattermost server.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence of events in the report suggests that after evading detection by checking for security software, the malware proceeds to collect system information and capture screenshots, which are then exfiltrated to the Mattermost server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the attackers implemented checks for security software to avoid detection.
   - After ensuring that the system is not protected by security software, the malware proceeds to collect system information and capture screenshots.
   - This information is then exfiltrated to the Mattermost server, which is used as the C&C infrastructure.
