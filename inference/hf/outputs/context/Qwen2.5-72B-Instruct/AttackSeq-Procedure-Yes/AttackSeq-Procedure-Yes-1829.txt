### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps on Google Play. The apps Camero and FileCrypt Manager acted as droppers, downloading additional DEX files from a C&C server to install the callCam app.
   - **Execution:** The callCam app hides its icon and executes in the background to collect sensitive information.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** SideWinder used device rooting and accessibility permissions to install the payload app callCam.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper apps used overlay screens to hide the installation and launch of the payload app from the user. They also employed obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation.
   - **Collection:** The callCam app collected various types of data from the compromised devices.
   - **Command and Control:** The C&C server was used to communicate with the compromised devices and to download exploits and additional payload.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected data was encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, verified with SHA256, and exfiltrated to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the callCam app will collect files and screenshots from compromised devices before encrypting this data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms for exfiltration to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The CTI report explicitly states that the callCam app collected various types of data from the compromised devices.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also mentions that the collected data was encrypted using RSA and AES encryption algorithms and exfiltrated to the C&C server.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report confirms that the dropper apps used overlay screens to hide the installation and launch of the payload app from the user.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the callCam app collects data from the compromised devices.
   - The data collection is followed by encryption using RSA and AES algorithms.
   - The encrypted data is then exfiltrated to the C&C server.
   - The use of overlay screens to hide the installation and launch of the payload app aligns with the defense evasion techniques described in the report.
