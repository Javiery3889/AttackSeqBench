### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The actors used spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to deliver various tools and RATs.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The actors developed a significant toolset, including custom tools and off-the-shelf RATs.
     - They used the Andromeda Trojan as an initial payload to download and execute other tools.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Utilized WHOIS protection services to conceal their infrastructure.
     - Used various Trojans and RATs for defense evasion.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Command and control infrastructure included domains registered with WHOIS protection.
     - Used C2 servers for the Andromeda Trojan to deliver further payloads.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that ProjectM will execute malicious code using Trojans like Crimson and Peppy as well as RATs such as DarkComet and Bozok before employing techniques to evade defense measures such as WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the actors gained initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, delivering payloads via malicious RTF and Excel files exploiting known vulnerabilities.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - The report mentions the use of Trojans like Crimson and Peppy, as well as RATs like DarkComet and Bozok.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report indicates that the actors used WHOIS protection services to conceal their infrastructure, which is a technique for defense evasion.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report suggests that the initial access was followed by the execution of malicious code using Trojans and RATs.
     - The use of WHOIS protection for infrastructure is mentioned as a technique for defense evasion, but it is not explicitly stated that this happens after the execution of the malicious code.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through spear-phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - Once initial access is gained, the actors deliver and execute malicious code using Trojans and RATs.
   - The use of WHOIS protection for infrastructure is a general technique for defense evasion, but it is not necessarily a step that follows the execution of the malicious code in a strict sequence.
   - The report does not provide a strict chronological order for all these steps, but it is reasonable to infer that the execution of malicious code (using Trojans and RATs) would occur before or concurrently with the use of WHOIS protection for infrastructure.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
