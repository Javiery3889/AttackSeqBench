### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
- A zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Follows Vault 7 guidelines for avoiding detection.
- Practices include wipe-on-use, in-memory string de-obfuscation, unique deployment-time keys, and secure erase protocols.
- Malware communicates externally at select times with upload limits on exfiltrated data and randomization of communication intervals.

**Discovery:**
- Malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
- Uses operational security measures to remain undetected.

**Collection:**
- Malware has extensive remote control commands and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
- Designed for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers.
- Uses privacy services to hide real identity.
- Communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been protecting customers and tracking the group.
- Infiltrated governments, international organizations, and various sectors.
- Operates with high operational security, likely from an English-speaking, North American country.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After configuring a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C communication over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol, is it likely that Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Command and Control:**
  - Configures specific domain and IP address combinations.
  - Uses HTTPS and a custom cryptographic protocol.
- **Defense Evasion:**
  - Communicates externally at select times.
  - Uses upload limits on exfiltrated data.
  - Randomizes communication intervals.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomizes communication intervals to avoid detection.
- This aligns perfectly with the question's description of scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that Longhorn's malware employs techniques to avoid detection, including upload limits and randomized communication intervals.
- These techniques are consistent with the question's description of scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that Longhorn's malware will communicate externally for scheduled exfiltration to avoid detection through upload limits and randomized intervals.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
