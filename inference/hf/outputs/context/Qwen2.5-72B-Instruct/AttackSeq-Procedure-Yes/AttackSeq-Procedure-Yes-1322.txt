### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke uses social engineering and document-based exploits to trick victims into opening a malicious PDF or executable file. The exploit involves a malicious Flash object embedded in a PDF file that exploits the CVE-2011-0611 vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples to execute.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and installing a Windows service with the name 'javamtsup' and the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'
   - **Credential Access:** The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It also searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to search for files and target non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations before collecting information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that CosmicDuke achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task and installing a Windows service.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer. It also searches removable drives for files, but it specifically skips certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.' There is no mention of targeting non-English filenames specifically.
   - **Discovery Operations:** The report does not explicitly state that CosmicDuke targets non-English filenames as part of its discovery operations. The focus is on searching removable drives and collecting specific types of information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides detailed information about the malware's behavior, including its collection methods.
   - The collection methods include keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing, but there is no specific mention of targeting non-English filenames.
   - The search for files on removable drives is mentioned, but it is limited to avoiding certain file types and drives with specific volume names.
   - Given the lack of explicit information about targeting non-English filenames, it is not likely that this is a part of CosmicDuke's discovery operations.
