### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Functions used: `LoadLibraryA`, `CreateProcessA`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`, `LdrRegisterDllNotification`, `LdrUnregisterDllNotification`, `cmd.exe /C`, `powershell`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Functions used: `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, `DeleteKey`.
     - Registry key: `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Functions used: `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, `ZwClose`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS.
     - Strings: `Mozilla/5.0`, `Host:`, `http://`, `https://`, `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=%s`, `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="upload_file"; filename="%s"`.
   - **Others:**
     - Encoding and obfuscation techniques, GUIDs, file path manipulation, `runas`, `copy`, ActiveX objects, Internet Explorer settings.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that operators would use `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to discover process and thread information after employing registry queries for system information collection, before proceeding to command and control activities using HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Registry Queries:**
     - The CTI report mentions the use of `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` for system information collection, which aligns with the question.
   - **Process and Thread Information:**
     - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread`. However, it does mention several functions related to process and memory manipulation, such as `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, and `ZwClose`.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The CTI report clearly indicates the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs, including execution, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control activities.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread`, it does include several functions that are used for process and memory manipulation, which are related to discovering and manipulating process and thread information.
   - Given the context of the attack, it is plausible that the operators would use `ZwGetContextThread` and `ZwSetContextThread` to gather detailed information about processes and threads before proceeding to command and control activities.
