### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware like BLUEAGAVE and SIXPACK.
   - **Execution:** They use JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Persistence:** They use trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and email communications for command and control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** They use process memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** They use native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to transfer tools into the environment for Command and Control (C2) using techniques such as ingress tool transfer after using Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The report indicates that FIN13 uses various methods for C2, including email communications with a backdoor called MAILSLOT, and web shells for data exfiltration.
   - **Ingress Tool Transfer:** The report does not explicitly mention ingress tool transfer, but it does describe the use of custom tools and web shells for various stages of the attack, including initial access and execution.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that FIN13 uses custom tools and web shells for initial access and execution, it is plausible that they would also use similar techniques for C2. The use of web shells and custom tools suggests a capability to transfer and deploy tools as needed.
   - The report mentions the use of web shells and JSP tools for data exfiltration, which implies a need to transfer tools into the environment for C2 purposes.
   - The long dwell time and sophisticated nature of FIN13's operations suggest a high level of operational flexibility and adaptability, which would likely include the ability to transfer tools as needed.
