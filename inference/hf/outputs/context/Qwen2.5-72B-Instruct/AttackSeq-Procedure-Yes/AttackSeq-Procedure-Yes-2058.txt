### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The group used spear phishing and infections from other botnets.
- They also created their own large botnet using mass emailing.

**Execution:**
- Tools used: Mimikatz, MBR Eraser, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Cain & Abel, SSHD backdoor, Ammy Admin, Team Viewer, and Anunak malware.

**Persistence:**
- Gained access to ATM management infrastructure and infected systems with malicious software.
- Accessed email and workflow servers, server and banking system administrator workstations.
- Configured remote access to servers of interest, including firewall configuration changes.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used RDPdoor for remote access.
- Used MBR Eraser to remove traces and crack Windows computers and servers.
- Used legitimate programs like Ammy Admin and Team Viewer for remote access.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used Metasploit for port scanning, system reconnaissance, privilege escalation, credential gathering, and hopping onto other systems.
- Used VNC scanning and password brute forcing.
- Added additional administrator accounts.
- Used RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions.

**Command and Control:**
- Anunak malware connected to backends using PHP and a Windows server component.
- Used stealth methods like backconnect SSL and DNS tunneling.

**Impact:**
- Changed denominations of issued banknotes in the ATM operating system registry.
- Used a modified debug program to issue money from the ATM dispenser without opening the housing and vault door.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers used compromised domain administrator passwords to gain access to all active domain accounts before facilitating further lateral movement, such as adding additional administrator accounts or using RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used tools like Mimikatz to get passwords.
- They added additional administrator accounts.
- They used RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions.

**Relevant TTPs:**
- **Mimikatz** is a tool used to extract credentials, including domain administrator passwords.
- **Adding additional administrator accounts** and **using RDP Wrapper** are methods of lateral movement and persistence.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions the use of Mimikatz, which is a powerful tool for extracting credentials, including domain administrator passwords.
- The report also states that the attackers added additional administrator accounts and used RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions, which are actions that would be facilitated by having domain administrator credentials.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The attackers used Mimikatz, which is known for extracting domain administrator passwords.
2. The report explicitly mentions adding additional administrator accounts and using RDP Wrapper for concurrent RDP sessions, which are actions that require domain administrator access.
3. The sequence of TTPs described in the report aligns with the use of compromised domain administrator passwords to facilitate further lateral movement and persistence.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
