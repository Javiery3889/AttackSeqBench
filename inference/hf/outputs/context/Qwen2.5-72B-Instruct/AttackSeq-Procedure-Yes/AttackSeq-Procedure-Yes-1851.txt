### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The malware is initially delivered via an SFX executable with a decoy document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware checks for Russian or Ukrainian input languages and continues to run if neither is found.
     - It decrypts an embedded resource using a brute force method.
     - It sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
     - It collects various system information: machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address, and installed anti-virus software.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The malware sets up a scheduled task to run every 30 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware uses ConfuserEx to obfuscate its code.
     - It checks for the presence of anti-virus software and refrains from installing the keylogger component if any is detected.
   - **Collection:**
     - The malware includes a keylogger component that collects keystrokes and clipboard data.
     - The data is encrypted and stored in a specific folder.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicates with C2 servers using SOAP envelopes and WSHttpBinding() API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that VERMIN will collect system information (machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address) during its system information discovery phase before deploying its keylogger component to collect keystrokes and clipboard data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Information Collection:**
     - The report explicitly states that the malware collects various system information, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, and local IP address.
   - **Keylogger Component:**
     - The report mentions that the malware includes a keylogger component that collects keystrokes and clipboard data.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The malware first checks for the presence of anti-virus software and refrains from installing the keylogger component if any is detected.
     - The system information collection happens before the keylogger component is deployed, as it is part of the initial execution phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware uses ConfuserEx for defense evasion.
   - After obfuscation, the malware collects system information as part of its initial execution.
   - The keylogger component is deployed only if no anti-virus software is detected.
   - The sequence of actions is: obfuscation, system information collection, and then keylogger deployment (if no anti-virus is detected).
