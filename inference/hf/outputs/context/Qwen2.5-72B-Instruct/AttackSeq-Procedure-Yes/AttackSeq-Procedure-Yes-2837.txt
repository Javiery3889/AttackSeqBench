### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with a dropper malware written in Delphi, which downloads a second stage payload from the internet and executes it.
   - **Execution:** The second stage payload, 'upnphost.exe', is downloaded to '%APPDATA%\Local\Temp' and initiates contact with the command and control (C2) server.
   - **Persistence:** 'upnphost.exe' sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper uses evasion techniques, and the malware's behavior is revealed after patching.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information and process lists using the command 'cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo' and sends this information to an IP address in Hong Kong.
   - **Others:** The attack has a wide surface, with C2 servers in Europe and China.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware will use HTTPS communication as part of its command and control operations after discovering system information and process lists.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The dropper downloads and executes 'upnphost.exe', which communicates with the C2 server using HTTPS.
   - **Persistence:** The malware sets a registry key to maintain persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The dropper uses evasion techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers and sends system information and process lists to the C2 server.
   - **Communication Protocol:** The report explicitly states that the payload communicates with the server using the HTTPS protocol.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the malware uses HTTPS for communication with the C2 server.
   - The discovery phase, where the malware gathers and sends system information and process lists, is part of the overall attack sequence.
   - Given that the malware uses HTTPS for communication, it is highly likely that the same protocol will be used for sending the discovered information to the C2 server.
