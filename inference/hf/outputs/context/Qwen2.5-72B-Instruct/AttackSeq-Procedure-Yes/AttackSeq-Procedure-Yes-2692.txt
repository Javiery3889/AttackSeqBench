### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.
   - **Initial Access:** Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 in WinRAR via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Elfin deployed various custom and commodity malware, including DarkComet, Remcos, Quasar RAT, and others.
   - **Persistence:** Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging and deployed various backdoors.
   - **Credential Access:** Elfin used DarkComet for credential dumping.
   - **Exfiltration:** Elfin used custom FTP tools like FastUploader for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Elfin is likely to use web services such as POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for communication with compromised systems in the command and control phase before performing data exfiltration using FastUploader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms that Elfin used DarkComet for credential dumping.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The report mentions that Elfin deployed various backdoors, including POSHC2 and Quasar RAT, which are typically used for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Elfin used FastUploader for data exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the CTI report:
     1. **Credential Access:** DarkComet was used for credential dumping.
     2. **Command and Control:** POSHC2 and Quasar RAT are mentioned as tools used by Elfin, which are suitable for command and control.
     3. **Exfiltration:** FastUploader was used for data exfiltration.
   - The use of POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for command and control is consistent with the report's mention of Elfin deploying various backdoors and using web services for communication.
