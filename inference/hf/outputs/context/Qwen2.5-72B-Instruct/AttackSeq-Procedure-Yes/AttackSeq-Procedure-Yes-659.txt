### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Gallmaker delivered malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails.
- These documents exploited the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to execute commands in memory, avoiding leaving artifacts on disk.

**Execution:**
- Gallmaker executed various tools:
  - WindowsRoamingToolsTask for scheduling PowerShell scripts and tasks.
  - A 'reverse_tcp' payload from Metasploit via obfuscated PowerShell.
  - A legitimate version of the WinZip console for command execution and potential data exfiltration.
  - The Rex PowerShell library from GitHub for creating and manipulating PowerShell scripts for Metasploit exploits.

**Command and Control:**
- Gallmaker used three primary IP addresses for C&C infrastructure.
- They likely used the WinZip console to archive data for exfiltration.

**Exfiltration:**
- The legitimate version of the WinZip console was used to archive data, probably for exfiltration.

**Others:**
- Gallmaker targeted government, military, and defense sectors.
- They have been active since at least December 2017, with the most recent activity observed in June 2018.
- Their activities are indicative of a cyber espionage campaign, likely state-sponsored.
- Symantec's Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology played a crucial role in detecting Gallmaker's activities.
- Protections against Gallmaker attacks include System Infected: Meterpreter Reverse TCP and W97M.Downloader.
- Network protection products also detect activity associated with Gallmaker.
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) specific to Gallmaker have been updated, and Yara rules and methods used by Gallmaker are shared for detection of unauthorized activity.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering malicious Office documents via spear-phishing emails to exploit the DDE protocol for commands in memory, is Gallmaker likely to use living off the land (LotL) tactics and remove tools from the victim’s machines after executing PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads for defense evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Gallmaker used spear-phishing emails to deliver malicious Office documents.
- They exploited the DDE protocol to execute commands in memory.
- They used various tools, including PowerShell scripts and Metasploit payloads.
- They used legitimate tools (WinZip console) to avoid detection.
- They employed LotL tactics to avoid detection.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - Gallmaker used LotL tactics, which involve using legitimate tools and system utilities to avoid detection.
  - They executed PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads.
  - They likely removed tools from the victim’s machines to avoid leaving traces, which is a common defense evasion technique.
- **B: No**
  - This choice suggests that Gallmaker did not use LotL tactics or remove tools from the victim’s machines, which contradicts the information in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that Gallmaker used LotL tactics, which involve using legitimate tools and system utilities to avoid detection.
- They executed PowerShell-based Metasploit payloads, which are consistent with LotL tactics.
- The report also suggests that they used techniques to avoid leaving traces, which aligns with the practice of removing tools from the victim’s machines after execution.

**Final Answer:**
- Final Answer: A: Yes
