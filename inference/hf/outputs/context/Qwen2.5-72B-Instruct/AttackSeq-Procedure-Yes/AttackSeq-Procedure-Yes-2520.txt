### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Targeted Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software (CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2021-44026) to run reconnaissance and exfiltration scripts.
     - Scripts redirected incoming emails, performed reconnaissance, and exfiltrated session and user information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access by exploiting Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730.
     - Also exploited Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397.
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious scripts through Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     - Redirected future incoming emails and performed reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumped OS credentials from compromised systems, including /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
   - **Collection:**
     - Created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled email address.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used web protocols and standard encoding for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated data over alternative protocols, including session cookies, address books, and database information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after gaining credential access, the BlueDelta campaign will exploit vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities before collecting emails by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities to dump OS credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that the campaign performed reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server, which can be considered a form of discovery.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to forward all emails to an attacker-controlled email address.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the CTI report suggests that after gaining credential access, the campaign performed reconnaissance (discovery) activities on the Roundcube server.
   - This reconnaissance likely included gathering system information, network configuration, and user discovery to understand the environment better.
   - After this discovery phase, the campaign then proceeded to create a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to collect emails.
