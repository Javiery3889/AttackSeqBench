### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents, phishing websites on typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames leading to Java and Flash zero-day exploits.
   - **Execution:** The second stage component, installed by a dropper named winloat.exe, writes key components to the disk and deploys tools like a password dumper (run.exe), a privilege escalation tool (xp.exe), and a proxy tool (svehost.exe).
   - **Persistence:** APT28 changes the timestamps of all files downloaded by the second stage dropper to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT28 uses a tool exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2014-4076) to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool (svehost.exe) to contact systems behind routers.
   - **Credential Access:** APT28 deploys a password dumping tool (run.exe) based on the mimikatz source.
   - **Discovery:** APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. The bots used for scanning report back to a central server.
   - **Collection:** APT28 collects data by deploying additional modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** APT28's C&C communication is carried out via HTTP on port 443 or 80 if necessary.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT28 exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT28 is likely to probe potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots before employing crafted Word and Excel documents in spear phishing emails for gaining initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that APT28 discovers the environment by scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems. The bots used for scanning report back to a central server.
   - **Initial Access Phase:** The report clearly states that APT28 uses spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents as the initial method of gaining access.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     1. **Discovery:** Scanning IP ranges and identifying vulnerable systems.
     2. **Initial Access:** Using spear phishing emails with crafted Word and Excel documents.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not mention any specific activity of probing potential victims' identity information using geographically distributed scan bots before the initial access phase.
   - The sequence of actions described in the report suggests that APT28 first discovers the environment and then uses spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
   - There is no indication that APT28 probes identity information before sending spear phishing emails.
