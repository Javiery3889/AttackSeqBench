### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Gholee malware campaign used a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file named 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb'.
- The file was not initially detected as malicious by any antivirus engines.

**Execution:**
- Upon enabling Macro content, the victim is presented with a message that disappears to show different content.
- The Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable within a function.
- These functions are combined to create a single PE file, which is saved as NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll.
- The PE file is executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process.

**Command and Control:**
- The Gholee malware establishes command and control by communicating with a Kuwait-based IP address (83.170.33.60) owned by German company iABG Mbh.
- It opens an SSL connection over port 443 using an expired digital certificate issued to Core Security for *coreimpactagent.net by Thawte certificate authority.
- The malware's HTTP communication pattern includes GET and POST requests to /index.php with specific parameters.

**Others:**
- Related incidents reveal another file 'svchost 67.exe' uploaded to Virus Total from Latvia, which communicated with an IP address in the same netblock.
- Detection and prevention measures include disabling macro code via GPO, blocking files containing macro code at the email gateway, and monitoring logs and proxy servers for communication with the malware-associated IP addresses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the execution of the Gholee malware through the concatenated PE file NTUSER.data.{GUIDE}.dll using cmd.exe /C and Rundll32, is it likely that the malware will employ obfuscation and mechanisms to hide from sandbox software to evade detection before establishing a secure command-and-control connection using an expired digital certificate?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection.
- The PE file is executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 to hide the process.
- The malware establishes command and control using an SSL connection with an expired digital certificate.

**Evaluation:**
- The use of ASCII character codes and concatenation to create the PE file indicates an attempt to obfuscate the code and avoid detection.
- Executing the PE file using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32 suggests an effort to hide the process from the user and potentially from sandbox software.
- The establishment of a command and control connection using an SSL connection with an expired digital certificate further indicates an attempt to evade detection by security software.

**Conclusion:**
- The malware employs multiple obfuscation and hiding mechanisms before establishing the command and control connection.

#### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
