### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
- Documents designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

**Initial Access:**
- Initial access achieved through phishing emails with a Microsoft Word document containing VBS macros.
- Document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc' and 180 variants identified.

**Defense Evasion:**
- PowerShell script executed by the macro operates in memory to avoid detection.
- Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
- Leverages DCOM object to execute downloaded files without saving to disk.

**Command and Control:**
- PowerShell script communicates with hardcoded C2 servers.
- Uses DownloadString method to contact C2 server and DownloadData method to download resources from a second C2 server.

**Impact:**
- Payloads downloaded and executed are GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
- GandCrab encrypts files, Ursnif performs credential harvesting and gathers system information.

**Others:**
- Campaign analyzed using VirusTotal Graph.
- At least three variants of Ursnif hosted on bevendbrec[.]com.
- PowerShell cradle and PS Empire script used to inject GandCrab into memory.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Following the initial access gained through phishing emails containing a malicious Word document, is it likely that the encoded PowerShell script, retrieved via a VBS macro, will execute and subsequently download payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab malware?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Reconnaissance:** Phishing emails with malicious Word documents.
2. **Initial Access:** User opens the Word document, triggering the VBS macro.
3. **Defense Evasion:** VBS macro executes an encoded PowerShell script that operates in memory.
4. **Command and Control:** PowerShell script communicates with C2 servers.
5. **Impact:** PowerShell script downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab malware.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report clearly states that the VBS macro in the Word document triggers the execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
  - The PowerShell script then downloads and executes Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
  - This sequence aligns perfectly with the attack sequence described in the report.

- **B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the information provided in the CTI report.
  - The report explicitly mentions that the PowerShell script, executed by the VBS macro, downloads and executes the malware.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of events where the initial access is gained through a phishing email with a malicious Word document.
- The VBS macro in the document triggers the execution of an encoded PowerShell script.
- The PowerShell script then communicates with C2 servers to download and execute Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
- This sequence is consistent and logical, as described in the report.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
