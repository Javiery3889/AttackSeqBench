### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** The actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, upload tools (cURL, custom Mimikatz, Impacket's wmiexec, and atexec).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The actors used a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The actors ran commands to discover system and network information.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The actors dumped credentials using a variant of Mimikatz and used Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The actors used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate with the compromised server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the actors will perform OS credential dumping using Mimikatz before moving laterally to other systems using Impacket's atexec with the dumped credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the actors used the Dumpert tool to evade antivirus and EDR solutions.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The report explicitly states that the actors used a variant of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that the actors used Impacket's atexec to run commands on other systems using the dumped credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of actions described in the report aligns with the sequence in the question:
     1. **Defense Evasion:** The actors used the Dumpert tool to evade detection.
     2. **Credential Dumping:** The actors used a variant of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
     3. **Lateral Movement:** The actors used Impacket's atexec to move laterally using the dumped credentials.
   - The report clearly indicates that the actors performed credential dumping using Mimikatz before moving laterally with Impacket's atexec.
