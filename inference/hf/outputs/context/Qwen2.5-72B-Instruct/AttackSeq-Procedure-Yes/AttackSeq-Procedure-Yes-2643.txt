### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Dridex is spread using spambots (Necurs, Cutwail, Andromeda) that send emails with malicious documents.
     - These documents contain embedded macros that, when executed, download and execute the Dridex payload.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Dridex uses anti-debug techniques and obfuscation.
     - The loader generates a large number of debug messages using the `OutputDebugStringW` function, creating a loop with around 200 million iterations.
     - The payload uses hash values for call resolutions and RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Dridex communicates with C&C servers via encrypted POST requests containing various data.
     - The listed C&C servers are proxies for the real ones.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Dridex loader is likely to execute the `OutputDebugStringW` function as part of its anti-debugging techniques before employing RC4 encryption to obfuscate strings and evade detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs in the CTI Report:**
     1. **Initial Access:**
        - Malicious documents with embedded macros are sent via email.
        - Macros download and execute the Dridex payload.
     2. **Defense Evasion:**
        - The loader uses `OutputDebugStringW` to generate debug messages.
        - The payload uses RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.
   - **Sequence in the Question:**
     - The loader executes `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging.
     - The payload uses RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the loader uses the `OutputDebugStringW` function to generate a large number of debug messages as part of its anti-debugging techniques.
   - The report also mentions that the payload uses RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the sequence presented in the CTI report: the loader first uses `OutputDebugStringW` for anti-debugging, and then the payload uses RC4 encryption for obfuscation.
