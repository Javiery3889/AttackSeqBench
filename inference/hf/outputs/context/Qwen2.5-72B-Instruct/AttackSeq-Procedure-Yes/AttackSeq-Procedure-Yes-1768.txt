### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers gather email addresses and other information to target specific individuals or organizations.
   - **Resource Development:** The malware is self-contained and does not need to download additional content.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained through phishing emails.
   - **Execution:** The malware runs a self-extracting executable (WEXTRACT.exe) that drops and launches the Binder executable, which then checks the .NET version and drops the information stealer DLL component (DiagnosticsService.dll).
   - **Persistence:** Ensured by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses Base64 encoding and non-traditional methods for native to .NET interop.
   - **Credential Access:** Steals credentials for FTP clients, VPN client user configuration files, and RDP and Putty accounts.
   - **Collection:** Collects keystrokes, clipboard contents, browser bookmarks and cookies, chat history, and VPN-related account information. It also captures screenshots and collects data from removable media.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server to upload collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Sayad will collect system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies from the compromised host before uploading the encrypted collected data to the malicious web server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Sayad ensures persistence by modifying the registry to run at startup using rundll32.exe.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Sayad collects various types of data, including keystrokes, clipboard contents, browser bookmarks and cookies, chat history, and VPN-related account information. It also captures screenshots and collects data from removable media.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Sayad uploads the collected and encrypted data to a malicious web server.

   The report does not explicitly mention the collection of system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies. However, it is common for malware to collect such information to understand the environment and to identify additional targets or vulnerabilities. Given the comprehensive nature of the data collection described in the report, it is reasonable to infer that Sayad might also collect this type of information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report lists a wide range of data that Sayad collects, including sensitive information and system data.
   - While the specific collection of system information, running processes, open ports, and registered proxies is not explicitly mentioned, it is a logical extension of the malware's data collection capabilities.
   - The malware's goal is to gather as much information as possible to maximize its impact and to identify further targets or vulnerabilities.
