### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
- Victims are tricked into opening a PDF file containing a malicious Flash object or a Windows executable disguised as a document or image.
- The exploit uses CVE-2011-0611 to compromise the system.

**Execution:**
- The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- The loader has been updated over time, with the most recent version used by CosmicDuke starting in mid-April 2014.

**Persistence:**
- CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and a Windows service named 'javamtsup' with the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service.'
- The service binary reads the path of the actual malware binary from the registry and starts the malware using a duplicated token.
- The malware copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.

**Discovery:**
- CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns, including document, archive, and other file types.
- It targets non-English filenames, particularly those containing 'sifr' and 'sifer.'

**Collection:**
- CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
- It searches removable drives for files, skipping certain file types and drives with the volume name 'trandescend.'

**Command and Control:**
- CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav servers for exfiltrating data and updating the malware.
- The configuration, including server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

**Exfiltration:**
- The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.
- The report details the login credentials and FTP folder structure of the remote sites.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether CosmicDuke is likely to export certificates and associated private keys from the system store for credential access before searching for files on network and hard drives based on specific patterns for discovery.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Persistence:**
  - CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to ensure it runs persistently.
  - This step is clearly outlined in the report.

- **Discovery:**
  - CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives that match specific patterns.
  - This step is also clearly outlined in the report.

- **Credential Access:**
  - The report does not explicitly mention that CosmicDuke exports certificates and associated private keys from the system store.
  - The report focuses on the malware's ability to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information, but it does not specify the export of certificates and private keys.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The report details the steps CosmicDuke takes to achieve persistence and discovery.
- The report does not mention the export of certificates and private keys as part of the attack sequence.
- Given the information provided, it is more likely that CosmicDuke focuses on file discovery and collection using keyloggers and other tools rather than exporting certificates and private keys.

**Final Answer: B: No**
