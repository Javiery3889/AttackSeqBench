### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The attackers have deployed updated versions of their malware, Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe.
- Aumlib now encodes certain HTTP communications.
- Ixeshe exhibits new network traffic patterns to potentially evade detection.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The updated Aumlib malware encodes its HTTP POST body, differing from previous variants that transmitted data in clear text.
- The new Ixeshe sample uses a different Base64 encoding pattern in its network traffic.

**Others:**
- The attackers, known as APT12, have been silent since January after an expose and have now re-emerged with improved malware.
- The changes in their TTPs suggest a deliberate evolution in response to external pressures.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the Aumlib malware will:
- Download its updated sample from specific URLs.
- Share code with an older variant as part of the attackers' command and control activity.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Aumlib and Ixeshe have been updated to encode their communications.
- The encoding is designed to evade detection by IDS.
- The attackers have evolved their TTPs in response to external pressures.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**

**Choice A: Yes**
- This choice suggests that Aumlib will download updated samples from specific URLs and share code with older variants.
- The report does not explicitly state that Aumlib will download updated samples from specific URLs or share code with older variants.
- However, it is plausible that the attackers might use such techniques to maintain persistence and evade detection, given their history of evolving TTPs.

**Choice B: No**
- This choice suggests that Aumlib will not download updated samples from specific URLs or share code with older variants.
- The report does not provide direct evidence to support this claim either.

**Reasoning:**
- The report emphasizes the attackers' efforts to evade detection and their deliberate evolution of TTPs.
- Downloading updated samples from specific URLs and sharing code with older variants are common techniques used by sophisticated threat actors to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- Given the context of APT12's history and the deliberate changes in their TTPs, it is reasonable to infer that they might employ such techniques.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes
