### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing documents (Office Excel files) with malicious macros.
     - Macros release and execute a backdoor program.
     - Backdoor uses complex DNS tunneling for C2 communication.
     - Backdoor uses Google Drive API for file uploads and downloads.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious macro code in the Excel file releases and executes WINDOWSTEMP.ps1 and 12-B-366.txt (HTA file).
     - PowerShell script decodes and decompresses content, writes it to OfficeUpdateService.exe, and executes it.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Backdoor checks for "st:off" and "pd:off" parameters.
     - If checks pass, it writes startup items for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Backdoor performs checks for virtual machines, sandboxes, and debugging environments.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Backdoor gathers host information after executing evasion techniques.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the backdoor program will establish communication with the C2 server via DNS tunneling and communicate to receive commands after gathering host information following successful evasion techniques.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The backdoor is released and executed via malicious macros in an Excel file.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor writes startup items for persistence if certain parameters are not set.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor performs checks to avoid detection in virtual machines, sandboxes, and debugging environments.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor gathers host information after executing evasion techniques.
   - **Communication:**
     - The backdoor uses complex DNS tunneling to communicate with the C2 server and execute commands.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the backdoor program uses complex DNS tunneling techniques to communicate with the C2 server and execute commands.
   - After performing evasion techniques and gathering host information, it is logical that the backdoor would establish communication with the C2 server to receive further commands.
