### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Used Windows utilities and third-party tools like adfind and PowerSploit to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Employed spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Abused elevation control mechanisms and hijacked execution flow.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used various techniques to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Compressed files and used cloud services for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network before engaging in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The CTI report explicitly states that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the compromised network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention internal spear phishing as a method for lateral movement. However, it does mention the use of remote services and other techniques for maintaining access and moving laterally.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The discovery phase typically precedes lateral movement in a cyber attack. After discovering the network topology and identifying potential targets, the threat actor would then move laterally to gain access to other systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - While the report does not explicitly mention internal spear phishing for lateral movement, it is a plausible technique that could be used after discovery to gain access to other systems.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The logical sequence of events in a cyber attack often involves discovery followed by lateral movement. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Earth Lusca would use the discovered information to facilitate lateral movement.
