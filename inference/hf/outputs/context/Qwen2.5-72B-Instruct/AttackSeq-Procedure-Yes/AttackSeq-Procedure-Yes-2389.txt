### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used malware to gather system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths on the host system.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade network security solutions.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - **Others:**
     - The malware used a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine observed in previous Operation Troy samples. The C2 servers were compromised websites, possibly due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet after performing discovery activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:**
     - The report clearly states that the malware performed discovery activities to collect system and network information.
   - **Communication with C2 Servers:**
     - The report mentions that the C2 server used a custom base64 alphabet and a distinct string decryption routine, which aligns with the question's mention of encrypted and base64-encoded commands.
   - **Custom Base64 Alphabet:**
     - The report explicitly states that the malware used a custom base64 alphabet, which is a key detail in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware TDrop2 performed discovery activities to gather system and network information.
   - After discovery, the malware is likely to communicate with C2 servers.
   - The report indicates that the C2 communication involves the use of a custom base64 alphabet and encrypted commands.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the TDrop2 malware will communicate with C2 servers using encrypted and base64-encoded commands by leveraging a custom base64 alphabet.
