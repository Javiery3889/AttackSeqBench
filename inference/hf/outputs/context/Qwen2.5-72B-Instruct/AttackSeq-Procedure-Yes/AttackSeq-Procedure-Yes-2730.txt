### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Execution:** The malware ThreatNeedle was executed in a multistage deployment procedure.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware registered the next stage loader-type malware for auto-execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group deleted log files, used a custom web shell script, and employed masquerading techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** The group used a credential harvesting tool named Responder to acquire login credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The group conducted various discovery activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Command and Control:** The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers and a compromised router.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to archive collected data using utilities before exfiltrating it through a covert channel created by a custom tunneling tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the group used Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections for lateral movement.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.
   - **Archiving:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of archiving utilities before exfiltration. However, it is common in advanced cyber attacks to archive data to reduce the number of exfiltration attempts and to make the data transfer more efficient and less detectable.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the Lazarus group used archiving utilities, it is a plausible step in the exfiltration process. Advanced threat actors often use archiving to compress and encrypt data before exfiltration to reduce the size and increase the stealth of the data transfer.
   - The use of a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader suggests that the group was highly sophisticated and likely employed additional steps to ensure the efficiency and stealth of the exfiltration process.
