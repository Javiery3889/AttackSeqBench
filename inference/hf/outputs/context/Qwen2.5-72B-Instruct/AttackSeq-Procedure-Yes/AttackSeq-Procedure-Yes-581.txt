### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** They used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, ping systems of interest, and upload tools like cURL, a custom Mimikatz variant, and Impacket tools.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and Dumpert to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory and Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used webshells and Impacket's atexec tool to move laterally to other systems on the network.
   - **Command and Control:** They used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate with the compromised server and run commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actors will use commands to discover remote systems before moving laterally using credentials with Impacket's atexec tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial System and User Discovery:** The report mentions that the actors used the webshell to run commands for initial system and user discovery and to ping systems of interest. This indicates that they performed reconnaissance to identify potential targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools to perform pass-the-hash and move laterally to other systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The logical sequence of actions would be:
     1. **Initial Access and Webshell Installation**
     2. **Execution and Reconnaissance** (discovering remote systems and users)
     3. **Credential Access** (dumping credentials)
     4. **Lateral Movement** (using dumped credentials to move to other systems)

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the actors performed reconnaissance (discovering remote systems) before moving laterally. This is a common and logical sequence in cyber attacks to ensure that the actors have a clear understanding of the network topology and potential targets before attempting lateral movement.
