### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The SideWinder APT group exploited CVE-2019-2215 to compromise devices via malicious apps on Google Play.
   - **Execution:** The callCam app, once installed, hides its icon and executes in the background to collect sensitive information.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** SideWinder used device rooting and accessibility permissions for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group employed obfuscation, data encryption, and dynamic code invocation to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The callCam app collected extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Command and Control:** The C&C server was used to communicate with compromised devices and download additional payloads.
   - **Exfiltration:** The callCam app encrypted the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, verified data integrity with SHA256, and customized the encoding routine before exfiltrating it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the callCam app is likely to encrypt the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms during the Collection phase, before sending it to the C&C server using a customized encoding routine in the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report clearly states that the callCam app collected extensive information from compromised devices.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report specifies that the callCam app encrypted the collected data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, verified data integrity with SHA256, and customized the encoding routine before exfiltrating it to the C&C server.
   - **Collection Phase:** The term "Collection" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework typically refers to the process of gathering data from the victim's system, which is part of the Discovery phase. The encryption and encoding of data for exfiltration are part of the Exfiltration phase.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly mention encryption during the Collection phase. Instead, it clearly states that the encryption and encoding happen during the Exfiltration phase.
   - The question asks if the encryption happens during the Collection phase, which is not supported by the report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
