### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information such as usernames, computer names, RDP session IDs, and drive types. Probed files in specified directories.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow, after using cmd.exe to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor for Execution, will collect system information and probe files as part of the Discovery phase before dumping credentials from compromised systems using a custom version of Mimikatz for Credential Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The report confirms that FamousSparrow used cmd.exe to execute the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files in specified directories.
   - **Credential Access:** The report does not mention the use of Mimikatz or any other tool for dumping credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that FamousSparrow performed the Execution and Discovery phases as described in the question.
   - However, the report does not provide any information about the use of Mimikatz or any other tool for Credential Access.
   - Given the lack of information about Credential Access, it is not possible to confirm that FamousSparrow used a custom version of Mimikatz for this purpose.
