### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers used watering hole tactics to compromise websites related to North Korea.
     - They injected exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 into these websites.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Chrome exploit vector involved chaining two patched vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-5782 and an unnamed Chrome bug) to execute custom shellcode.
     - The shellcode de-obfuscated strings, initialized a network connection, and downloaded a payload named 'dropper.dll' from a C&C server.
     - The dropper.dll checked for security software presence and, if none were detected, downloaded and executed three additional malware samples.
     - An Internet Explorer exploit vector using CVE-2020-0674 ran a PowerShell loader to infect victims with the same three malware variants.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers implemented checks for security software during malware deployment to avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect information about the infected machines.
     - It executed commands to exfiltrate system information and captured screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The SLUB malware variant communicated with a Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.
     - It created individual channels for each infected machine and used a notification channel for real-time updates.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The SLUB malware variant exfiltrated system information and captured screenshots to the Mattermost server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers will use the PowerShell loader to execute backdoors with system privileges for privilege escalation after initial access and execution of custom shellcode to download and run a PowerShell loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the attackers used watering hole tactics and exploits (CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782) to gain initial access.
     - The custom shellcode downloaded a payload named 'dropper.dll' and a PowerShell loader.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention privilege escalation using the PowerShell loader.
     - However, the use of a PowerShell loader to download and execute additional malware samples suggests that the attackers are capable of executing complex commands and potentially escalating privileges.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The attackers implemented checks for security software and used a Mattermost server for command and control, indicating a sophisticated and organized campaign.
     - The use of multiple C&C servers and exploits for N-day bugs further supports the idea that the attackers are well-resourced and capable of advanced techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers used a combination of exploits and a PowerShell loader to gain initial access and execute custom shellcode.
   - The shellcode and PowerShell loader were used to download and execute additional malware samples.
   - The attackers implemented checks for security software and used a sophisticated C&C infrastructure, suggesting a high level of capability.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the PowerShell loader was used for privilege escalation, the sophisticated nature of the attack and the use of multiple exploits and malware samples make it likely that the attackers would attempt to escalate privileges to maintain control and further their objectives.
