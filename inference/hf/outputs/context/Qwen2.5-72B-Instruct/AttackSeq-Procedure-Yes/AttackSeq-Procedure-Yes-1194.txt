### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The BlackEnergy APT group used Excel documents with macros to drop the BlackEnergy Trojan.
- A new attack vector involved a Microsoft Word document named "$RR143TB.doc" with macros.
- The document enticed users to enable macros to view content related to the "Right Sector" party in Ukraine.
- Upon enabling macros, the payload "vba_macro.exe" was executed, which dropped a DLL file as "%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT" and ensured persistence through a LNK file in the startup folder.

**Execution:**
- Enabling macros in the Word document led to the execution of "vba_macro.exe" using the Shell command, which executed the BlackEnergy dropper.

**Persistence:**
- The BlackEnergy dropper created a LNK file in the system startup folder to ensure execution on every system boot. The command executed was "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1".

**Impact:**
- The BlackEnergy APT group's attacks focused on destructive actions, compromising industrial control installations, and espionage activities.
- The earliest signs of destructive payloads with BlackEnergy date back to June 2014, with recent attacks showing more sophisticated high-level wiping capabilities targeting file extensions.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky Lab's products detect the various trojans mentioned as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten.* and HEUR:Trojan-Downloader.Script.Generic.
- More information about BlackEnergy APT and extended IOCs are available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Services.
- For countering BlackEnergy and similar threats, Kaspersky Business Blog provides additional insights.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After ensuring persistence by creating a LNK file in the system startup folder to execute "rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\FONTCACHE.DAT\",#1" on every system boot, is it likely that the BlackEnergy Trojan will connect to its hardcoded C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114 on port 80 to issue an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The final payload connected to a C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114, which is currently offline.
- The report mentions that the payload connects to the C&C server, but it does not specify the method of communication (e.g., HTTP POST, BASE64 encoding).

**Evaluation:**
- The report confirms that the payload connects to the C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114.
- However, the report does not provide specific details about the method of communication (HTTP POST, BASE64 encoding).
- Given that the C&C server is currently offline, it is less likely that the Trojan will successfully connect and send an HTTP POST request with BASE64-encoded victim information.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report confirms that the payload connects to the C&C server at 5.149.254[.]114.
2. The report does not specify the method of communication (HTTP POST, BASE64 encoding).
3. The C&C server is currently offline, which reduces the likelihood of a successful connection and data transmission.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
