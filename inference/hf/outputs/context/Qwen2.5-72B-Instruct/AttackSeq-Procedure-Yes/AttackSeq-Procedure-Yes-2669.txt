### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, delivered through an email attachment.
     - The zip file contains a file disguised as a Microsoft Word document icon, which is actually an application bundle containing executable code.
     - When the user attempts to open the decoy Word document, the Trojan executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor opens a hidden file named .CFUserEncoding from the application bundle's Resources folder.
     - It copies this file to the executable path, replacing the application bundle after persistence is established.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up.
     - It copies itself to a location and filename based on the user's UID, using a segmented MD5 hash as a directory.
     - The malware deletes the original application bundle, leaving the decoy document, and launches itself as a service from the new location.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor avoids the use of command line utilities and suspicious strings.
     - It employs a robust string encoding mechanism to obfuscate its functions.
     - The malware uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server.
     - It gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which is then encrypted and sent to the command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer to gather details such as the victim's name and system information before initiating command and control communication using a custom binary protocol encrypted with AES in CBC mode.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - From the CTI report, we know that the backdoor performs the following actions:
     - **Discovery:** The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information.
     - **Command and Control Communication:** The backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - The report explicitly states that the backdoor gathers this information and sends it back to the server, which implies that the surveying happens before the communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor's sequence of actions includes:
     1. **Initial Access:** The user opens the decoy document, and the backdoor executes.
     2. **Execution:** The backdoor opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path.
     3. **Persistence:** The backdoor creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a new location.
     4. **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor employs various techniques to avoid detection.
     5. **Discovery:** The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and gathers system information.
     6. **Command and Control Communication:** The backdoor sends the gathered information to the command and control server using a custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - The sequence clearly shows that the backdoor surveys the victim's computer before initiating command and control communication.
