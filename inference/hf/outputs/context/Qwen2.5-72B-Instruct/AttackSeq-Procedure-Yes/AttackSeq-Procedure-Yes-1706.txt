### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla spyware infects government computers, suggesting an Initial Access tactic.
   - **Persistence:** The malware establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks, allowing persistent access.
   - **Collection:** Turla's operators can download specialized tools onto an infected system, including password stealers, programs for gathering system information, and document stealers.
   - **Command and Control:** Turla uses multiple command and control servers to control infected systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Turla will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before downloading specialized tools for Collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that Turla establishes a hidden foothold, which is a form of Persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of a rootkit for Defense Evasion. However, the hidden foothold could imply some form of evasion to maintain access.
   - **Collection:** The report clearly states that Turla's operators download specialized tools for Collection, including password stealers and document stealers.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Hidden Foothold and Rootkit:** While the report does not explicitly state the use of a rootkit, the hidden foothold suggests that Turla employs some form of Defense Evasion to maintain persistence. Rootkits are a common method for achieving this.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The logical sequence would be to establish a hidden foothold (Persistence), then use a rootkit to conceal the operation (Defense Evasion), and finally download specialized tools for Collection.

### Final Answer
Given the context and the logical sequence of actions, it is likely that Turla will include a rootkit for Defense Evasion before downloading specialized tools for Collection.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
