### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory. They removed all disk-resident tools after use.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom versions of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) and other techniques like dynamic DLL loading, code injection, and token manipulation.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit, loaded directly into memory without writing to disk.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders over SMB and dropped NodeIISWeb web shell loaders.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on IIS request handling and using NodeIISWeb for backdoor functionality.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 demonstrated significant efforts to avoid detection by removing all disk-resident tools as part of their defense evasion strategy, specifically after using a custom version of the Potato family tools for privilege escalation.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** The report states that TG1021 "actively removed all disk-resident tools after using them, effectively giving up on persistency in exchange for stealth." This indicates a clear effort to avoid detection by not leaving traces on the disk.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) for privilege escalation. This is a specific technique used to gain higher privileges on the system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The removal of disk-resident tools is a significant effort to avoid detection, as it reduces the footprint of the attack and makes it harder for defenders to identify and respond to the threat.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** TG1021 used a custom version of the Potato family tools (PotatoEx.dll) for privilege escalation.
   - **Step 2:** After using these tools, TG1021 removed all disk-resident tools to avoid detection.
   - **Step 3:** The removal of disk-resident tools is a clear indication of a defense evasion strategy to maintain stealth.
