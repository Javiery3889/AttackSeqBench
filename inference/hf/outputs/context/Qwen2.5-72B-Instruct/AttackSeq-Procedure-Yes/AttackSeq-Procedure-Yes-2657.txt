### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Korplug creates a hidden directory and sets up persistence via a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via a custom TCP-based protocol with a header and a compressed, encrypted message body.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug is likely to communicate with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol, with the initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent encrypted communication over TCP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration Details from the Report:**
     - The report states that data exfiltration is performed via a custom TCP-based protocol.
     - The protocol involves TCP messages with a header followed by a compressed and encrypted message body.
   - **Initial Handshake:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention an initial handshake over HTTPS or TCP.
   - **Subsequent Communication:**
     - The report confirms that the communication is encrypted and over TCP.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for exfiltration.
   - The protocol involves encrypted communication over TCP.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention an initial handshake over HTTPS, it is common for malware to use HTTPS for the initial handshake to avoid detection and then switch to a custom protocol for subsequent communication.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Mustang Panda's campaign and their use of anti-analysis techniques, it is plausible that they would use an initial HTTPS handshake to establish a secure connection before switching to a custom TCP-based protocol.
