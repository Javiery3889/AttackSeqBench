### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary with various utilities.
     - It replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - It executes shell scripts as the root user of the device.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives.
     - It checks that it is executed by `init` and at the path for the legitimate `netd`.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - It scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information.
     - It deploys `tcpdump` to sniff network traffic.
   - **Discovery:**
     - It enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
     - It performs IP scanning of the local network.
   - **Collection:**
     - It collects files from the local system based on predefined file extensions.
     - It collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - It provides SCP functionality and a Tor hidden service for relaying connections to SSH.
     - It provides a local Socks connection and SSH server/client.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - It exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:**
     - It replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Infamous Chisel will persist on the system by:
     - Replacing the legitimate `netd` system binary.
     - Checking if `init` is the parent process.
     - Executing the legitimate process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report states that Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
     - It checks that it is executed by `init` and at the path for the legitimate `netd`.
   - **Backup Execution:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention that it executes the legitimate `netd` process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`.
     - However, it is a common technique for malware to execute the legitimate process to avoid detection and maintain system functionality.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
     - Infamous Chisel replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
     - It executes shell scripts as the root user for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - It checks that it is executed by `init` and at the path for the legitimate `netd` to ensure it is run as intended.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Replacing the legitimate `netd` and ensuring it is executed by `init` is a clear indication of persistence.
   - **Backup Execution:**
     - While not explicitly stated, it is a plausible and common technique for malware to execute the legitimate process to avoid detection.
