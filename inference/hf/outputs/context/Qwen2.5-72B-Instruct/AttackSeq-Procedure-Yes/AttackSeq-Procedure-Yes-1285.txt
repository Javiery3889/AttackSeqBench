### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tropic Trooper used exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 to execute commands.
     - They downloaded and installed an MSI package from a remote server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The system configuration file (in.sys) dropped a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) and deleted itself.
     - UserInstall.exe dropped a normal sidebar.exe, a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted configuration file.
     - UserInstall.exe used BITSadmin to create a job and launch sidebar.exe.
     - The malicious loader used DLL hijacking on sidebar.exe to launch dllhost.exe and inject a DLL backdoor into it.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor will load and decrypt the encrypted configuration file.
     - It will use SSL to connect to C&C servers.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade antivirus detection.
     - The installer dropped files into the Apple/Update directory and created a hidden directory (UFile).
     - The loader executed dllhost.exe and injected a malicious DLL file (the backdoor) into this process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper's C&C server during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence Phase:**
     - The report explicitly states that the backdoor will use SSL to connect to C&C servers.
   - **Defense Evasion Phase:**
     - The report mentions that Tropic Trooper used DLL hijacking to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control Phase:**
     - The report indicates that the backdoor will use SSL to connect to C&C servers, which aligns with the question's focus on TClient using SSL.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the backdoor will use SSL to connect to C&C servers.
   - TClient is part of the backdoor's functionality, as it is responsible for decrypting the C&C information and using custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.
   - The use of SSL for C&C communication is a common technique to evade detection and ensure secure communication between the malware and the attacker's server.
