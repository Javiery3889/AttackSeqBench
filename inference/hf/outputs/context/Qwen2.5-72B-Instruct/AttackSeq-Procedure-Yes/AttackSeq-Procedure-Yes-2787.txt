### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden, and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether the app is likely to send the gathered information via HTTP before uploading files via FTP as part of its Command and Control (C2) operations.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The app collects a wide range of information.
- The report does not explicitly mention the method of exfiltration (HTTP, FTP, etc.).

**Common TTPs for Data Exfiltration:**
- Malware often uses HTTP or HTTPS for initial data exfiltration due to its commonality and ease of use.
- FTP is less common for real-time data exfiltration but can be used for bulk data transfer.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This suggests that the app sends data via HTTP first and then uses FTP for file uploads.
- **B: No** - This suggests that the app does not follow the sequence of sending data via HTTP before using FTP.

**Reasoning:**
- The report does not explicitly state the exfiltration methods, but it is common for malware to use HTTP for initial data exfiltration due to its stealth and commonality.
- FTP is typically used for bulk data transfer, which might follow after initial data exfiltration via HTTP.
- Given the sophistication of the malware (as indicated by its ability to hide and restart), it is plausible that it uses HTTP for initial data exfiltration and FTP for bulk data transfer.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes
