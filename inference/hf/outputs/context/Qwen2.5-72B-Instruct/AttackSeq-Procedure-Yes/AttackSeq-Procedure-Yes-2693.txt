### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Elfin has been scanning for vulnerable websites to identify potential targets.
   - **Initial Access:** Elfin attempted to exploit CVE-2018-20250 in WinRAR via spear-phishing.
   - **Execution:** Elfin deployed various tools, including custom and commodity malware.
   - **Persistence:** Elfin created a scheduled task to execute a malicious VBE file.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging and deployed various backdoors and RATs.
   - **Command and Control:** Elfin used POSHC2 and other tools to maintain control over infected systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** Elfin exfiltrated data using custom FTP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Elfin will:
     1. Bypass logging on the infected machine using PowerShell commands.
     2. Deploy DarkComet with a credential dumping tool to extract credentials.
     3. Proceed with command and control communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT after extracting credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Elfin used PowerShell commands to bypass logging, which aligns with the first step in the question.
   - **Credential Dumping:** The report mentions that Elfin engaged in credential dumping activities, which aligns with the second step in the question.
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that Elfin used POSHC2 and Quasar RAT for command and control, which aligns with the third step in the question.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Elfin bypasses logging using PowerShell commands. This is explicitly mentioned in the report under the "Defense Evasion" section.
   - **Step 2:** Elfin deploys DarkComet with a credential dumping tool to extract credentials. The report mentions the use of DarkComet and credential dumping activities, which supports this step.
   - **Step 3:** Elfin proceeds with command and control communications using tools like POSHC2 and Quasar RAT. The report confirms the use of these tools for maintaining control over infected systems.

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
