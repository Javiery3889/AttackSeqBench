### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The rootkit CEIDPageLock is distributed via the RIG Exploit kit.
- It tampers with the victim's browser homepage, redirecting it to a site pretending to be 2345.com.

**Persistence:**
- The dropper extracts and saves the driver (houzi.sys) in the \Windows\Temp directory.
- The driver is registered and started, and the dropper sends the MAC address and user-id to a C&C domain (www[.]tj999[.]top).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver launched during startup.
- It employs tricks to evade and hide from endpoint security products.
- The driver connects to C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which is encrypted.

**Command and Control:**
- The driver connects to C&C domains to download the homepage configuration to tamper with the browser.

**Others:**
- CEIDPageLock targets Chinese victims specifically.
- The malware adds a registry key in 360Safe's security product as part of the rootkit installation routine.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report primarily describes the rootkit's activities in terms of initial access, persistence, and defense evasion.
- The main goal of the rootkit is to tamper with the browser homepage and redirect it to a specific site.
- There is no mention of collecting browsing data or using it for targeted ad campaigns or selling to marketing companies.
- The focus of the report is on the technical aspects of the rootkit and its primary objectives, which do not include data collection for marketing purposes.
