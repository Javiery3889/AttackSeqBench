### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Execution**: The report describes a new code injection technique called AtomBombing.
- **Mechanism**: AtomBombing leverages atom tables in the Windows operating system to inject malicious code.
- **Impact**: This technique affects all versions of Windows and cannot be patched.
- **Evasion**: It is designed to bypass security solutions such as antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After executing malicious code by exploiting atom tables in the AtomBombing technique, is it likely that threat actors will use this capability to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the Report**:
  - AtomBombing uses atom tables to inject malicious code.
  - It is designed to bypass security solutions.
  - It can manipulate legitimate programs to execute the injected code.

- **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
  - **Choice A: Yes**
    - This choice aligns with the report's description of AtomBombing. The technique is designed to inject code into trusted processes and bypass security products, which implies that it can be used to bypass process-level restrictions.
  - **Choice B: No**
    - This choice contradicts the report's description. The report clearly states that AtomBombing is designed to bypass security solutions and manipulate legitimate programs, which suggests that it can be used to inject code into trusted processes.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The report emphasizes that AtomBombing is a code injection technique that leverages atom tables to inject malicious code into trusted processes.
  - The primary purpose of AtomBombing is to bypass security solutions, which implies that it can be used to evade process-level restrictions.
  - Therefore, it is highly likely that threat actors will use this capability to inject code into trusted processes and evade security products.

- **Final Answer**: A: Yes
