### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. The dropper was disguised as an invitation to a G20 task force meeting.
   - **Execution:** The MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. The JavaScript dropper installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
   - **Persistence:** The JavaScript dropper creates a scheduled task named PolicyConverter for persistence, set to run every 10 minutes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The JavaScript dropper fingerprints the infected system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion. The backdoor communicates with compromised legitimate websites using a hardcoded HTTP User-Agent.
   - **Discovery:** Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file.
   - **Command and Control:** The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests. The backdoor can receive commands from the C&C, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the KopiLuwak backdoor, after communicating with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests, is likely to exfiltrate files to the C2 server while also being able to download files to the infected machine.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control (C2) Capabilities:** The report explicitly states that the KopiLuwak backdoor can receive commands from the C&C, including exfiltrating data, downloading files, and executing arbitrary commands.
   - **Exfiltration and Downloading:** The backdoor's capabilities include both exfiltrating data and downloading files, which are mentioned as part of the C2 commands it can receive.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the KopiLuwak backdoor can perform multiple actions, including exfiltrating data and downloading files.
   - The backdoor communicates with the C2 server using HTTP POST requests, and the C2 server can issue commands to the backdoor.
   - Since the backdoor is capable of receiving commands to exfiltrate data and download files, it is plausible that it can perform both actions.
