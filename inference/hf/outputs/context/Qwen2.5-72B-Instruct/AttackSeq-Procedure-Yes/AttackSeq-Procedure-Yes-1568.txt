### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Turla uses PowerShell to run malware directly in memory, bypassing disk-based detection mechanisms.

**Persistence:**
- Turla employs WMI event subscriptions and modifies the PowerShell profile (profile.ps1) to ensure persistence.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Turla encrypts payloads, obfuscates scripts, and uses an AMSI bypass technique to evade detection.

**Discovery:**
- Turla uses the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor for lateral movement and control within a local network.
- The RPC backdoor supports plugins that can gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.
- PowerStallion monitors antimalware logs and the Windows process list.

**Command and Control:**
- The RPC backdoor uses the RPC protocol.
- PowerStallion uses Microsoft OneDrive via SMB.

**Exfiltration:**
- PowerStallion exfiltrates information through OneDrive, encrypting it with an XOR key.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After implementing file upload and download capabilities with its RPC backdoor during the discovery phase, is Turla likely to use its backdoor plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives during the collection phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The RPC backdoor supports plugins that can gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.
- The discovery phase involves using the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion backdoor for lateral movement and control.
- The collection phase is implied by the capabilities of the backdoors, particularly the ability to gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the RPC backdoor supports plugins that can gather file and directory information and monitor USB drives.
- This capability aligns with the collection phase, where the threat actor would likely use these plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives.
- The file upload and download capabilities mentioned in the discovery phase suggest that Turla is already engaged in activities that involve file manipulation, making it plausible that they would use the backdoor plugins for further collection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report indicates that the RPC backdoor has plugins capable of gathering file and directory information and monitoring USB drives.
2. The discovery phase involves using these backdoors for lateral movement and control, which suggests that Turla is already engaged in file manipulation activities.
3. The collection phase is a logical next step where Turla would use these plugins to collect recent files and files from USB drives.
4. The capabilities of the backdoors and the nature of the threat actor's operations make it highly likely that Turla would use these plugins for collection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
