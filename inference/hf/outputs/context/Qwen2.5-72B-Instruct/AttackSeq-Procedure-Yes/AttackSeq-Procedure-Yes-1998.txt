### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla APT group used a .NET/MSIL dropper to deliver the JS/KopiLuwak backdoor. The dropper was disguised as an invitation to a G20 task force meeting.
   - **Execution:** The MSIL dropper deploys a PDF decoy and a JavaScript dropper. The JavaScript dropper installs a JS decryptor, which then decrypts and executes the KopiLuwak backdoor in memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The JavaScript dropper Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and sets up persistence without raising suspicion.
   - **Discovery:** Scr.js fingerprints the infected system by executing various commands and saving the output to a temporary file.
   - **Command and Control:** The KopiLuwak backdoor communicates with two compromised legitimate websites using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor can exfiltrate files to the C&C and download files to the infected machine.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the file Scr.js will drop the scheduled task PolicyConverter for persistence before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js containing the KopiLuwak backdoor code.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion and Persistence:**
     - The report mentions that Scr.js sets up persistence without raising suspicion.
     - The term "persistence" in the context of malware typically involves creating a mechanism to ensure the malware runs again after a system reboot or at regular intervals.
     - A common method for persistence is creating a scheduled task.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - Scr.js fingerprints the infected system and performs discovery tasks.
     - After fingerprinting and discovery, it is logical for the malware to set up persistence to ensure it remains on the system.
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but the logical sequence would be to set up persistence after gathering necessary information about the system.

4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - **A: Yes**
     - This choice suggests that Scr.js will drop the scheduled task PolicyConverter for persistence before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js.
     - This aligns with the logical sequence of actions described in the report.
   - **B: No**
     - This choice suggests that Scr.js will not drop the scheduled task PolicyConverter for persistence before the task PolicyConverter executes the file appidpolicyconverter.js.
     - This does not align with the logical sequence of actions described in the report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
