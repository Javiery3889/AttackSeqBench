### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, deobfuscation, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into documents and using Outlook VBA macros to send emails.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon will use malware to take screenshots every minute before employing HTTP and HTTPS for command and control, after using their backdoors to list interesting files on a system for future exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that Gamaredon's backdoors automatically list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The report mentions that the group's malware uses both HTTP and HTTPS for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.
   - **Screenshots:** The report does not mention any activity related to taking screenshots every minute.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by Gamaredon, but it does not include any information about taking screenshots every minute.
   - The focus of the group's activities, as described in the report, is on initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - The group's primary goal appears to be gathering sensitive information and spreading quickly, rather than engaging in continuous screenshotting.
