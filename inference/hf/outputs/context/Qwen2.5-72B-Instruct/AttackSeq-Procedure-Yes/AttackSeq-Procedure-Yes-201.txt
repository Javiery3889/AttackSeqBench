### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - **Execution:** They used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** They created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. They also used DLL search order hijacking to load the malicious K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files or information.
   - **Credential Access:** They used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** SparrowDoor collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** They read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** SparrowDoor communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted/decrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow would acquire infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development before using cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera.
   - Immediately after gaining Initial Access, they used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - The report does not mention any steps related to acquiring infrastructure from Hosting Concepts, Shanghai Ruisu Network Technology, and DAOU TECHNOLOGY for Resource Development before the Execution phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is:
     1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities.
     2. **Execution:** Using cmd.exe to download and install SparrowDoor.
   - There is no indication in the report that FamousSparrow acquired infrastructure from the mentioned companies before the Execution phase.
   - The acquisition of infrastructure for Resource Development is typically a preparatory step that occurs before the actual attack, but the report does not provide any evidence of this happening in this specific attack sequence.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
