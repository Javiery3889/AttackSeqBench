### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The 'yty' framework uses a malicious Excel document named 'Circular.xls' with macros to execute an embedded executable.

**Execution:**
- The framework includes two downloaders: a stripped-down C++ program (Downloader 1) and a more functional downloader (Downloader 2) with anti-sandbox detection.

**Persistence:**
- A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' ensures persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The framework uses junk code, anti-sandbox detection, and creates logs for debugging.

**Collection:**
- The framework collects files, takes screenshots, and logs keystrokes using plugins like 'vstservice.exe', 'mdriver.exe', and 'dspcheck.exe'.

**Command and Control:**
- The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise traffic, downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host, and sends beacon messages with system information.

**Others:**
- The Donot Team is believed to be behind 'yty', and they mimic legitimate applications and services. Their TTPs, infrastructure, and malware code are similar to the EHDevel malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the 'yty' framework exfiltrates gathered data (file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots) back to the C2 server using automated methods described in its exfiltration mechanism.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The 'yty' framework is capable of file collection, keylogging, and taking screenshots.
- It uses a C2 server to send beacon messages containing system information.
- The C2 server responds with instructions for further actions.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report mentions that the framework collects files, takes screenshots, and logs keystrokes.
  - It also states that the framework sends beacon messages containing system information to the C2 server.
  - Given the capabilities and the communication strategy, it is highly likely that the collected data is exfiltrated back to the C2 server.
- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the framework does not exfiltrate the collected data, which contradicts the information provided in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The 'yty' framework is designed to collect various types of data, including file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.
2. The framework communicates with a C2 server using a football-themed communication strategy.
3. The C2 server receives beacon messages containing system information, indicating an ongoing communication and data transfer.
4. Given the capabilities and the communication strategy, it is logical to conclude that the collected data is exfiltrated back to the C2 server.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
