### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components. The URL led to an IP-address-based URL where the archived payload was located, containing an executable file and a decoy PDF document.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and began sending commands immediately after the victim executed the downloader. The commands included taking screenshots, gathering system information, network scanning, and executing various system commands to collect data from the victim's computer.
   - **Persistence:** The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence, adding registry keys for a custom backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware deleted files after usage and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:** The operators used dumpers to target browsers and versions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016, retrieving databases related to credentials from software such as Firefox, The Bat! email client, and Opera.
   - **Discovery:** The operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment, including registry key enumeration, listing running processes, and using system commands to gather information about the victim.
   - **Command and Control:** The downloaders and backdoors communicated with the C&C server using commonly used ports 80 or 443. Data sent were hex-encoded and encrypted with AES or a custom algorithm.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were automatically prepared with all file paths to retrieve and sent to the C&C server. The data were hex-encoded and encrypted with a known algorithm or a custom one.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Sednit group's malware will scan for files matching specific extensions before preparing the staged data for exfiltration by creating a file containing paths of all files to be exfiltrated.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that the operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment, including registry key enumeration, listing running processes, and using system commands to gather information about the victim.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report states that data were automatically prepared with all file paths to retrieve and sent to the C&C server. This implies that the malware was capable of identifying and preparing files for exfiltration.
   - **File Scanning:** The report does not explicitly mention scanning for files matching specific extensions. However, the process of preparing all file paths for exfiltration suggests that the malware likely had a mechanism to identify and select files for exfiltration, which could include scanning for specific file extensions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase involved gathering detailed information about the victim's system, which is consistent with the need to identify files for exfiltration.
   - The exfiltration phase involved preparing all file paths to retrieve, which implies a systematic approach to identifying and selecting files.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the malware scanned for specific file extensions, the preparation of file paths for exfiltration strongly suggests that such a scanning process was likely part of the malware's functionality.
