### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The backdoor is used to inject additional modules into device memory.
- This enables the threat actors to extend their capabilities, perpetuate fraud, and install remote un-permissioned code.

**Persistence:**
- The Triada malware modifies a core process of the Android OS.
- It installs itself in every app on the device, including system functionality.
- It gains root access, making it a powerful tool for cybercriminals.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The backdoor connects to C2 servers on BADBOX-infected devices.
- New apps or code can be remotely installed without the device owner's permission.
- Threat actors can develop and deploy new schemes without user interaction.

**Credential Access:**
- Threat actors can create WhatsApp and Gmail accounts by stealing one-time passwords.
- This evades typical bot detection by making the accounts look like they were created by real people.

**Command and Control:**
- Infected devices connect to C2 servers immediately upon being turned on.
- The backdoor injects additional modules into device memory to extend capabilities and perpetuate fraud.
- The malware is periodically updated to ensure the device remains part of the botnet.

**Others:**
- BADBOX-infected devices are unsalvageable by average users due to the malware being on a read-only partition.
- Infected devices have been found on public school networks.
- HUMAN customers have been protected from PEACHPIT, the ad fraud component.
- The residential proxy module transforms devices into endpoints for a global residential proxy network.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities to infiltrate devices with firmware backdoors, is it likely that the BADBOX malware will use a backdoor connection to a command-and-control (C2) server before injecting additional modules into device memory to enable further capabilities?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Command and Control:** Infected devices connect to C2 servers immediately upon being turned on.
- **Execution:** The backdoor injects additional modules into device memory to extend capabilities and perpetuate fraud.

**Sequence Analysis:**
1. **Initial Infection:** The malware is installed via supply chain vulnerabilities.
2. **C2 Connection:** Infected devices connect to C2 servers immediately upon being turned on.
3. **Module Injection:** The backdoor injects additional modules into device memory to extend capabilities and perpetuate fraud.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that infected devices connect to C2 servers immediately upon being turned on.
- After establishing the C2 connection, the backdoor injects additional modules into device memory.
- This sequence aligns with the question's proposed order of events.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the first action after the device is turned on is to connect to the C2 server.
- Once the C2 connection is established, the backdoor injects additional modules into device memory.
- This sequence is consistent with the question's proposed order of events.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
