### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from government-related entities. The attachments used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor. The RTF files were weaponized using RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers created a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' to run the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, gathered data on the victim's computer, and encrypted and sent it to the C&C server. The loader decrypted and executed shellcode using dynamic API resolving.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, including screenshots, files, and system information.
   - **Impact:** The backdoor had the capability to shut down the victim's computer.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers' backdoor will collect screenshots as part of its extensive data collection capabilities before communicating the collected data with the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS details, user name, and MAC addresses.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report explicitly mentions that the backdoor was capable of exfiltrating data over the C&C channel, including screenshots, files, and system information.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not specify the exact order of data collection and exfiltration, but it is clear that the backdoor has the capability to collect and exfiltrate various types of data, including screenshots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor is designed to gather detailed information about the victim's system during the Discovery phase.
   - The backdoor is also capable of exfiltrating various types of data, including screenshots, as part of its Exfiltration phase.
   - Given the comprehensive nature of the data collection capabilities described in the report, it is reasonable to infer that the backdoor would collect screenshots as part of its data collection before communicating with the C&C server.
