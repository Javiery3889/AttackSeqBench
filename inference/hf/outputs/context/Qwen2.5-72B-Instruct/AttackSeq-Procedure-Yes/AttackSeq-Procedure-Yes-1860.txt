### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The QuasarRAT loader arrives as a 64-bit service DLL.
- It uses the CppHostCLR technique to decrypt, load, and invoke an embedded .NET assembly in-memory.
- The assembly is obfuscated with ConfuserEx and decrypts and executes a separate malicious .NET module stored in the %WINDOWS%\Microsoft.NET directory.
- The final payload assembly is stored as an encrypted file under the Microsoft.NET Framework directory and is decrypted and loaded in-memory as "Client."

**Persistence:**
- The QuasarRAT backdoor achieves persistence by installing the RAT as a service, known as DILLJUICE.
- The encrypted QuasarRAT payload is stored in the Microsoft.NET directory and is decrypted into memory and instantiated using a CLR host application.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The QuasarRAT loader uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.
- The payload and its immediate loader are .NET assemblies.
- The initial loader uses the CppHostCLR technique to inject and execute the .NET loader assembly.
- The payload is encrypted and stored under the Microsoft.NET directory.
- The .NET loader is obfuscated with ConfuserEx v1.0.0.
- Some samples of the loader are signed with a valid certificate from CONVENTION DIGITAL LTD, which is countersigned by Symantec.

**Others:**
- The MenuPass campaign targeted companies from several verticals across the EMEA region.
- QuasarRAT is a lightweight remote administration tool written in C#.
- It can collect system information, download and execute applications, upload files, log keystrokes, grab screenshots/camera captures, retrieve system passwords, and run shell commands.
- The threat actor modified the original QuasarRAT backdoor, adding their own field in the configuration and code for checking Internet connectivity.
- If a valid URL address is specified in the last value of the configuration, the malware will try to download the content of that URL and proceed with connecting to the C2 server only once the download is successful.
- The threat actor added a custom connectivity check to the backdoor.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection through techniques such as CppHostCLR and ConfuserEx, is it likely that QuasarRAT will communicate with a command and control (C2) server using AES-128 encrypted channels as specified in its configuration?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The report mentions that QuasarRAT uses several layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.
- It does not explicitly state the encryption method used for C2 communication.
- The report mentions that the threat actor added a custom connectivity check to the backdoor, which involves downloading content from a specified URL before connecting to the C2 server.

**Evaluation:**
- The report does not provide specific information about the encryption method used for C2 communication.
- However, given the sophisticated nature of the threat actor and the use of multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption, it is reasonable to assume that they would use a secure encryption method for C2 communication to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
- AES-128 is a widely used and secure encryption standard, making it a plausible choice for C2 communication.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report emphasizes the use of multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption to evade detection.
- The threat actor is sophisticated and likely to use secure communication methods.
- AES-128 is a common and secure encryption standard.
- While the report does not explicitly state the use of AES-128, the context and the nature of the threat actor suggest that they would use a secure encryption method for C2 communication.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
