### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious scripts executed by Earth Wendigo included cookie stealers and scripts that manipulated webmail session keys and browser cookies.
     - Exploited a webmail system's XSS vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript permanently.
     - Registered a malicious JavaScript code to the Service Worker feature in web browsers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Exploited an XSS vulnerability in the webmail system's shortcut feature to inject malicious code.
     - Registered a malicious JavaScript to the Service Worker script in the browser.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Hid malicious code inside CSS elements.
     - Leveraged the webmail system's search suggestion function to execute their script indirectly.
     - Manipulated email signatures.
     - Used Service Worker scripts to intercept and manipulate HTTPS requests.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Service Worker script intercepted HTTPS POST requests to the webmail login API to steal username and password pairs.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Established a WebSocket connection between the victims' browsers and their WebSocket server to control the JavaScript backdoor.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - JavaScript backdoor facilitated the exfiltration of mailbox content and attachments via a WebSocket connection to their server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Wendigo will maintain their foothold by:
     - Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in the shortcut feature to inject malicious code.
     - Registering malicious JavaScript as a Service Worker script in the browser.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The report confirms that Earth Wendigo executed malicious scripts to manipulate webmail session keys and exploited a webmail system's XSS vulnerability to inject JavaScript permanently.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report explicitly states that Earth Wendigo used two methods to maintain their foothold:
       - Exploiting an XSS vulnerability in the webmail system's shortcut feature to inject malicious code.
       - Registering a malicious JavaScript to the Service Worker script in the browser.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly outlines that Earth Wendigo used both methods mentioned in the question to maintain persistence.
   - The first method involves exploiting an XSS vulnerability in the webmail system's shortcut feature to inject malicious code.
   - The second method involves registering a malicious JavaScript to the Service Worker script in the browser.
   - Both of these methods are explicitly stated in the report under the Persistence section.
