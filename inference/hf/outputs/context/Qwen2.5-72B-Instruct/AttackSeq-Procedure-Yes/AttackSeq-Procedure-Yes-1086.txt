### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email. These documents contained job offers and activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution:** The Lazarus Group executed malicious code using system utilities and a backdoor named CommsCacher. They also used the Windows command line and the legitimate SQLite DLL library with a malicious exported function.
   - **Persistence:** The group created services using sc.exe, local administrator accounts, and placed shortcuts in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes and services.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files, hiding malware in hidden folders, and using rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Discovery:** The group collected information about users, network settings, and processes using system utilities like net user, adfind, tasklist.exe, and systeminfo.exe. They also used SMBMap to discover shared folders.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used compromised legitimate privileged accounts and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to C2 servers, which were disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will use system utilities like `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` to gather victim host information during reconnaissance before executing malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and leveraging the SQLite DLL library.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance (Discovery):** The CTI report mentions that the Lazarus Group used system utilities like `net user`, `adfind`, `tasklist.exe`, and `systeminfo.exe` to gather information about users, network settings, and processes. While `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` are not explicitly mentioned, they are common system utilities used for network and host information gathering.
   - **Execution:** The report states that the group executed malicious code using system utilities and the CommsCacher backdoor, leveraging the SQLite DLL library.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus Group's use of system utilities for reconnaissance is consistent with the information provided in the CTI report. While `ipconfig.exe` and `net.exe` are not explicitly mentioned, it is highly likely that they would use these tools as part of their reconnaissance activities, given their use of similar utilities.
   - The execution of malicious code using the CommsCacher backdoor and the SQLite DLL library is directly mentioned in the report.
