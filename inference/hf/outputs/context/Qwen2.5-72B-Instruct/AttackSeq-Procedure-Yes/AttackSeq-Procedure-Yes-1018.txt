### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Collection:** Searching for sensitive documents, scanning all drives, taking screenshots, and deploying scripts to scan for documents.
   - **Command and Control:** Using HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Uploading harvested documents to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Gamaredon is likely to leverage template injection to add remote templates to documents for defense evasion before using their backdoors to list interesting files for future exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that Gamaredon inserts malicious macros into existing documents to ensure persistence when they are reopened. This aligns with the first part of the question.
   - **Template Injection:** The report does not explicitly mention template injection. Template injection is a technique where a remote template is added to a document to execute malicious code when the document is opened. While this is a known technique, it is not specifically mentioned in the report.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files for future exfiltration. This aligns with the second part of the question.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs used by Gamaredon, including the use of malicious macros for persistence and the backdoor's capability to list interesting files.
   - While template injection is a plausible technique for defense evasion, it is not explicitly mentioned in the report. The report focuses on the use of malicious macros and other persistence mechanisms.
   - Given the information provided, it is more likely that Gamaredon would use the techniques mentioned in the report (malicious macros and backdoor file listing) rather than an unmentioned technique like template injection.
