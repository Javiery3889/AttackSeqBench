### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - These documents activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
     - The attackers used system utilities for reconnaissance and unknown PE files.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened the malicious documents.
     - The documents contained job offers and were named GD2020090939393903.doc and GD20200909GAB31.doc.
     - The attack vectors included LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Lazarus Group created services using the sc.exe utility and local administrator accounts.
     - They placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The group created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes and services.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The group used various techniques to evade detection, including encrypting configuration files with the VEST algorithm, hiding malware in hidden folders, and removing malware samples from the file system.
     - They used rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The group collected information about users, network settings, and processes using system utilities.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware used the standard HTTP protocol to connect to the C2 servers, which were disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Lazarus Group is likely to execute malicious code and leverage the SQLite DLL before maintaining persistence by creating services using sc.exe utility and placing shortcuts in the startup folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access was achieved through malicious documents containing job offers, which activated macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution of Malicious Code:**
     - The report mentions the use of rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL, which is a form of executing malicious code.
   - **Leveraging SQLite DLL:**
     - The report does not mention the use of SQLite DLL specifically.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report clearly states that the Lazarus Group created services using the sc.exe utility and placed shortcuts in the startup folder for persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report confirms that the Lazarus Group executed malicious code (using rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL) after gaining initial access.
   - However, the report does not mention the use of SQLite DLL.
   - The report does confirm that the group maintained persistence by creating services using sc.exe and placing shortcuts in the startup folder.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report, the Lazarus Group did execute malicious code (using rundll32.exe to launch a malicious DLL) but there is no mention of leveraging the SQLite DLL. Therefore, the sequence described in the question is not fully supported by the report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
