### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The skip-2.0 backdoor is launched via a VMProtected launcher.
     - The backdoor is executed with the SessionEnv service.
     - DLL hijacking is used for persistence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor achieves persistence by exploiting a DLL hijacking vulnerability.
     - The DLL is installed at C:\Windows\System32\TSVIPSrv.DLL.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Inner-Loader component lists running processes to find the process running MSSQL Server.
   - **Impact:**
     - The backdoor allows unauthorized access to MSSQL databases.
     - It manipulates event logging and stored data, potentially impacting data integrity.
   - **Others:**
     - The backdoor shares similarities with PortReuse and ShadowPad, using the same custom packer and VMProtected launcher.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the skip-2.0 backdoor is likely to employ a VMProtected launcher for defense evasion after achieving execution and persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:**
     - The report clearly states that the skip-2.0 backdoor is launched via a VMProtected launcher.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor achieves persistence through DLL hijacking.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor shares similarities with PortReuse and ShadowPad, which use the same custom packer and VMProtected launcher.
     - The use of a VMProtected launcher is a technique for defense evasion, as it can obfuscate the payload and make it harder to detect.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the skip-2.0 backdoor is launched via a VMProtected launcher.
   - The VMProtected launcher is used for initial execution and is associated with defense evasion techniques.
   - The backdoor's similarity to other known backdoors (PortReuse and ShadowPad) that use the same custom packer and VMProtected launcher further supports the use of the VMProtected launcher for defense evasion.
