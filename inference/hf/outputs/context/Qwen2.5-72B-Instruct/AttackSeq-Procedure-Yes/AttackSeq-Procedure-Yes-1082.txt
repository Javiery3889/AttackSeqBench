### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - System utilities and unknown PE files were used for reconnaissance.
     - The backdoor named CommsCacher and its configuration file encrypted with the VEST algorithm were used to monitor RDP sessions.
     - The attackers attempted to connect to the domain forecareer[.]com, which mimicked the official website of General Dynamics Mission Systems.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved through malicious documents sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
     - The documents activated malicious macros on the victims' home computers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed using system utilities and the backdoor CommsCacher.
     - The Windows command line and the SQLite DLL library were used for execution.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Services were created using sc.exe and local administrator accounts.
     - Shortcuts were placed in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Local administrator accounts were created and system processes and services were manipulated.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files were encrypted with the VEST algorithm.
     - Malware was hidden in hidden folders and removed from the file system.
     - rundll32.exe was used to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Information about users, network settings, and processes was collected using system utilities and SMBMap.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Compromised legitimate privileged accounts were used to move laterally.
     - Data encryption algorithms were used to communicate with C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus Group's malware will use the HTTP protocol to communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains located in various countries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The attackers used a domain that mimicked a legitimate website (forecareer[.]com) for initial access.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The group used compromised privileged accounts and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report mentions the use of a backdoor named CommsCacher and the VEST algorithm for encryption.
     - The use of a mimicked domain (forecareer[.]com) suggests that the group is capable of using legitimate-looking domains for their C2 infrastructure.
   - **HTTP Protocol:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state the use of the HTTP protocol, it is a common method for C2 communication due to its ability to blend in with normal web traffic and evade detection.
   - **Legitimate Domains:**
     - The use of a mimicked domain (forecareer[.]com) indicates that the group may use legitimate-looking domains to host their C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Lazarus Group has a history of using sophisticated TTPs, including the use of mimicked domains and encryption.
   - The use of a mimicked domain (forecareer[.]com) suggests that they are capable of using legitimate-looking domains for their C2 infrastructure.
   - The HTTP protocol is a common and effective method for C2 communication, especially when trying to blend in with normal web traffic.
   - Given the group's capabilities and the nature of their attack, it is plausible that they would use the HTTP protocol to communicate with C2 servers hosted on legitimate domains.
