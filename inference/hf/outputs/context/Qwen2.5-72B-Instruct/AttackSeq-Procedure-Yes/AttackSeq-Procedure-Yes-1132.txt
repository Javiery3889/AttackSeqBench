### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT34 used a malicious Microsoft Word document titled 'Job-Details.doc' delivered via LinkedIn messages.
- The document contained embedded malicious macros.

**Execution:**
- The macros verified a mouse connection (anti-sandboxing).
- The macros fingerprinted the target device.
- The macros communicated with the C2 server.
- The macros dropped an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension (later renamed to '.exe').
- The macros registered a Windows scheduled task to launch the executable periodically.

**Persistence:**
- Persistence was established through a scheduled task named 'SystemFailureReporter' set to execute the second stage payload, SideTwist, every 5 minutes.

**Command and Control:**
- The SideTwist backdoor communicated with the C&C server (sarmsoftware[.]com) using HTTP on port 443, with port 80 as a fallback.
- The backdoor used different techniques for outgoing and incoming communications, both encrypted using the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.
- Commands were received from the server by searching for specific patterns hidden inside the HTML content of a legitimate-looking website, in this case, a fake Flickr page.

**Others:**
- APT34 has a history of targeting individuals with job opportunity documents.
- The campaign involved another APT34 tool, a .NET-based backdoor named Karkoff, which used internet-facing exchange servers for communication.
- The Lebanese Government's exchange server credentials were found within the Karkoff implant, suggesting a potential long-term compromise.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Before APT34's campaign utilized DNS tunneling for evasion by employing the requestbin.net DNS tunneling service, is it likely that the malicious macros within the Word document executed actions such as verifying a mouse connection for anti-sandboxing, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malicious macros verified a mouse connection (anti-sandboxing).
- The macros communicated with the C2 server.
- The macros dropped an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension (later renamed to '.exe').

**Contextual Information:**
- The report does not mention DNS tunneling or the use of requestbin.net.
- The report focuses on the use of HTTP for C2 communication and the use of a fake Flickr page for command reception.

**Evaluation:**
- The actions described in the question (verifying a mouse connection, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable) are explicitly mentioned in the CTI report.
- The report does not mention DNS tunneling or requestbin.net, but this does not contradict the actions described in the question.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the malicious macros performed the actions of verifying a mouse connection, communicating with the C2 server, and dropping an embedded executable with a '.doc' extension.
- The report does not mention DNS tunneling or requestbin.net, but this does not affect the likelihood of the actions described in the question.
- The actions described in the question are consistent with the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
