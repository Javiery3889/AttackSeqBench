### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Logged into a public-facing system via SSH using a local account.
- Used port forwarding to establish an RDP session to internal servers.
- Used VPNs to gain access and persist in the environment.
- Exported saved passwords from Chrome browser installations.

**Persistence:**
- Used credential hopping.
- Leveraged accounts with Delegated Administrator rights.
- Configured TrailBlazer malware for WMI persistence.
- Configured GoldMax malware for persistence via a crontab entry.
- Added credentials to O365 Service Principals and created new ones.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Stole browser cookies to bypass MFA.
- Renamed utilities to masquerade as legitimate system binaries.
- Renamed systems to match the victim's naming convention.

**Credential Access:**
- Stole web session cookies to access cloud resources.
- Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP.
- Used compromised service principals to make changes to the Office 365 environment.

**Discovery:**
- Used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify Active Directory information.
- Regularly interrogated other systems using tasklist.exe.
- Probed external services to regain access.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment after performing discovery activities using AdFind and custom PowerShell cmdlets to identify Active Directory information.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Discovery Activities:**
  - The report clearly states that the threat actor used AdFind, PowerShell cmdlets, and custom tooling to identify Active Directory information.
  
- **Lateral Movement:**
  - The report also explicitly mentions that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP throughout the environment.

Given that the discovery activities and the use of both types of accounts for RDP are both clearly documented in the report, it is highly likely that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP to move laterally through the environment after performing discovery activities.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms that the threat actor used AdFind and PowerShell cmdlets for discovery.
- The report also confirms that the threat actor used both privileged and non-privileged accounts for RDP for lateral movement.
- The sequence of activities (discovery followed by lateral movement) is consistent with the report.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
