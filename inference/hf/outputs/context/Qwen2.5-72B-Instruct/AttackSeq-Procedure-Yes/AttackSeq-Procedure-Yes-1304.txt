### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882, leading to silent code execution (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attack used T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens using T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry).
   - **Command and Control:** Stolen credentials were sent to a C2 server using T1043 (Commonly Used Port) and T1071 (Standard Application Layer Protocol).
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002 - Data Encrypted).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after exploiting CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution, the threat actor will proceed to collect data from the local system after employing defense evasion techniques such as software packing and deletion of the original file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882:** The report confirms that the Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 for silent code execution (T1204).
   - **Defense Evasion Techniques:** The report mentions the use of T1107 (File Deletion), T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories), and T1045 (Software Packing).
   - **Data Collection:** The report indicates that the dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens (T1003, T1081, T1214), which is a form of data collection from the local system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence in the CTI report shows that after the initial exploitation (T1204), the threat actor employed defense evasion techniques (T1107, T1158, T1045).
   - Following these defense evasion techniques, the threat actor proceeded to collect data from the local system by searching for stored passwords and access tokens (T1003, T1081, T1214).
