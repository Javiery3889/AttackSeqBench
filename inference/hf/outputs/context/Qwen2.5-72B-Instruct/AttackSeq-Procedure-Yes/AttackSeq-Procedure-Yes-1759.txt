### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email.
- The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

**Execution:**
- Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- On July 16, additional variants of Pterodo were executed.
- On July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload for the attack.

**Persistence:**
- Shuckworm established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes.
- These tasks ensured that their backdoor would remain active even after system reboots.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Shuckworm utilized mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
- They used scheduled tasks and VBS scripts to evade detection and maintain their foothold.

**Collection:**
- Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.
- It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has been tracking Shuckworm's activities.
- Shuckworm has been active since at least 2013 and has increased the sophistication of their attacks.
- They use living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally.
- Seven files used by Shuckworm were identified, including VBS files, a VNC client, and a Process Explorer binary.
- IOCs showed patterns such as C&C IPs and malicious files in specific directories.
- The SSU reported over 5,000 attacks by Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, is Shuckworm likely to download additional payloads before using these payloads to maintain control over compromised systems during their cyber espionage activities?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Shuckworm used a custom backdoor (Pterodo) and executed various VBS scripts and HTA files.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- On July 28, a VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload.
- They used mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions and browser security settings.
- They deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.

**Reasoning:**
- The report indicates that Shuckworm used a backdoor (Pterodo) and VBS scripts to maintain their presence and execute commands.
- They also installed a VNC client as a payload to maintain control over the compromised systems.
- The use of HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers is a common tactic for downloading additional payloads.
- The report mentions the deployment of multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and the installation of a VNC client, suggesting that they likely download additional payloads to maintain control.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**

Shuckworm is likely to download additional payloads after utilizing HTTP requests to communicate with their C&C servers, as evidenced by the installation of the VNC client and the deployment of multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor.
