### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, using advanced reconnaissance to know victims' whereabouts.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and P2P sharing sites.
   - **Execution:** They deploy malware components like downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Collection:** They collect secrets from local systems, including cached passwords and credentials from browsers and email services.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use sophisticated capabilities like signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files for defense evasion before targeting stored secrets in browsers and email services for credential access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The report states that the Darkhotel APT deploys various malware components, including downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that they use digital certificates to sign their backdoors and encrypt gathered data in log files.
   - **Collection:** The report indicates that they collect various secrets stored on local systems, including cached passwords and credentials from multiple browsers and email services.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report. After deploying malware components during execution, the Darkhotel APT uses sophisticated defense evasion techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates and encrypting gathered data in log files. This is followed by the collection of stored secrets from browsers and email services.
   - The report clearly states that these steps are part of their attack methodology, indicating a logical and sequential approach to their operations.
