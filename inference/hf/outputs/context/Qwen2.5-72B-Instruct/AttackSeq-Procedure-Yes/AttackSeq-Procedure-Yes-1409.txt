### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers targeted Instagram users, particularly influencers.
- They impersonated technical support or friends of the victims.
- They used phishing emails, Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram to deliver messages.
- These messages contained generic greetings and claimed copyright violations or offered verified badges to lure victims into providing their credentials on phishing sites that mimicked Instagram's interface.

**Credential Access:**
- The attackers used phishing sites to collect victims' Instagram usernames, passwords, and associated email credentials.
- After obtaining these details, they changed the account passwords, effectively locking out the original owners.
- They also downloaded all images and messages from the accounts, either manually or through Instagram's data backup feature.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After collecting victims' Instagram credentials through phishing sites, is it likely that the attackers will demand ransom payments for the return of compromised accounts after locking out the original owners by changing the passwords?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used phishing to gain access to Instagram accounts.
- They changed the passwords to lock out the original owners.
- They downloaded all images and messages from the accounts.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report does not mention any ransom demands or financial extortion.
- The primary goal seems to be gaining access to the accounts and their content, possibly for further malicious activities or to use the accounts themselves.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This would imply that the attackers are primarily motivated by financial gain through ransom.
  - However, the report does not provide any evidence of ransom demands or financial extortion.
- **B: No**
  - This aligns with the information provided in the report.
  - The attackers' actions (changing passwords and downloading content) suggest they are more interested in gaining control of the accounts and their data rather than demanding ransom.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report focuses on the methods used to gain access to the accounts and the actions taken after gaining access (changing passwords and downloading content).
- There is no mention of ransom demands or financial extortion.
- The primary goal appears to be control and data exfiltration rather than financial gain through ransom.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
