### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, delivered through an email attachment.
     - The zip file contains a file disguised as a Microsoft Word document icon, which is actually an application bundle containing executable code.
     - When the user attempts to open the decoy Word document, the Trojan executes and displays a decoy document to mask its execution.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor opens a hidden file named .CFUserEncoding from the application bundle's Resources folder.
     - It copies this file to the executable path, replacing the application bundle after persistence is established.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim's host starts up.
     - It copies itself to a location and filename based on the user's UID, using a segmented MD5 hash as a directory in ~/Library/OpenSSL/ or /Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs for root users.
     - The malware then deletes the original application bundle, leaving the decoy document, and launches itself as a service from the new location.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor avoids the use of command line utilities and suspicious strings.
     - It employs a robust string encoding mechanism to obfuscate its functions.
     - The malware uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor surveys the victim's computer and sends the information back to the server.
     - It gathers details such as the victim's name, machine serial number, and system information, which is then encrypted and sent to the command and control server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after achieving persistence by creating a Launch Agent and launching itself as a service from a new location, the backdoor is likely to gather system details and send the information back to its command and control server using a custom binary protocol with session-based ephemeral keys.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report clearly states that the backdoor creates a Launch Agent and launches itself as a service from a new location.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report also states that the backdoor gathers system details and sends the information back to the command and control server.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the backdoor uses a custom binary protocol with encryption to communicate with its command and control server.
   - **Session-based Ephemeral Keys:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of session-based ephemeral keys, but it does mention the use of a custom binary protocol with encryption, which is a strong indication of advanced encryption techniques.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor achieves persistence by creating a Launch Agent and launching itself as a service from a new location.
   - After achieving persistence, the backdoor gathers system details and sends the information back to the command and control server.
   - The communication with the command and control server is done using a custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention session-based ephemeral keys, the use of a custom binary protocol with encryption suggests advanced encryption techniques, which could include session-based ephemeral keys.
