### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, opening a decoy file, and running the downloader executable.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks, use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, enumerating processes, gathering browser data, and keylogger information.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication, implementing fallback channels, downloading additional files, and using FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to automatically exfiltrate all collected files to remote servers and the C&C server using encrypted and compressed transmission methods after stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging encrypted data in a temporary folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder where files and logs are encrypted.
   - **Command and Control:** The report mentions that Machete uses FTP and HTTP for communication with C&C servers and implements fallback channels. It also states that the malware can download additional files for execution on the victim's machine and uses FTP and HTTP for C&C communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report does not explicitly state that the exfiltration of collected files is automatic or that it uses encrypted and compressed transmission methods. However, it does mention that the data is encrypted before being staged in a temporary folder, which suggests a level of security in the exfiltration process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that Machete uses encrypted and compressed methods to stage data in a temporary folder, which is a strong indicator that the exfiltration process is also likely to be secure.
   - The use of FTP and HTTP for C&C communication suggests that the exfiltration of data is a part of the communication process.
   - The report does not explicitly state that the exfiltration is automatic, but given the sophistication of the malware and the need to maintain stealth, it is reasonable to infer that the exfiltration process is automated.
