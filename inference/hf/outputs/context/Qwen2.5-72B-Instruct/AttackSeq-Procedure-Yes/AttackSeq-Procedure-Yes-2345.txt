### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT targets NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia using phishing lures.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops its own remote access tools and uses publicly available tools like PlugX, Cobalt Strike, ORat, and RCSession.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession are used for execution.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Native tools like vssadmin are used to create volume shadow copies and retrieve NTDS.dit files.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Steps are taken to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Credentials are collected from high-privilege accounts and password hashes from NTDS.dit files.
   - **Discovery:** Tools like Nmap, Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands are used to understand the network environment.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Wmiexec and net commands are used to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** Custom batch scripts are used to collect files from specific locations.
   - **Exfiltration:** Tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike are used to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT will use ORat with a raw socket protocol for Command and Control (C2) communication after using scripts to collect files during the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report mentions that BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts to collect files from specific locations.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report lists the tools used by BRONZE PRESIDENT, including ORat, but does not specify the communication protocols used by ORat.
   - **Common Practices:** Typically, advanced threat actors like BRONZE PRESIDENT use a variety of C2 protocols to avoid detection. Raw socket protocols are less common and more likely to be detected by network security systems.
   - **Contextual Information:** The group is known for using tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession, which are more sophisticated and less likely to use raw socket protocols.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The group uses custom batch scripts to collect files, which aligns with the report.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not explicitly state that ORat uses raw socket protocols. Given the group's sophistication and the use of more advanced tools like Cobalt Strike and RCSession, it is less likely that they would use a less sophisticated and more detectable method like raw socket protocols.
   - **Common Practices:** Advanced threat actors typically use more sophisticated and stealthy C2 methods to avoid detection.
