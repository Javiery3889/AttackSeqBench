### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Discovery:** The discovery phase involved profiling the computer using commands like whoami, net user, and net group, and using PowerView to search for computer objects in the Active Directory.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.
   - **Impact:** The end goal was to deploy WastedLocker ransomware, leading to significant disruption and ransom demands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Cobalt Strike will be used to empty log files to aid in concealing the attackers' activities before employing lateral movement through commands and process injection on remote computers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that the attackers used commands like whoami, net user, and net group to profile the computer.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the attackers used PsExec to manage Windows Defender and stop services, but it does not explicitly state that they emptied log files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the emptying of log files, it is a common technique used in defense evasion to conceal the attackers' activities. Given the sophistication of the attack and the use of advanced tools like Cobalt Strike, it is highly likely that the attackers would take steps to cover their tracks, including emptying log files.
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the question (emptying log files before lateral movement) aligns with the overall goal of the attackers to remain undetected and maintain control over the network.
