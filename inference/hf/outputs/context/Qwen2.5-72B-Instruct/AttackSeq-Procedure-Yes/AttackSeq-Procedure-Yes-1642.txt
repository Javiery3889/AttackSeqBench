### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Achieved through PowerShell commands.
- Downloaded malicious payloads from URLs hosted on compromised servers.
- Servers were part of the PurpleFox botnet and mostly located in China.

**Execution:**
- PowerShell commands initiated the download of a malicious payload.
- The payload included a script targeting 64-bit systems.
- The script checked the Windows version and applied hotfixes for specific vulnerabilities.
- Used PowerSploit to reflectively load an exploit bundle binary.
- Used the Tater module as a failover to install the MSI package as an admin.

**Persistence:**
- The MSI package installed by PurpleFox ensured persistence.
- Removed old PurpleFox installations from the registry.
- Installed components of the PurpleFox backdoor into the Windows directory.
- Modified registry values to allow file rename operations upon system restart.
- Replaced sens.dll with the malware to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).

**Command and Control:**
- The new .NET backdoor, FoxSocket, used WebSockets for a robust and secure C&C channel.
- Maintained an open WebSocket connection by sending keepalive messages.
- Exchanged bidirectional messages to negotiate a session encryption key.
- C&C infrastructure included several active servers and domains.

**Others:**
- Trend Micro Vision One flagged suspicious PowerShell commands.
- The backdoor utilized WebSocket communication for a bidirectional channel.
- Backdoor capabilities included key negotiations, machine fingerprinting, and command execution.
- Trend Micro Managed XDR service offers expert threat monitoring and analysis.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After ensuring persistence by replacing sens.dll with the PurpleFox backdoor to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS), is it likely that PurpleFox will install a rootkit driver to evade detection by hiding its files and processes while also executing a .vbs script to create a firewall rule blocking ports 135, 139, and 445?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Persistence Mechanism:**
- The report clearly states that PurpleFox ensured persistence by replacing sens.dll with the malware to run as the System Event Notification Service (SENS).

**Rootkit Driver:**
- The report does not mention the installation of a rootkit driver to evade detection by hiding files and processes. While rootkits are a common technique for evading detection, the report does not provide any evidence that PurpleFox used this specific method.

**Firewall Rule:**
- The report does not mention the execution of a .vbs script to create a firewall rule blocking ports 135, 139, and 445. These ports are commonly associated with Windows networking services (e.g., RPC, NetBIOS, and SMB), and blocking them could disrupt normal system operations, which is not a typical behavior for a stealthy backdoor.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The report provides detailed information about the initial access, execution, persistence, and command and control mechanisms used by PurpleFox.
- The report does not mention the installation of a rootkit driver or the creation of a firewall rule to block specific ports.
- Given the information provided, it is unlikely that PurpleFox would take these additional steps, as they are not mentioned in the report and would be unusual for the described attack sequence.

**Final Answer: B: No**
