### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 identified targets.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom in-memory malware framework (NodeIISWeb) and removed disk-resident tools for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and removed tools after use.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory for reconnaissance.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 would use exploits to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement before establishing command and control with an inline hook on the IIS request validation function.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance, which were loaded directly into memory and then deleted to avoid detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention lateral movement to additional IIS servers. However, it is common for threat actors to move laterally after reconnaissance to expand their foothold.
   - **Command and Control:** The report clearly states that TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on the IIS request handling process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:** TG1021 used sophisticated tools for reconnaissance and discovery, indicating a thorough and methodical approach.
   - **Lateral Movement:** While the report does not explicitly state lateral movement, it is a logical next step after reconnaissance to expand the attack surface.
   - **Command and Control:** The establishment of C2 is a critical step in maintaining control over the compromised network. The inline hook on the IIS request handling process is a sophisticated method to achieve this.

Given the sophisticated nature of TG1021's operations and the logical progression of attack stages, it is plausible that the threat actor would use exploits to compromise additional IIS servers for lateral movement before establishing command and control.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
