### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events.
   - **Persistence:** Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and file system path changes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, such as API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and virtual environment detection.
   - **Credential Access:** It steals credentials from Google Chrome and Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** It communicates with the C2 server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro is likely to discover system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **System Information Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention that Grandoreiro discovers system information such as the operating system version before communicating with the C2 server.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report states that Grandoreiro communicates with the C2 server using the RealThinClient SDK, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds. The first command received from the C2 server is a list of all currently connected victims, including collected information about their machines.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide explicit information about Grandoreiro discovering system information before communicating with the C2 server. However, it is common for malware to gather system information before or during the initial communication with the C2 server to provide context to the attackers.
   - The C2 communication process described in the report suggests that the malware is capable of collecting and transmitting system information, but it does not specify the exact timing of this information gathering.
   - Given the sophistication of Grandoreiro and its focus on evading detection and maintaining persistence, it is plausible that the malware would gather system information as part of its initial operations, even if not explicitly stated in the report.
