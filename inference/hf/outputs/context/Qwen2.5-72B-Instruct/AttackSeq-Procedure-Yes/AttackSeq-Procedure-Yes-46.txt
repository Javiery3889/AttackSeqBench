### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign involved phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - The emails were designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Execution:**
     - Upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute.
     - The macro would call a shape box in the document to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
     - This script would download and execute payloads associated with both Ursnif and GandCrab malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The PowerShell script operated in memory to avoid detection.
     - It used the .Net Webclient class to download payloads and the DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute the downloaded files without saving them to disk.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The PowerShell script communicated with hardcoded C2 servers to request and download the payloads.
     - It used the DownloadString method to contact the C2 server and the DownloadData method to download a resource from a second C2 server.
   - **Impact:**
     - The payloads were GandCrab ransomware and Ursnif malware.
     - GandCrab would encrypt files, and Ursnif would perform credential harvesting and gather system and process information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the campaign involves phishing emails with attached Word documents containing embedded macros.
   - The report specifies that upon opening the malicious Word document, a VBS macro would execute.
   - The document name 'Richard_Johnson.doc' is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but the general pattern of using a malicious Word document with embedded macros is consistent with the described attack.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report confirms that the initial access is gained through phishing emails.
   - These emails contain Word documents with embedded macros.
   - When the Word document is opened, the VBS macro is executed.
   - The macro then retrieves and runs an encoded PowerShell script, which downloads and executes the payloads.

### Final Answer
Given the detailed description in the CTI report, it is highly likely that the observed campaign involving phishing emails will execute VBS macros from the embedded Microsoft Word document after gaining initial access through phishing emails containing the malicious 'Richard_Johnson.doc' file.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
