### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for remote access.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 uses tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure and credentials to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives using compression tools and remote command execution scripts.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to use dynamic-DNS domains for command and control infrastructure by employing tools like Robocopy and Putty Secure Copy Client (PSCP) after staging data for exfiltration.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Dynamic-DNS Domains:** The CTI report mentions that APT10 has significantly increased the number of dynamic-DNS domains used for operations. This suggests that dynamic-DNS domains are a part of their C2 infrastructure.
   - **Tools for Exfiltration:** The report does not specifically mention the use of Robocopy or PSCP for exfiltration. Instead, it describes the use of multi-part archives and remote command execution scripts for staging data.
   - **Exfiltration Method:** The report states that APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers. This method aligns with the use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - APT10's use of dynamic-DNS domains for C2 infrastructure is well-documented in the report.
   - The report does not explicitly mention Robocopy or PSCP, but it does describe the use of remote command execution scripts for data staging, which could be used in conjunction with other tools for exfiltration.
   - The exfiltration method described (pushing data to other networks and pulling it to C2 servers) is consistent with the use of dynamic-DNS domains.
