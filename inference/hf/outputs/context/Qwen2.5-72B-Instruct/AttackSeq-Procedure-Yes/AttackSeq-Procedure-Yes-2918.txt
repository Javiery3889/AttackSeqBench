### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT41 conducts reconnaissance activities, targeting call record information and hotel reservation systems.
   - **Initial Access:** APT41 uses spear-phishing emails with .chm files to initially compromise victim organizations.
   - **Execution:** APT41 deploys various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.
   - **Persistence:** APT41 deploys rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence, with bootkits adding stealth by executing before the operating system initializes.
   - **Credential Access:** APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT41 moves laterally within networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, to discover and access game production environments.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT41 moves laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until accessing game production environments.
   - **Collection:** APT41 collects source code and digital certificates from game production environments.
   - **Impact:** APT41 manipulates virtual currencies and has attempted to deploy ransomware in the video game industry for financial gain.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT41 is likely to deploy MBR bootkits to maintain persistence and use bootkits for pre-operating system execution as an added layer of stealth before leveraging malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Stealth:** The CTI report clearly states that APT41 deploys rootkits and MBR bootkits to maintain persistence and that bootkits add stealth by executing before the operating system initializes.
   - **Credential Access:** The report also mentions that APT41 uses malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order in which these actions are performed. However, it is logical to assume that APT41 would first establish persistence and stealth before moving on to credential access to ensure they have a secure foothold in the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT41 gains initial access through spear-phishing emails with .chm files.
   - **Execution:** Once inside, they deploy various malware, including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.
   - **Persistence:** To maintain long-term access, they deploy rootkits and MBR bootkits, which provide stealth by executing before the operating system initializes.
   - **Credential Access:** After establishing persistence and stealth, they use credential stealers and keyloggers to access credentials.
   - **Discovery and Lateral Movement:** They then move laterally within the network to discover and access game production environments.
   - **Collection and Impact:** Finally, they collect sensitive data and manipulate virtual currencies or deploy ransomware.

### Final Answer
Given the logical sequence of actions and the emphasis on stealth and persistence in the CTI report, it is likely that APT41 will deploy MBR bootkits to maintain persistence and use bootkits for pre-operating system execution as an added layer of stealth before leveraging malware such as credential stealers and keyloggers to access compromised systems.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
