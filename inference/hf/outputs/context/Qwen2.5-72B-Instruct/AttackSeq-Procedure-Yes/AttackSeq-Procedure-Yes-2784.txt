### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after the iOS malware collects information during the Discovery phase, it is likely that the app will:
- Send the gathered information
- Write log messages
- Use a token for communication
- Upload files

During the Command and Control (C2) phase.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
- **Discovery:** The malware collects information from the victim's device.
- **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with the attacker's server to send collected data, receive commands, and maintain control.

**CTI Report Context:**
- The report describes the malware's ability to collect various types of information (Discovery phase).
- However, the report does not explicitly mention the C2 phase activities such as sending gathered information, writing log messages, using tokens, or uploading files.

**Logical Inference:**
- Given that the malware is designed to collect sensitive information, it is highly likely that it will need to exfiltrate this data to the attacker's server.
- Writing log messages and using tokens for communication are common practices in C2 operations to ensure secure and reliable communication.
- Uploading files is a typical method for exfiltrating collected data.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The malware's primary purpose is to collect and exfiltrate data.
- The C2 phase is essential for the malware to send the collected information back to the attacker.
- Writing log messages and using tokens for communication are standard practices in C2 operations to maintain stealth and security.
- Uploading files is a common method for data exfiltration.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
