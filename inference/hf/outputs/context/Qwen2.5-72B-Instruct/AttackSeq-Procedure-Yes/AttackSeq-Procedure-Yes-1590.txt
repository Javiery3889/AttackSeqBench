### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641.
     - Initial shellcode stage located and executed a secondary shellcode stub.
     - Secondary shellcode stub decrypted and executed an embedded payload.
     - Payload created a temporary file in the %TEMP% folder and executed it using WinExec.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll.
     - hccutils.dll performed security product checks and initiated the next stage of execution.
     - Malware used three techniques for persistence.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Modified registry keys to ensure malicious DLLs run after reboot or with every user mode process.
     - Injected ResN32.dll into explorer.exe for persistent execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Customized installation to avoid 24 identified security products.
     - Used multi-stage installation with checks to detect analysis by security researchers.
     - Created mutexes and named events to ensure only one instance was running.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
     - Sent encrypted traffic including a beacon and collected information.
     - Supported proxy usage for victims behind web proxies.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.
     - Compressed, encrypted, and stored data in specific directories or sent to the C2 server.
     - Logged file and directory operations, clipboard data, and encrypted network traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if T9000, after evading detection, is likely to target Skype users and automatically capture data from removable media and steal sensitive files before exfiltrating this data to the C2 server through compressed and encrypted network traffic.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report states that T9000 customized its installation to avoid 24 identified security products and used multi-stage installation with checks to detect analysis by security researchers.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report explicitly mentions that T9000 exfiltrated various types of data, including Skype communications and files from removable drives.
     - Data was compressed, encrypted, and stored in specific directories or sent to the C2 server.
     - The malware logged file and directory operations, clipboard data, and encrypted network traffic.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - T9000 is designed to evade detection by customizing its installation and using multi-stage checks.
   - **Targeting Skype Users:**
     - The report clearly states that T9000 exfiltrated Skype communications.
   - **Capturing Data from Removable Media:**
     - The report mentions that T9000 exfiltrated files from removable drives.
   - **Stealing Sensitive Files:**
     - The report indicates that T9000 collected and exfiltrated sensitive information, including file and directory operations and clipboard data.
   - **Exfiltration Method:**
     - The report specifies that the data was compressed, encrypted, and sent to the C2 server.
