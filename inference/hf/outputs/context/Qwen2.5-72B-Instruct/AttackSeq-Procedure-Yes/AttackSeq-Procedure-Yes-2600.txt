### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros.
- The macros executed an embedded JScript file when enabled.

**Execution:**
- The VBA macro decodes and runs, writing JScript data to '%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js' and executing it.
- A decoy XLS file is saved and loaded to maintain the appearance of legitimacy.
- A VBScript file is created to delete the original file.
- The network.js file modifies the '%regrun%' registry to ensure autostart.

**Persistence:**
- NanHaiShu modifies the '%regrun%' registry entry to point to the network.js file.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation to hide the decoy XLS and JScript file.
- The URL string in the JScript code is obfuscated in two layers.

**Discovery:**
- NanHaiShu gathers system information (Volume Serial Number, IP Address, Computer Name, User Name, Operating System, Proxy Server) and uploads it to the C&C server.

**Exfiltration:**
- The malware can receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for data exfiltration.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After NanHaiShu gathers system information from infected machines, such as IP Address, Volume Serial Number, and Computer Name, is it likely to communicate with C&C servers using HTTP POST and HTTP GET before downloading and executing JScript and VBScript code?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Discovery:** NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
- **Exfiltration:** The malware can receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code for data exfiltration.

**Reasoning:**
- The report states that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. This implies communication with the C&C server.
- The report also mentions that the malware can receive and execute additional JScript and VBScript code, which suggests that it communicates with the C&C server to download and execute these scripts.
- HTTP POST and HTTP GET are common methods for C&C communication in malware.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the report's description of the malware's behavior. It gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server, and it can receive and execute additional scripts, which likely involves communication with the C&C server using HTTP POST and HTTP GET.
- **B: No** - This does not align with the report's description. The report clearly indicates that the malware communicates with the C&C server to upload system information and receive additional scripts.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
