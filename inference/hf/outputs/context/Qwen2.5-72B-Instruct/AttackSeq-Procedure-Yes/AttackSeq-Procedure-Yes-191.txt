### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** It persists by replacing the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes files containing credentials and uses tcpdump to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** It enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Collection:** It collects files based on predefined file extensions and from application and data directories.
   - **Command and Control:** It provides SCP functionality, deploys a Tor hidden service, and provides a local Socks connection for db, which includes SSH server and client capabilities.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate netd, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the netd component will exfiltrate the collected files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections after the Collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that Infamous Chisel's netd component collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The report mentions that the malware provides SCP functionality and deploys a Tor hidden service relaying connections to an SSH program. It also provides a local Socks connection for db, and db provides a SSH server and client.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** While the report does not explicitly mention an "Exfiltration" phase, the Command and Control capabilities (SCP, Tor hidden service, SSH) strongly suggest that the collected files can be exfiltrated using these methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Collection:** The netd component collects files from the local system.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware has the capability to use SCP, Tor hidden services, and SSH for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Given the Command and Control capabilities, it is highly likely that the collected files can be exfiltrated using these methods.
