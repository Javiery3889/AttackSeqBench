### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish, a malicious JavaScript-based framework, to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites. Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update. This led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
   - **Execution:** The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector taken from an open-source project called Donut. This was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload, capable of command execution, process injection, privilege escalation, and file upload/download.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using a publicly documented technique involving the Software Licensing User Interface tool (slui.exe). The attackers also used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** To deploy the ransomware, the attackers used PsExec to launch a command line tool for managing Windows Defender, disabling scanning, removing definitions, and in some cases, disabling real-time monitoring. They also used PsExec to stop services across the organization before launching the WastedLocker ransomware.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files, aiding in the concealment of the attackers' activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.
   - **Command and Control:** The injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a command and control (C&C) domain, which was publicly reported as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.
   - **Impact:** The end goal of the WastedLocker attacks was to cripple the victim's IT infrastructure by encrypting computers and servers, leading to significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after gaining initial access using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks, the attackers will subsequently deploy Cobalt Strike using PowerShell for execution and proceed to use commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that the initial access was gained using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks.
   - **Execution:** The report states that the attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the attackers used additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts, which aligns with the use of commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the initial access was achieved using SocGholish via malicious JavaScript frameworks.
   - After gaining initial access, the attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell.
   - The report also mentions the use of additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts, which is consistent with the use of commands like "whoami", "net user", and "net group" for discovery.
