### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The malware "Machete" is distributed through social engineering tactics, including spear-phishing emails and a fake blog website.
- The malware is embedded in PowerPoint presentations disguised as self-extracting archives.
- When opened, these files install the malware on the target system.

**Persistence:**
- On infected machines, "Machete" creates a file named 'Java Update.lnk' pointing to 'appdata/Jre6/java.exe'.
- It installs the malware in 'appdata/ MicroDes/'.
- It creates a task named 'Microsoft_up'.

**Others:**
- The campaign started in 2010 and was renewed in 2012.
- Victims are primarily located in Spanish-speaking countries and include high-profile targets.
- The malware uses Python embedded into Windows executables.
- Infrastructure for Mac OS X, Unix, and Android victims was also discovered.
- Indicators of Compromise include suspicious domains and known infection artifacts.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether "Machete" is likely to capture audio from the computer's microphone and copy files to a special USB device during the collection phase.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The report details the initial access and persistence mechanisms of "Machete".
- It mentions the use of Python and the presence of infrastructure for multiple operating systems and mobile devices.
- However, the report does not explicitly mention any capabilities related to capturing audio or copying files to USB devices.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that "Machete" has the capability to capture audio and copy files to USB devices during the collection phase.
- **B: No** - This would imply that "Machete" does not have these capabilities.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not provide any specific information about "Machete" capturing audio or copying files to USB devices.
- The report focuses on the initial access and persistence mechanisms, which are well-documented.
- The absence of such details in the report suggests that these capabilities are not a known or primary feature of "Machete".

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the lack of evidence in the CTI report supporting the capabilities of capturing audio or copying files to USB devices, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
