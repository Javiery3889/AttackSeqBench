### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Execution:** FIN13 uses JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. They also use passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Persistence:** FIN13 uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and SWEARJAR for persistence. They also use MAILSLOT for command and control via email.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** FIN13 uses ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and Mimikatz to extract credentials. They also use certutil for obfuscation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** FIN13 uses passive backdoors, custom droppers like LATCHKEY, and malware like DRAWSTRING.
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 uses process memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Discovery:** FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** FIN13 uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after using ProcDump to dump LSASS process memory and executing passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE for command execution, FIN13 exploits external servers and deploys web shells to establish initial access into victim networks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention how FIN13 establishes initial access. However, it does mention the use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration and command and control.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - **ProcDump and LSASS Dumping:** This is part of the privilege escalation and credential access phases.
     - **Passive Backdoors (BLUEAGAVE):** This is used for command execution and persistence.
     - **Web Shells and External Servers:** The report mentions the use of web shells for exfiltration and command and control, but it does not specify that these are used for initial access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The use of ProcDump and BLUEAGAVE suggests that FIN13 is already inside the network and is performing privilege escalation and command execution.
   - The deployment of web shells and exploitation of external servers is more likely to be part of the command and control and exfiltration phases, rather than the initial access phase.
   - The report does not provide clear evidence that FIN13 uses web shells to establish initial access. Instead, it focuses on the use of web shells for maintaining control and exfiltrating data.
