### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Defense Evasion:**
  - **AtomBombing Technique:**
    - Bypasses process-level restrictions.
    - Injects malicious code into trusted processes.
    - Evades security products.
    - Accesses context-specific data (e.g., screenshots, MitB attacks, encrypted passwords).
    - Does not require exploiting OS bugs or vulnerabilities.
    - Cannot be fixed with a patch.
    - Security products must monitor API calls for malicious activity to mitigate this technique.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question:**
  - After threat actors use AtomBombing to leverage Windows operating system mechanisms for malicious code injection and execute it via legitimate programs, is it likely that they will bypass antivirus (AV), next-generation antivirus (NGAV), and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy?
- **Answer Choices:**
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Key Points from the CTI Report:**
  - AtomBombing bypasses process-level restrictions.
  - It injects malicious code into trusted processes.
  - It evades security products.
  - It does not require exploiting OS bugs or vulnerabilities.
  - It cannot be fixed with a patch.
  - Security products must monitor API calls to detect this technique.

- **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
  - **Choice A: Yes**
    - This aligns with the report's description that AtomBombing is designed to evade security products, including AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.
    - The report explicitly states that AtomBombing can bypass security products and does not require exploiting vulnerabilities, making it a significant concern for these solutions.
  - **Choice B: No**
    - This does not align with the report's description. The report clearly indicates that AtomBombing is a technique that evades security products, making it unlikely that it would not bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning:**
  - The CTI report emphasizes that AtomBombing is a sophisticated technique that allows threat actors to inject malicious code into trusted processes, thereby evading security products.
  - The report explicitly states that AtomBombing does not require exploiting OS bugs or vulnerabilities and cannot be fixed with a patch, making it a significant threat to security solutions.
  - Given these points, it is highly likely that threat actors using AtomBombing will bypass AV, NGAV, and endpoint infiltration prevention solutions as part of their defense evasion strategy.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
