### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The campaign uses malicious delivery documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
     - Payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded from the internet.
   - **Execution:**
     - After enabling macros, two files are created in the ProgramData directory in randomly-named directories.
     - The .VBS script is used to execute the PowerShell script.
     - The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation.
     - Scriptlet and inf files use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - **Collection:**
     - The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with the C&C server is done via XML messages.
     - The backdoor finds the machine's IP address and location information and sends it to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that two files, including a VBS script, will be created in randomly named ProgramData directories before the path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - From the **Execution** section of the CTI report:
     - "After enabling the macros and the payload executes, two files are created in the ProgramData directory placed in randomly-named directories."
     - "The purpose of the .VBS script is to execute the PowerShell script."
     - "The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence."
   - These statements directly confirm that two files, including a VBS script, are created in randomly named ProgramData directories, and the path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that after enabling macros, two files are created in the ProgramData directory.
   - One of these files is a VBS script.
   - The path to this VBS script is then added to the task scheduler for persistence.
   - This sequence matches the description in the question.
