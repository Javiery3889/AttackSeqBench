### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The report mentions that attackers use phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion. These emails are often sent from genuine accounts within a client's supply chain, indicating a sophisticated and targeted approach.
- **Exfiltration**: The report describes ransomware attacks where attackers first gain access to systems, exfiltrate data, and then encrypt it. This suggests a multi-stage attack where data exfiltration is a key step.
- **Others**: The report provides additional context about the legal and regulatory implications of cyber attacks, but this information is secondary to the attack sequence.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks whether it is likely that threat actors targeting SolarWinds and Kaseya cyber-attacks will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts after using phishing emails as an initial point of intrusion.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The CTI report clearly states that phishing emails are used as an initial point of intrusion. This aligns with the question's premise.
- **Reconnaissance**: The report does not explicitly mention reconnaissance efforts, but it is a common and logical next step in a multi-stage attack. After gaining initial access, threat actors typically gather information about the victim's network, systems, and potential targets to plan further actions.
- **SolarWinds and Kaseya**: These are well-known cyber-attacks where threat actors used sophisticated methods to gain access and move laterally within networks. Reconnaissance is a critical phase in such attacks to understand the victim's environment and identify high-value targets.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Step 1**: The CTI report confirms that phishing emails are used for initial access.
- **Step 2**: While the report does not explicitly mention reconnaissance, it is a standard practice in advanced cyber-attacks to gather information about the victim's environment.
- **Step 3**: The SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks are known for their sophisticated nature, which includes detailed reconnaissance to understand the victim's network and systems.
- **Step 4**: Given the sophistication of these attacks and the common practice of reconnaissance in multi-stage attacks, it is highly likely that threat actors will gather victim organization information during their reconnaissance efforts.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
