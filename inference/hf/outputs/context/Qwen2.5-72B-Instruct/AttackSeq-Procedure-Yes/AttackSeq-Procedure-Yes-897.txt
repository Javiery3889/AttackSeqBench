### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Methods:**
  - Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros.
  - RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading.
- **RAR File Names:** In Vietnamese, indicating primary targets are in Vietnam or Vietnamese-speaking individuals.

**Defense Evasion:**
- **Techniques:**
  - Reused VBS decode function to decode base64 blobs.
  - KerrDown DLL dropped in 'Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\' as 'main_background.png'.
  - Payload retrieved from a URL, decrypted using DES, and executed in memory.
  - Only the KerrDown DLL is saved on the system; the payload is executed in memory.

**Command and Control:**
- **Final Payload:**
  - Variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.
  - KerrDown downloader attempts to download the payload from a URL based on the victim's OS architecture.

**Others:**
- **Compile Timestamps:** Suggest active use since March 2018.
- **Working Hours:** 9 AM to 6 PM GMT+7, indicating operations likely from Vietnam or nearby countries.
- **Target Base:** Broader geographic and industry-wide, suggesting similar tools and playbooks.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After delivering KerrDown to targets via malicious Microsoft Office Documents with macros or RAR archives enabling DLL side-loading, is it likely that the Office document will contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros before using base64 blobs to execute the malicious payload based on the victim's system architecture?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Initial Access:**
  - Malicious Office documents with macros.
  - RAR archives with DLL side-loading.
- **Defense Evasion:**
  - Base64 blobs are used.
  - Payload is executed in memory based on the victim's system architecture.

**Evaluation:**
- **Office Document with Macros:**
  - The report mentions that Office documents with malicious macros are used for initial access.
  - It is common for such documents to contain social engineering elements, such as images or text, to trick the victim into enabling macros.
- **Base64 Blobs:**
  - The report explicitly states that base64 blobs are used in the VBS decode function.
- **Payload Execution:**
  - The payload is retrieved from a URL, decrypted, and executed in memory based on the victim's system architecture.

**Plausibility:**
- It is plausible that the Office document would contain an image or text instructing the victim to enable macros to facilitate the execution of the malicious payload.
- The use of base64 blobs and the execution of the payload based on the victim's system architecture aligns with the techniques described in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report confirms the use of malicious Office documents with macros for initial access.
2. It is a common social engineering technique to include an image or text in the document to trick the victim into enabling macros.
3. The report also confirms the use of base64 blobs and the execution of the payload in memory based on the victim's system architecture.
4. Therefore, it is likely that the Office document would contain an image file instructing the victim to enable macros.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
