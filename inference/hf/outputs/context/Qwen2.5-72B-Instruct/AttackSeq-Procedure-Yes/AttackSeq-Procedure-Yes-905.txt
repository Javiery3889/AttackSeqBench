### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- Dexphot wrote five key files to disk: an installer with two URLs, an MSI package file, a password-protected ZIP archive, a loader DLL, and an encrypted data file containing three additional executables.
- These executables were loaded into system processes via process hollowing, targeting legitimate system processes such as msiexec.exe, unzip.exe, rundll32.exe, schtasks.exe, and powershell.exe, and later svchost.exe, tracert.exe, and setup.exe.

**Persistence:**
- Dexphot ensured persistence through dual monitoring services that checked the status of all three malicious processes and re-infected the device if any were terminated.
- It used schtasks.exe to create scheduled tasks for updates and re-infection, employing techniques like Scheduled Task and Signed Binary Proxy Execution.
- The tasks called msiexec.exe as a proxy to run the malicious code and updated Dexphot's components upon system reboot and every 90 or 110 minutes while the system was running.

**Others:**
- Microsoft Defender ATP Research Team, led by Hazel Kim, closely monitored the Dexphot threat for over a year, observing its evolution and the attackers' efforts to upgrade the malware, target new processes, and work around defensive measures.
- Microsoft Defender ATP's behavioral blocking and containment capabilities were crucial in stopping the Dexphot campaign.
- The team's insights into the goals and motivations of Dexphot's authors contributed to a broader understanding of cybercriminal behavior.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes during the execution stage, is Dexphot likely to utilize fileless techniques for defense evasion to prevent detection and obfuscate its activities?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Process Hollowing:** Dexphot used process hollowing to load executables into legitimate system processes.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Dexphot used scheduled tasks and signed binary proxy execution to ensure persistence.
- **File Operations:** Dexphot wrote multiple files to disk, including an installer, an MSI package, a ZIP archive, a loader DLL, and an encrypted data file.

**Evaluation:**
- **Process Hollowing:** This technique is a form of defense evasion that involves injecting malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process, which can help avoid detection by security software.
- **File Operations:** Despite using process hollowing, Dexphot also wrote files to disk, which is not a fileless technique. Fileless techniques typically involve running malicious code entirely in memory without writing to the disk.
- **Persistence:** The use of scheduled tasks and signed binary proxy execution are sophisticated methods to maintain persistence, but they do not necessarily indicate the use of fileless techniques.

**Conclusion:**
- While Dexphot used process hollowing, which is a form of defense evasion, it also relied on writing files to disk. This suggests that Dexphot did not fully adopt fileless techniques to prevent detection and obfuscate its activities.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: B: No
