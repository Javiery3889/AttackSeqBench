### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Execution:** The ThreatNeedle backdoor was executed in a multistage deployment procedure, starting with a spear-phishing document that loaded the next stage in-memory.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware implanted the next stage loader-type malware and registered it for auto-execution to achieve persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Various techniques were used to evade detection, including deleting log files and using custom web shells.
   - **Credential Access:** A credential harvesting tool named Responder was used to acquire login credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Collection:** Collected data was archived for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Multiple servers were used, with a compromised router serving as a proxy.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Lazarus group is likely to achieve persistence by implanting loader-type malware registered for auto-execution before conducting discovery activities like system owner/user discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution:** The ThreatNeedle backdoor was used for initial reconnaissance and to deploy additional malware.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware implanted the next stage loader-type malware and registered it for auto-execution to achieve persistence.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly state the order of persistence and discovery activities, but it is logical to assume that achieving persistence is a critical step before conducting extensive discovery activities to ensure the attackers can maintain access and continue their operations.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The ThreatNeedle backdoor is executed for initial reconnaissance and to deploy additional malware.
   - The next step is to achieve persistence by implanting loader-type malware and registering it for auto-execution.
   - Once persistence is established, the attackers can then conduct discovery activities to gather more information about the system and its users.
