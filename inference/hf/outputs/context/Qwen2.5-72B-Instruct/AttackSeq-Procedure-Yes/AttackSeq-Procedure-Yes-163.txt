### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Charming Kitten uses spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather information such as phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication.
     - Targets include academic researchers, human rights activists, opposition to Iran's regime, journalists, and prominent Iranians living abroad.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gains initial access through spear-phishing methods, including emails and SMS messages impersonating Google Drive, Yahoo services, and social networks.
     - Sends messages from seemingly known contacts or services, prompting victims to click on malicious links leading to phishing sites designed to steal credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Uses tactics such as redirecting victims to legitimate services after an attack, using self-signed digital certificates for phishing sites, and employing domain shortening services to conceal the actual malicious URLs.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Primary goal is to access credentials by directing victims to phishing pages that impersonate login pages for services like Google Drive and Yahoo.
     - Manipulates victims into entering their credentials, believing they are accessing legitimate services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Charming Kitten will proceed to acquire infrastructures by developing phishing sites that impersonate legitimate services (Google Drive, Yahoo, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter) before leveraging them to gain initial access through credential-stealing spear-phishing attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report confirms that Charming Kitten uses spear-phishing emails and SMS messages to gather sensitive information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that Charming Kitten gains initial access through spear-phishing methods, including emails and SMS messages impersonating legitimate services.
   - **Phishing Sites:**
     - The report mentions that Charming Kitten uses phishing sites to steal credentials, which implies they have already developed and are using such infrastructures.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question (reconnaissance followed by developing phishing sites and then using them for initial access) aligns with the attack sequence described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Charming Kitten gathers information through spear-phishing emails and SMS messages.
   - **Developing Phishing Sites:**
     - The report indicates that Charming Kitten uses phishing sites to steal credentials, which suggests they have already developed these infrastructures.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Charming Kitten uses these phishing sites to gain initial access by stealing credentials through spear-phishing attacks.
