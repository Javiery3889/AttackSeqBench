### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They used account manipulation, BITS jobs, creating accounts, modifying system processes, and leveraging external remote services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including abuse of elevation control mechanisms, BITS jobs, deobfuscating/decoding files, hiding artifacts, and using signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Earth Lusca is likely to leverage application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for command and control (C2) to mimic normal traffic and evade detection after establishing persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used account manipulation and the creation of scheduled tasks to maintain access to systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report states that Earth Lusca used various techniques to avoid detection, including hiding artifacts, impairing defenses, and using signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that they used C2 channels for data exfiltration, ensuring that the stolen data was packaged to avoid detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Earth Lusca has a strong focus on defense evasion and ensuring that their activities are not detected, it is highly likely that they would use application layer protocols and data obfuscation techniques for C2.
   - The use of C2 channels for data exfiltration, as mentioned in the report, suggests that they are already employing techniques to mimic normal traffic and avoid detection.
   - The combination of persistence techniques and defense evasion strategies indicates a sophisticated approach to maintaining access and avoiding detection.
