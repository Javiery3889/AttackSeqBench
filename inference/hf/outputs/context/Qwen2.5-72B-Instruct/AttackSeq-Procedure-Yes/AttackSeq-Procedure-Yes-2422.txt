### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers used mules to open bank accounts and request debit/ATM cards.
     - They gained initial entry through phishing emails to employees, leading to backdoors.
     - Social engineering techniques were used to obtain backdoor access.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious payloads were executed, including the installation of 'Mipko' on the processor's Terminal Server.
     - 'Mipko' captured screen captures and keystrokes.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The attackers used control weaknesses in the Windows network for lateral movement.
     - They compromised the Enterprise Admin account.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - They used legitimate Windows and PowerShell commands, PSExec, and plink.exe for lateral movement.
     - They used commercial monitoring applications and 'Cobalt Strike Beacon' for backdoor connections.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The attackers identified and used bank employee accounts with authorization to manipulate customer debit cards.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - They coordinated ATM withdrawals using physical mules across multiple cities and countries.
   - **Impact:**
     - They manipulated the bank's internal systems to enable high overdraft levels and removed anti-fraud controls.
     - They performed cash withdrawals using manipulated debit cards, removing up to USD$10 million from each bank.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers leveraged captured credentials during lateral movement before coordinating ATM withdrawals using physical mules across multiple cities and countries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The attackers used social engineering and phishing to gain initial access.
     - They executed malicious payloads, including 'Mipko', which captured keystrokes and screen captures.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Defense Evasion:**
     - They used captured credentials and legitimate tools for lateral movement.
     - They compromised the Enterprise Admin account, which gave them full access to the infrastructure.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - They identified and used bank employee accounts to manipulate customer debit cards.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - They coordinated ATM withdrawals using physical mules.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers gained initial access through social engineering and phishing.
   - They executed 'Mipko' to capture keystrokes and screen captures, which likely included credentials.
   - They used these captured credentials to perform lateral movement and gain higher privileges.
   - They compromised the Enterprise Admin account, which gave them full access to the network.
   - They used the compromised credentials to manipulate customer debit cards.
   - They coordinated ATM withdrawals using physical mules.
