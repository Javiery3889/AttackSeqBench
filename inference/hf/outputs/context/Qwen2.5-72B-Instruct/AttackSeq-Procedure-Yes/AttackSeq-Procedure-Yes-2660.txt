### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Persistence is established by creating hidden directories and setting up scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects extensive system information and metadata.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers is done using a custom TCP-based protocol, with initial handshakes over HTTPS or TCP, and subsequent communication over TCP. The communication is encrypted using RC4.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after performing data discovery, Korplug is likely to use a custom protocol for data exfiltration over TCP involving compressed and encrypted messages.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Collection:** The report states that Korplug collects extensive information about the system and data from various drives.
   - **Command and Control:** The report mentions that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol and that the communication is encrypted using RC4.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** While the report does not explicitly state that the data is compressed, it does mention that the communication is encrypted and uses a custom protocol.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that Korplug uses a custom TCP-based protocol for communication with C&C servers and that this communication is encrypted.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the malware and the group's focus on defense evasion, it is reasonable to assume that the data exfiltration would also be encrypted and possibly compressed to avoid detection.
   - The use of a custom protocol and encryption aligns with the group's known tactics of using advanced techniques to evade detection.
