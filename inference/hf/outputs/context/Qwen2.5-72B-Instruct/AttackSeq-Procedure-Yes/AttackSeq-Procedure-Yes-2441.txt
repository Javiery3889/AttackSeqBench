### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The threat group DRAGONFISH distributes Elise malware through a malicious Microsoft Word document.
- The document contains an OLE object that drops and executes a malicious executable in the %temp% folder.
- The payload is moved to \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ as NavShExt.dll.
- The original executable is deleted.

**Execution:**
- Elise malware starts iexplore.exe in a suspended state.
- It injects NavShExt.dll into iexplore.exe and calls the 'Setting' export function.
- A mutex named 'donotbotherme' is created to prevent duplicate executions.
- Harvested data is stored in thumbcache_1CD60.db.
- Data is sent to and files/commands are downloaded from the C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14.

**Persistence:**
- Persistence is achieved via the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD.
- Two hidden DLLs with export functions named DePatchEntry or EvilEntry are injected into iexplore.exe.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Anti-virtual-machine features, obfuscation, and base64-encoded cookie values for data exfiltration.
- Spoofing non-existing domains to mislead analysts.
- Debug paths are stripped from the malware.

**Discovery:**
- The malware collects system information including IP addresses, installed software, proxy information, process enumeration, and files on the desktop.

**Others:**
- The campaign targets the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) for espionage.
- The malware can provide a remote shell and uninstall itself.
- Security teams are advised to block the C2 server and patch the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.
- Artifacts to look for include the IAStorD autorun key, FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp, donotbotherme mutex, and thumbcache_1CD60.db.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Elise malware collects system information such as IP addresses, installed software, and process enumeration for discovery purposes, is it likely to communicate with the hardcoded C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14 using an application layer protocol for Command and Control?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware collects extensive system information (IP addresses, installed software, process enumeration).
- It sends data to and downloads files/commands from the C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14.
- The C2 communication is part of the malware's execution phase.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that the malware sends data to and downloads files/commands from the C2 server.
- This communication is necessary for the malware to exfiltrate the collected data and receive further instructions.
- The use of an application layer protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) is a common method for C2 communication in malware.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The malware collects system information as part of its discovery phase.
2. The collected data is stored in thumbcache_1CD60.db.
3. The malware sends this data to the C2 server at 103.236.150[.]14.
4. The C2 server is used for both exfiltration and receiving commands.
5. Application layer protocols are commonly used for C2 communication in malware.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
