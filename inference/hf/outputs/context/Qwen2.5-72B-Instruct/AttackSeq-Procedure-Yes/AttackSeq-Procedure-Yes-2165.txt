### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Word .DOC file.
- The .DOC file exploits the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to drop the main module "net.exe".
- "net.exe" installs other files, including the main C&C module "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL".

**Persistence:**
- The malware registers "WINDOWSUPDATANEY.DLL" as a service named "Windowsupdata" using a Windows Batch file "DOT.BAT".
- The malware uses mutexes like "SD_2013 Is Running!" to ensure it isn't running multiple times.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicates with C&C servers such as "uygurinfo[.]com", "ssdcru[.]com", "samedone[.]com", "gobackto[.]net", "worksware[.]net", "jojomic[.]com", "angellost[.]net", and "husden[.]com".

**Others:**
- The NetTraveler APT has been active for 10 years and targets various sectors, with a focus on diplomatic, government, and military targets.
- Recent interests include space exploration, nano-technology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine, and communications.
- The targeting of Uyghur and Tibetan activists is a consistent aspect of their activities.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the NetTraveler malware will use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its configuration before revealing C&C servers such as "uygurinfo[.]com" through decryption using the provided algorithm.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses a sophisticated method to ensure persistence and avoid detection (e.g., registering as a service, using mutexes).
- The C&C servers are explicitly listed in the report, suggesting they are not obfuscated in the report itself.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This would imply that the malware uses a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its C&C server information.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the malware does not use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate its C&C server information.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides the C&C server domains directly, which suggests that the malware does not use a simple encryption scheme to obfuscate these domains in the report.
- Advanced APTs like NetTraveler often use sophisticated methods to hide their C&C infrastructure, but the report's direct listing of the C&C servers indicates that the obfuscation, if any, is not simple or is not relevant to the report's context.
- The use of mutexes and service registration indicates a focus on persistence and stealth, but not necessarily on simple encryption for C&C server information.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: B: No
