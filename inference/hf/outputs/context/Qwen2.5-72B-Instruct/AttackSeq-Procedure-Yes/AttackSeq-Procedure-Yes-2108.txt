### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from government-related entities. The attachments used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files were weaponized using a variant of RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that ran the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, gathered data on the victim's computer, and encrypted and sent it to the C&C server. The loader decrypted and executed shellcode stored encrypted within the binary.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor installed by the attackers had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using a configuration that contained the server IP and port. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return. The communication was encrypted and followed a specific format involving XORed TypeID and Data with a 256-byte key.
   - **Impact:** The backdoor had the capability to shut down the victim's computer, which could be used to disrupt operations and impact the availability of the system.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers leveraged the backdoor's capabilities to collect detailed system information such as file manipulation, screenshots, and network details before exfiltrating the collected data over the established C&C channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Communication:** The backdoor communicated with the C&C server using an encrypted protocol to send a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return.
   - **Data Collection Capabilities:** The backdoor had capabilities to collect a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - **Exfiltration:** The communication with the C&C server was encrypted and followed a specific format, indicating that the collected data would be exfiltrated over this channel.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor's initial communication with the C&C server involved sending a 'Start conversation' message and receiving a 'Get Victim Information' message. This suggests that the C&C server is instructing the backdoor to gather and send detailed system information.
   - The backdoor's capabilities include collecting detailed system information such as file manipulation, screenshots, and network details.
   - Given the detailed data collection capabilities and the encrypted communication channel, it is highly likely that the attackers would leverage these capabilities to collect and exfiltrate the data.
