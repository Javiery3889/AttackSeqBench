### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives, and used WinRAR to compress files into archives.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems, including encrypted channels and protocol tunneling.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Earth Lusca used WinRAR to package files from local systems and network shared drives into archives before exfiltrating these files over their C2 channels to avoid detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that Earth Lusca used WinRAR to compress files into archives and the megacmd tool to upload the archive to the Mega service for exfiltration.
   - This aligns with the question's assertion that they used WinRAR to package files and exfiltrate them over C2 channels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides clear evidence that Earth Lusca used WinRAR to compress files.
   - The report also mentions that they used the megacmd tool to upload the compressed files to the Mega service, which is a form of exfiltration.
   - The use of WinRAR and megacmd suggests a method to avoid detection by compressing and encrypting the data before exfiltration.
