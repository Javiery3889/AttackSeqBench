### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.
   - **Collection:** APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use custom malware to exfiltrate files to Dropbox and employ cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files during the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated it to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of custom malware for exfiltration. Instead, it specifies the use of cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files to Dropbox.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that APT10 used cURL for Windows to upload the exfiltrated files to Dropbox. This is a specific and detailed method of exfiltration.
   - The report does not mention the use of custom malware for exfiltration. While APT10 has used custom malware (Trochilus and UPPERCUT) in other phases, the exfiltration method described is the use of cURL for Windows.
   - Given the specific details provided in the report, it is more likely that the attackers used the method described (cURL for Windows) rather than an unspecified custom malware for exfiltration.
