### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Dridex is spread using spambots (Necurs, Cutwail, Andromeda) that send emails with malicious documents.
     - These documents contain embedded macros that, when executed, download and run the Dridex payload.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Dridex malware consists of a loader and a payload.
     - The loader uses the `OutputDebugStringW` function to generate debug messages and complicate analysis.
     - The payload is heavily obfuscated, with call resolutions using hash values and strings encrypted with RC4.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Anti-debug techniques and obfuscation are employed.
     - The loader generates a large number of debug messages in a loop (200 million iterations).
     - The payload uses hash values for call resolutions and RC4 encryption for string obfuscation.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after employing anti-debug techniques and obfuscation loops for defense evasion, Dridex is likely to send encrypted POST requests containing data like the computer name and botnet ID to connect to proxy servers used for command and control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Anti-Debug Techniques and Obfuscation:**
     - The report clearly states that Dridex employs anti-debug techniques and obfuscation to evade detection.
     - The loader uses `OutputDebugStringW` to generate debug messages and the payload uses hash values and RC4 encryption.
   - **Network Activity:**
     - The report mentions network activity and the use of IP addresses to map the malware's network.
     - It also indicates the detection of Dridex spikes, suggesting successful interception at early stages.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Communication:**
     - While the report does not explicitly state that Dridex sends encrypted POST requests containing the computer name and botnet ID, it is a common practice for malware to communicate with C2 servers using encrypted data to avoid detection.
     - Given the sophisticated nature of Dridex and its use of obfuscation and anti-debug techniques, it is highly likely that it would use encrypted communication for C2.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the detailed analysis of the CTI report and the common practices of sophisticated malware, it is highly likely that Dridex will send encrypted POST requests containing data like the computer name and botnet ID to connect to proxy servers used for command and control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
