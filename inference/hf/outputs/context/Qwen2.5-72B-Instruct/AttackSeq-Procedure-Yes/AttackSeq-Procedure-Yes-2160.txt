### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Initial Access**: APT35 used spear phishing emails to compromise a corporate device.
- **Persistence**: The infected device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing, indicating a maintained foothold.
- **Defense Evasion**: APT35 evaded detection by conducting minimal activity and avoiding security alerts.
- **Discovery**: Darktrace's Cyber AI detected the C2 traffic, leading to the identification of the compromised device.
- **Lateral Movement**: No lateral movement or data exfiltration was detected after the C2 beaconing.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that APT35's C2 will operate using dynamic resolution, including domains such as cortanaservice[.]com, to communicate with its infrastructure while evading detection.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access**: The report confirms that APT35 used spear phishing emails to gain initial access.
- **Persistence**: The report mentions persistent C2 beaconing, which is a common technique for maintaining a foothold.
- **Defense Evasion**: APT35's strategy of lying low and avoiding detection aligns with the use of dynamic resolution and domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to evade detection. DGAs can generate a large number of domain names, making it harder for defenders to block or detect C2 traffic.
- **Discovery**: Darktrace's Cyber AI detected the C2 traffic, which suggests that the C2 communication was not entirely undetectable but was sophisticated enough to evade initial detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reasoning**:
  - APT35 is known for sophisticated and stealthy operations.
  - The use of dynamic resolution and DGAs is a common technique for evading detection and maintaining persistent C2 communication.
  - The report mentions that APT35 managed to evade detection by conducting minimal activity, which aligns with the use of dynamic resolution to avoid triggering security alerts.
  - The detection by Darktrace's Cyber AI suggests that while the C2 traffic was sophisticated, it was eventually identified, which is consistent with the use of dynamic resolution.

- **Final Answer**: A: Yes

The use of dynamic resolution, including domains such as cortanaservice[.]com, is likely a part of APT35's C2 infrastructure to maintain communication while evading detection.
