### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Targeted Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, and CVE-2021-44026 in Roundcube webmail software.
     - Scripts redirected incoming emails, performed reconnaissance, and exfiltrated session and user information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2020-35730 in Roundcube mail servers.
     - Also exploited CVE-2023-23397 in Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Execution:**
     - Executed malicious scripts through Roundcube vulnerabilities.
     - Redirected future incoming emails and performed reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used obfuscation techniques and encoded data to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Dumped OS credentials, including /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
   - **Collection:**
     - Created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails to an actor-controlled email address.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used web protocols and standard encoding for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrated session cookie, address book, and database information over alternative protocols.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the BlueDelta campaign is likely to perform system information discovery by exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software before utilizing Roundcubeâ€™s managesieve plugin to collect emails by auto-forwarding them to an actor-controlled email address.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta accessed credentials by exploiting Roundcube vulnerabilities to dump OS credentials, including /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
   - **System Information Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that the campaign performed reconnaissance on the target Roundcube server, which can be considered a form of system information discovery.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report states that BlueDelta created a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails to an actor-controlled email address.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that after gaining initial access and executing malicious scripts, the campaign performed reconnaissance (system information discovery) on the target Roundcube server.
   - After gaining credential access by dumping OS credentials, the campaign then proceeded to set up the managesieve plugin to auto-forward emails.
   - The reconnaissance activities (system information discovery) are mentioned before the collection activities, indicating that the campaign likely performed system information discovery before setting up the email forwarding.
