### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices. They have advanced reconnaissance capabilities.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and possess advanced mathematical and crypto-analytical capabilities.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates for popular packages such as Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash, and Windows Messenger. They also seed Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence on compromised systems through malware that adds autorun registry settings for automatic start during system boot.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign their backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in various browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They use keyloggers and information stealers to collect and encrypt data.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data on their servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Darkhotel APT is likely to use 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer to execute malicious code after seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with malware for initial access, and then maintain persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report mentions that Darkhotel APT gains initial access by targeting hotel guests with malware posing as legitimate software updates and by seeding Japanese P2P sharing sites with their malware.
   - **0-day Exploits:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, the APT's advanced capabilities and the use of sophisticated techniques suggest they might have the capability to use such exploits.
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that they maintain persistence through malware that adds autorun registry settings for automatic start during system boot.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide direct evidence of 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, given the APT's advanced capabilities and the sophistication of their operations, it is plausible that they might use such exploits.
   - The report explicitly mentions the use of malware that adds autorun registry settings for persistence, which aligns with the question.

### Final Answer
Given the advanced capabilities of Darkhotel APT and the sophistication of their operations, it is plausible that they might use 0-day exploits targeting Adobe products and Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, the report does not provide direct evidence of this. The persistence method mentioned in the report aligns with the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
