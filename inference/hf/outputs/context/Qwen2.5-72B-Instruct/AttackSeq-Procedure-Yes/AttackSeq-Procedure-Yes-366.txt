### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN8 uses BADHATCH v2.14 to gain initial access.
     - BADHATCH downloads and executes a script from a domain mapped by sslip.io.
     - The script uses base64 representations of shellcode and a .NET binary to execute in memory.
   - **Execution:**
     - BADHATCH can operate in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
     - POWERSHELL mode uses `IEX` to execute commands from a pipe.
     - CMD mode uses `cmd.exe` to execute commands.
   - **Persistence:**
     - WMI event subscription mechanism is used for persistence.
     - A PowerShell script sets up an event consumer named PerfData.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Privilege escalation is indicated by the execution of `sh-tmp.ps1`.
     - Subsequent commands are executed on behalf of the SYSTEM user.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TLS encryption and masquerading communication as legitimate HTTP requests.
     - Use of a proxy for TLS encryption and redirection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Credential dumping using `mimi.ps1` and reading the memory of `lsass.exe`.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Lateral movement to the Domain Controller using `wmic.exe` and `wmiexec.py`.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers will use commands like `whoami.exe` to perform system owner/user discovery before conducting domain trust discovery using tools such as `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report confirms that BADHATCH is used to gain initial access and execute commands in CMD or POWERSHELL mode.
   - **System Owner/User Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of `whoami.exe` for system owner/user discovery.
   - **Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of `nltest.exe` or `ping.exe` for domain trust discovery.
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The report indicates that the attackers use various commands and scripts to gather information and move laterally.
     - The use of `whoami.exe` is a common step in the reconnaissance phase to understand the current user context.
     - Domain trust discovery is a logical next step after understanding the user context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The attackers use BADHATCH to gain initial access and execute commands.
   - **System Owner/User Discovery:**
     - While not explicitly mentioned, using `whoami.exe` is a common and logical step to understand the current user context.
   - **Domain Trust Discovery:**
     - After understanding the user context, the attackers would likely want to discover domain trust relationships to facilitate lateral movement.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The sequence of using `whoami.exe` for system owner/user discovery before conducting domain trust discovery using `nltest.exe` and `ping.exe` is a plausible and logical sequence of actions for an attacker.
