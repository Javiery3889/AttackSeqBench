### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Shamoon malware was deployed and designed to overwrite data on disks.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes as a scheduled job, deletes the job file, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver to facilitate disk access for destructive operations.
   - **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by entrenching itself as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware overwrites data in the Documents and Settings folder, System32 folder, and then starts physical disk access to wipe the disk at the disk level. It also overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR) to prevent access to the affected file systems.
   - **Command and Control:** Fidelis researchers have developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware throughout the threat life cycle.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after entrenching itself as a service and executing the dropped driver, Shamoon will eventually overwrite the disk's boot records to prevent access to the targeted file system and target both user and system data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report confirms that Shamoon entrenches itself as a service for persistence.
   - **Execution of Dropped Driver:** The report states that the dropped driver is loaded and executed to facilitate disk access for destructive operations.
   - **Overwriting Disk Boot Records:** The report explicitly mentions that Shamoon overwrites the MBR and VBR to prevent access to the affected file systems.
   - **Targeting User and System Data:** The report indicates that Shamoon overwrites data in the Documents and Settings folder (user data) and the System32 folder (system data).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that Shamoon overwrites the MBR and VBR to prevent access to the file system.
   - The report also confirms that Shamoon targets both user data (Documents and Settings) and system data (System32).
   - The sequence of events described in the report aligns with the question's scenario: after entrenching itself as a service and executing the dropped driver, Shamoon proceeds to overwrite the disk's boot records and target both user and system data.
