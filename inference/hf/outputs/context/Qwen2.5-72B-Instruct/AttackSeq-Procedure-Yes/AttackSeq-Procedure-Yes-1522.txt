### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The attackers compromised the Afghan Government's CDN server, cdn.afghanistan.af, and modified the Javascript file `jquery-1.4.2.min.js` to load additional malicious code from the IP address 176.58.101.24.
- **Others**: The attackers used IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation, suggesting a targeted campaign. The primary network indicator is communication with the IP address 176.58.101.24.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers obfuscated the malicious code by appending it to the existing Javascript file and encoding it with Dean Edwards Packer for defense evasion.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Attack Sequence from CTI Report**:
  1. **Initial Access**: Compromise the CDN server.
  2. **Execution**: Modify the Javascript file to load additional malicious code.
  3. **Command and Control**: Use the IP address 176.58.101.24 for communication.
- **Question Context**:
  - The question focuses on the method of obfuscation used by the attackers.
  - Obfuscation is a common technique used to evade detection and analysis of malicious code.

- **Evaluation of Answer Choices**:
  - **Choice A: Yes**:
    - Obfuscation is a common technique in cyber attacks to hide the true nature of the malicious code.
    - Dean Edwards Packer is a well-known tool for obfuscating Javascript code.
    - Given the sophistication of the attack (targeted campaign, IP whitelisting), it is plausible that the attackers would use obfuscation to avoid detection.
  - **Choice B: No**:
    - This choice suggests that the attackers did not use obfuscation.
    - However, the report does not explicitly state that the code was not obfuscated, and given the nature of the attack, it is more likely that they would use such techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- The CTI report describes a sophisticated attack involving the compromise of a CDN server and the modification of a Javascript file to load additional malicious code.
- The use of IP address whitelisting and selective exploitation indicates a targeted and well-planned campaign.
- Obfuscation is a common technique used in such attacks to evade detection and analysis.
- Dean Edwards Packer is a well-known tool for obfuscating Javascript code, making it a plausible choice for the attackers to use.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
