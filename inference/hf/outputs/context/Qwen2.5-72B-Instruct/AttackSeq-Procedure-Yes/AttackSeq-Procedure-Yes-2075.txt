### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Resource Development:**
- RIG EK uses known browser vulnerabilities to execute commands on victim machines.
- Uses malvertising and compromised websites to redirect users to its landing page.

**Initial Access:**
- RIG EK delivers exploits to victims through malvertising.
- Redirects users to advertising pages that execute RIG exploits.
- Also uses compromised sites with injected exploit kit javascript.
- This aligns with the Drive-by Compromise technique.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Uses proxy servers to make infections harder to detect.
- Has an integrated Antivirus testing feature to check if the malware is detected by popular antivirus software.

**Command and Control:**
- Infrastructure includes Virtual Dedicated Servers (VDS), proxy servers, and an API server.
- The API serves the exploit through the proxy server, which is a reverse proxy to the VDS.
- The exploit server detects the user's browser and returns the exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm.

**Others:**
- Active since 2014, distributing various types of malware.
- Targets machines running outdated versions of Internet Explorer.
- Operates as a service model, distributing different types of malware for various threat actors.
- Most successful campaigns in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the Middle East.
- Highest exploit try rates and successful infections on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
- Operators have a close relationship with the developer of Dridex malware.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
Is it likely that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising by redirecting users to advertising pages or compromised websites before running an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware using the Command and Scripting Interpreter?

**Answer Choices:**
A: Yes
B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report clearly states that RIG EK delivers exploits through malvertising and redirects users to advertising pages or compromised websites.
- This aligns with the Drive-by Compromise technique.

**Command and Scripting Interpreter:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of an obfuscated PowerShell script to fetch malware.
- However, it does mention that the exploit server returns the exploit code encrypted with a custom version of the RC4 algorithm, which could be a form of obfuscation.
- The use of a custom encryption algorithm suggests that the exploit code is obfuscated to some extent.

**Command and Control:**
- The report mentions the use of proxy servers and an API server to serve the exploit, which aligns with the Command and Control phase.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The use of proxy servers and an integrated Antivirus testing feature aligns with the Defense Evasion phase.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report confirms that RIG EK uses malvertising and compromised websites to deliver exploits.
- While the report does not explicitly mention the use of an obfuscated PowerShell script, it does mention the use of custom encryption, which is a form of obfuscation.
- The use of a custom encryption algorithm to deliver the exploit code is consistent with the behavior of using a Command and Scripting Interpreter to fetch malware.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
