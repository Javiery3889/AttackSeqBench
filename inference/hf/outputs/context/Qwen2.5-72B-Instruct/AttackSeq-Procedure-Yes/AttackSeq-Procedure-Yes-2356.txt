### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** BRONZE PRESIDENT targets NGOs, political, and law enforcement organizations in South and East Asia using phishing lures.
   - **Resource Development:** The group develops and uses custom and publicly available tools.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with ZIP attachments containing LNK files are used.
   - **Execution:** Tools like Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession are employed.
   - **Persistence:** WMI event consumers and scheduled tasks are used to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The group elevates privileges and installs malware on a large proportion of systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Steps are taken to minimize detection, such as deleting volume shadow copies and killing processes.
   - **Credential Access:** Credentials are collected from high-privilege accounts and NTDS.dit files.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Wmiexec is used extensively for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Custom batch scripts are used to collect and archive specific data types.
   - **Command and Control:** Various C2 techniques are used, including custom protocols and malleable C2 profiles.
   - **Exfiltration:** Tools like RCSession and Cobalt Strike are used to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to use tools like Nmap and ping to understand the network environment before extensively leveraging Wmiexec for lateral movement after elevating privileges and installing malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation and Malware Installation:** The report states that BRONZE PRESIDENT elevates privileges and installs malware on a large proportion of systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The group uses Wmiexec extensively for lateral movement.
   - **Network Scanning:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of tools like Nmap and ping for network scanning. Instead, it focuses on the use of Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement.
   - **Contextual Information:** The group's actions are described as systematic and aimed at minimizing detection. Using network scanning tools like Nmap and ping could generate a lot of network traffic and potentially trigger alerts, which the group seems to avoid.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - BRONZE PRESIDENT is known for its systematic and stealthy approach to network intrusions.
   - The group uses Wmiexec and net commands for lateral movement, which are less likely to generate significant network traffic and alerts compared to tools like Nmap and ping.
   - The report does not mention the use of network scanning tools, suggesting that the group may not rely on them to understand the network environment.
   - Given the group's focus on minimizing detection, it is less likely that they would use tools that could increase their visibility on the network.
