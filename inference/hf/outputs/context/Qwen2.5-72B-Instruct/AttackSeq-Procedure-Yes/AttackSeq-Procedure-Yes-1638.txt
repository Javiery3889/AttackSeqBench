### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Execution**: SUNSPOT malware was used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT management product builds. It monitors processes involved in the compilation of the Orion product and replaces a source file to include the SUNBURST backdoor code.
- **Persistence**: SUNSPOT maintains persistence through a scheduled task set to execute when the host boots.
- **Privilege Escalation**: SUNSPOT grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token to add SeDebugPrivilege.
- **Defense Evasion**: SUNSPOT uses encryption (AES128-CBC and RC4) to protect source code and log files, masquerades as a legitimate Windows binary, and inserts backdoor code within #pragma statements to avoid detection.
- **Discovery**: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether, after monitoring running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe as part of the Discovery tactic, it is likely that SUNSPOT will modify the Orion source code to inject the SUNBURST backdoor as part of the Impact tactic.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Discovery**: The report clearly states that SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build. This is part of the Discovery tactic.
- **Impact**: The report also states that SUNSPOT is designed to monitor processes involved in the compilation of the Orion product and replace a source file to include the SUNBURST backdoor code. This action is part of the Impact tactic, as it directly affects the functionality and integrity of the Orion product.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Discovery**: SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of MsBuild.exe to detect the targeted Visual Studio solution build.
2. **Impact**: Once the targeted build process is detected, SUNSPOT replaces a source file to include the SUNBURST backdoor code.

Given the sequence described in the report, it is clear that the monitoring of MsBuild.exe (Discovery) is a precursor to the modification of the Orion source code (Impact).
