### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
- The attack resembles previous attacks against the global financial network SWIFT.

**Resource Development:**
- Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain similar to the cryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin.
- The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created and updated before the implants appeared.

**Execution:**
- The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx).
- The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.

**Persistence:**
- Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim's network for further exploitation.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The implant is designed to evade detection and can wipe files to erase evidence.

**Command and Control:**
- The implants communicate with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.

**Others:**
- The campaign is successful against unpatched Flash versions.
- Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that Hidden Cobra would target financial organizations with spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents before executing the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Reconnaissance:** Identify and target financial organizations.
2. **Resource Development:** Create and use a domain similar to a legitimate cryptocurrency platform.
3. **Execution:** Send a malicious Word document with an embedded Flash exploit.
4. **Persistence:** Ensure the Bankshot implant persists on the victim's network.
5. **Defense Evasion:** Evade detection and wipe files to erase evidence.
6. **Command and Control:** Communicate with control servers.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report clearly states that the Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document (Agreement.docx) and that the document contains an embedded Flash script to exploit CVE-2018-4878.
  - The report also mentions that the campaign targets financial organizations and uses spear phishing techniques.
  - This aligns with the sequence described in the question.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that Hidden Cobra does not use spear phishing emails with malicious Word documents to deliver the Bankshot implant, which contradicts the information in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly mentions that the Bankshot implant is delivered via a malicious Word document with an embedded Flash exploit.
- The report also indicates that the target is financial organizations, and the use of spear phishing is a common method for delivering such malware.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that Hidden Cobra would use spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Word documents to execute the Bankshot implant through a Flash exploit.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
