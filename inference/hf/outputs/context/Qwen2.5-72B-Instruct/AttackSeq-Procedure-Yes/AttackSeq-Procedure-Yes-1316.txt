### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CosmicDuke uses document-based exploits (malicious PDF files with embedded Flash objects) and social engineering to deceive victims into opening the files.
     - The exploit targets the CVE-2011-0611 vulnerability in Adobe Flash, Reader, and Acrobat products.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
     - The loader was updated, and CosmicDuke began using the updated loader in mid-April 2014.
   - **Persistence:**
     - CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service' and a Windows service named 'javamtsup' to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Discovery:**
     - CosmicDuke searches for specific file patterns on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Collection:**
     - The malware collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
     - It also searches removable drives for files.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The collected information is uploaded to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to collect information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing before communicating with remote servers via FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updating.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:**
     - The report confirms that CosmicDuke uses document-based exploits and social engineering to gain initial access.
     - The malware then executes using updated loaders inherited from MiniDuke.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report explicitly states that CosmicDuke collects information using a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report confirms that the collected information is exfiltrated via FTP.
     - The question mentions both FTP and WebDav, but the report only mentions FTP. However, the presence of FTP is sufficient to align with the question.
   - **Updating:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention updating, but the use of updated loaders and the continuous nature of the attack suggest that updating is a plausible activity.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access and execution steps are clearly described in the report.
   - The collection of information through keylogging, screenshotting, and clipboard stealing is explicitly mentioned.
   - The exfiltration of collected information via FTP is also confirmed.
   - While the report does not mention WebDav, the presence of FTP is sufficient to align with the question.
   - The continuous nature of the attack and the use of updated loaders suggest that updating is a plausible activity.
