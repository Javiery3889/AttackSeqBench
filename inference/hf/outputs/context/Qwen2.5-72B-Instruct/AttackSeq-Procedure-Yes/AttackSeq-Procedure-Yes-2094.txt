### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The Inception Framework used RTF files with embedded malware, exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158. These files were distributed via spear phishing emails.
- **Others**: The attackers used a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts for operational security. They showed interest in various sectors and used sophisticated malware with multiple layers of obfuscation. They also targeted mobile devices with malware disguised as updates and MMS phishing content.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers leveraged a cloud service for their command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using the WebDAV protocol after gaining initial access through the described methods.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Initial Access**: The report clearly states that the initial access was gained through spear phishing emails with weaponized RTF documents exploiting specific vulnerabilities.
- **C2 Infrastructure**: The report mentions that the attackers used a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts for operational security. It does not explicitly mention the use of cloud services or the WebDAV protocol for C2 infrastructure.
- **Sophistication and Adaptability**: The attackers demonstrated a high level of operational security and sophistication, which suggests they could use various methods to maintain C2, including cloud services. However, the report does not provide specific evidence of using cloud services or WebDAV.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  - The report emphasizes the use of a complex network of router proxies and rented hosts for operational security.
  - While the attackers are sophisticated and could potentially use cloud services, the report does not provide any direct evidence of this.
  - The use of WebDAV for C2 is not mentioned in the report, and there is no indication that it was a preferred method for the attackers.
- **Conclusion**:
  - Given the lack of specific evidence in the report, it is not likely that the attackers leveraged a cloud service for their C2 infrastructure using the WebDAV protocol.

**Final Answer: B: No**
