### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities and SQL injection.
- Successful exploitation led to the uploading of webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Execution:**
- Agrius deployed a custom .NET backdoor named 'IPsec Helper' for data exfiltration and deploying additional malware.
- The backdoor was registered as a service for persistence and could execute commands, upload files, and update its configuration based on commands from C2 servers.

**Persistence:**
- Agrius achieved persistence by deploying webshells and registering 'IPsec Helper' as a service.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Agrius used webshells with variations of ASPXSpy, some of which were obfuscated.
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor had functionality to update its engine and delete traces of itself.

**Command and Control:**
- The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, based on a configuration file containing encrypted server addresses.
- The malware awaited commands from these relays, which included updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.

**Impact:**
- Agrius deployed wipers like 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD to destroy data on targeted systems.
- 'Apostle' initially failed to execute properly but was later turned into functioning ransomware.
- DEADWOOD was used to overwrite files with random data and could be executed in service or Windows application mode.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if Agrius is likely to use webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report states that Agrius exploited public-facing applications to gain initial access and uploaded webshells for lateral movement using RDP.

**Lateral Movement:**
- The report mentions that webshells were used for lateral movement, which aligns with the use of webshells for tunneling RDP traffic.

**Command and Control:**
- The report states that the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP, which aligns with the communication method mentioned in the question.

**Sequence of TTPs:**
- The sequence described in the question (using webshells for tunneling RDP traffic and leveraging compromised accounts for lateral movement before communicating with C2 servers using the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor over HTTP) is consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Initial Access:** Agrius exploited public-facing applications to gain initial access.
- **Lateral Movement:** Webshells were used for lateral movement, which can include tunneling RDP traffic.
- **Command and Control:** The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.

Given the alignment of the attack sequence in the CTI report with the sequence described in the question, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
