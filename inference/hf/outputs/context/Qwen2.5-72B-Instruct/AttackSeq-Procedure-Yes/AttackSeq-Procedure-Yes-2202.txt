### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various tools and commands to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing User Account Control (UAC).
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will target user credentials using tools like procdump and Mimikatz after scanning for machines in the target's network environment.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement Phase:** The report states that Earth Lusca engaged in lateral movement by exploiting remote services and using internal spear phishing.
   - **Privilege Escalation and Credential Access:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of procdump or Mimikatz. However, it does mention techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms and hijacking execution flow to gain higher-level permissions, which are often associated with credential access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to Lateral Movement:** After discovering machines in the network, it is common for threat actors to target user credentials to facilitate lateral movement. Tools like procdump and Mimikatz are frequently used to extract credentials from memory.
   - **Contextual Information:** While the report does not explicitly state the use of procdump and Mimikatz, the techniques mentioned (abuse of elevation control mechanisms, hijacking execution flow) suggest that credential access is a likely step in their attack sequence.
   - **Logical Sequence:** The logical sequence of actions would be to discover machines, then target credentials to gain access to those machines, and finally exploit remote services for lateral movement.
