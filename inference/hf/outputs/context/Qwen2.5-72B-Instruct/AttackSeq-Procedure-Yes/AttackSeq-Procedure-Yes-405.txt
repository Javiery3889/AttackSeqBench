### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Gholee malware campaign used a spear phishing attack with a malicious Excel file named 'Operation Protective Edge.xlsb'.
- The file was not initially detected as malicious by any antivirus engines but was later detected by Kaspersky.

**Execution:**
- Upon enabling Macro content, the victim is presented with a message that disappears to show different content.
- The Macro code uses ASCII character codes to avoid detection and concatenates them into a single variable.
- The functions are combined to create a single PE file, which is saved and executed using ShellExecute under cmd.exe /C and Rundll32.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware employs obfuscation and includes mechanisms to hide from debuggers and sandbox software.
- The entry point is named 'gholee', which is the name of a popular Iranian singer.

**Others:**
- Another file 'svchost 67.exe' communicated with an IP address (83.170.33.37) in the same netblock as the Gholee malware.
- Detection and prevention measures include disabling macro code via GPO, blocking files containing macro code at the email gateway, and monitoring logs and proxy servers for communication with the malware-associated IP addresses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After obfuscating its entry point to evade defense mechanisms such as debuggers or sandbox software, is the Gholee malware likely to establish communication with an IP address, use an expired digital certificate, and send HTTP communication to perform Command and Control operations?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware uses obfuscation to evade detection.
- It communicates with an IP address (83.170.33.37) in the same netblock.
- There is no mention of using an expired digital certificate.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The malware does establish communication with an IP address.
  - The report does not mention the use of an expired digital certificate.
  - The malware sends HTTP communication to perform Command and Control operations (implied by the communication with the IP address).

- **B: No**
  - The malware does not use an expired digital certificate (as not mentioned in the report).

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report confirms that the Gholee malware establishes communication with an IP address and uses HTTP communication for Command and Control operations.
- The report does not mention the use of an expired digital certificate, which is a critical part of the question.
- Since the question asks if the malware is likely to perform all three actions (establish communication, use an expired digital certificate, and send HTTP communication), and one of these actions (using an expired digital certificate) is not supported by the report, the correct answer is "No."

**Final Answer: B: No**
