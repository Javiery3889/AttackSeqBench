### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report mentions that TG1021 used publicly available offensive security tools (OST) like SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance. These tools were loaded directly into memory without writing the binary on the disk.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a sophisticated memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework that operates almost entirely in-memory. They also removed all disk-resident tools after use.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom versions of tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded commercial EDRs, and removed disk-resident tools to maintain stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to scan and map targets, loading them directly into memory.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader.
   - **Command and Control:** TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 performed reconnaissance using tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory before gaining initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and that these tools were loaded directly into memory without writing the binary on the disk.
   - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that reconnaissance would be performed before gaining initial access to understand the target environment.
   - The use of memory-resident tools for reconnaissance aligns with the threat actor's focus on stealth and avoiding detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report confirms that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit for reconnaissance.
   - **Memory-Resident Tools:** The report specifies that these tools were loaded directly into memory to avoid detection.
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that TG1021 exploited internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - **Logical Sequence:** It is logical to assume that reconnaissance would be performed before gaining initial access to understand the target environment and identify vulnerabilities.
