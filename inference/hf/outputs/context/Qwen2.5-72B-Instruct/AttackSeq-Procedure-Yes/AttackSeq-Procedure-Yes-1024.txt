### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Gamaredonâ€™s malware will search for sensitive documents during the collection phase after injecting malicious macros into all accessible Word and Excel documents for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that Gamaredon injects malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report indicates that after lateral movement (injecting malicious macros into documents), the malware will likely search for and list interesting files (Discovery phase).
   - The Discovery phase is crucial for identifying sensitive documents that can be exfiltrated.
   - The Exfiltration phase follows, where the harvested documents are uploaded to the C&C server.
