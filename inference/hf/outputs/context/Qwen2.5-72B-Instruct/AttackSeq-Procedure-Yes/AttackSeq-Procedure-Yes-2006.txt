### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Adversaries gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture.
     - They use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices, enumeration of devices, and social media data collection.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Adversaries initiate a phishing campaign against electricity distributors.
     - They deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) via weaponized MS Office email attachments.
     - Employees open the attachments and enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - After installation, the malware establishes a connection from the malicious implant on the targeted network to the attacker-controlled Command and Control (C2) server.
     - This connection is established as part of the execution routine following the installation of the malicious files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that malicious implants like BlackEnergy 3 will establish communication with Command-and-Control servers after being installed on the network through employee-enabled macro execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that after the installation of BlackEnergy 3 via employee-enabled macro execution, the malware establishes a connection to the attacker-controlled C2 server.
   - This connection is part of the execution routine of the malware, which is consistent with the behavior of many types of malware, including RATs.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The adversaries gather information and conduct active discovery to understand the target network.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - They use a phishing campaign to deliver a weaponized MS Office file.
     - Employees enable macros, leading to the installation of BlackEnergy 3.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report explicitly states that the malware establishes a connection to the C2 server after installation.
     - This is a critical step for the adversaries to maintain control over the infected systems and to deliver additional payloads or commands.
