     - These codes are transmitted to C2 servers along with the stolen credentials.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN4 employs spearphishing emails to gain initial access.
     - They embed VBA macros into legitimate documents that prompt users for their Outlook credentials.
     - They also use fake OWA login pages to capture credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - FIN4 creates rules in victims' Outlook accounts to delete emails containing specific keywords.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - FIN4 uses C2 servers to collect stolen credentials.
     - They use domains and Tor for anonymous communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN4 will use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials after labeling the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes'.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - FIN4 labels the origin of stolen credentials using unique 'campaign codes' and transmits these codes to C2 servers.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - FIN4 uses spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for Outlook credentials.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The CTI report indicates that FIN4 first organizes their targets using 'campaign codes' (Resource Development).
     - After organizing, they use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to gain initial access and capture credentials.
     - These credentials are then transmitted to C2 servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that FIN4 uses 'campaign codes' to label the origin of stolen credentials.
   - After labeling, they use spearphishing emails with embedded VBA macros to prompt victims for their Outlook credentials.
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report aligns with the sequence described in the question.
