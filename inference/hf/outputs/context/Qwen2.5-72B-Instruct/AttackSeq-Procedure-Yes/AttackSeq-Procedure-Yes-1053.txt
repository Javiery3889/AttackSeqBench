### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks, using advanced reconnaissance to know victims' whereabouts.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They use malware posing as legitimate software updates and seed P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy malware components like small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use digital certificates to sign backdoors and encrypt gathered data.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They encrypt and store gathered data in log files and collect various secrets.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will maintain persistence on compromised systems using autorun registry settings and malware after deploying malware components.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of autorun registry settings for persistence. However, maintaining persistence is a common tactic in advanced APTs to ensure long-term access to compromised systems.
   - **Malware Deployment:** The report mentions the deployment of small downloaders, information stealers, and advanced keyloggers, which are typical components used to maintain persistence and gather data.
   - **Contextual Information:** The APT's long-term operations and sophisticated infrastructure suggest they are likely to use multiple techniques to maintain access, including persistence mechanisms.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the advanced nature of the Darkhotel APT and their long-term operations, it is highly likely that they would use persistence mechanisms to ensure they can maintain access to compromised systems over time.
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of autorun registry settings, the deployment of malware components and the APT's sophisticated capabilities strongly suggest that they would employ such techniques to maintain persistence.
