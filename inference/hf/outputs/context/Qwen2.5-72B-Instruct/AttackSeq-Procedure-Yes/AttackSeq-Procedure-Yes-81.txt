### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - OnionDog malware is transmitted by exploiting a vulnerability in the Hangul office software.
     - It also uses a USB worm to attack network-isolated targets.
     - Darkweb communication tools (Onion City) are used to hide the attacker's identity in the Tor network.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - OnionDog uses USB disk drives to break the physical isolation of intranet-isolated networks.
     - It generates USB worms to infiltrate the target internal network.
   - **Others:**
     - OnionDog has been active since October 2013, with a focus on infrastructure industries in Korean-language countries.
     - It uses a 15-day average lifecycle for its attacks.
     - Communication with C&C servers is upgraded to use Onion City, which allows communication through the Tor network without the need for the Tor browser.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after infiltrating the target internal network through a USB worm, OnionDog is likely to establish communication with a C&C server and download other malware using the OnionDog Trojan for further operations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Defense Evasion:**
     - The report clearly states that OnionDog uses a USB worm to infiltrate network-isolated targets.
     - It also mentions that OnionDog uses darkweb communication tools (Onion City) to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The report indicates that OnionDog uses Onion City to hide the Trojan-controlling server in the Tor network.
     - This suggests that once the malware is inside the network, it is likely to establish communication with the C&C server.
   - **Further Operations:**
     - The report does not explicitly state that OnionDog downloads other malware, but it is a common practice in APT attacks to download additional malware for further operations once the initial foothold is established.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Infiltration:**
     - OnionDog uses a USB worm to infiltrate the target internal network.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - Once inside the network, it is likely to establish communication with the C&C server using Onion City.
   - **Further Operations:**
     - Given the nature of APT attacks and the sophistication of OnionDog, it is reasonable to assume that it would download additional malware for further operations.
