### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Yellow Garuda is known for spoofing login pages and using Android malware.
   - **Initial Access:** Macro-enabled template files for initial access, hosted on third-party services like Dropbox or AWS.
   - **Persistence:** Replacing the victim's default Microsoft Word template.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Using RC4-encrypted strings and remote decryption keys.
   - **Credential Access:** Extensive credential harvesting via dedicated phishing sites and a Telegram 'grabber' tool.
   - **Collection:** The Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data from victims' Telegram accounts.
   - **Others:** OPSEC mistakes leading to the disclosure of tools and procedures.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool (messages, media, group memberships, and contact data) are exfiltrated over the web and stored in SQLite database and JSON format.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Details from the Report:**
     - The report states that the Telegram 'grabber' tool collects messages, media, group memberships, and contact data.
     - The exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format.
   - **Exfiltration Method:**
     - The report does not explicitly state how the data is exfiltrated, but it is reasonable to infer that the data is exfiltrated over the web, given the nature of the tool and the threat actor's capabilities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that the data collected by the Telegram 'grabber' tool is stored in both SQLite database and JSON format.
   - Given the threat actor's history of using web-based methods for various activities (e.g., hosting malicious documents on third-party services), it is highly likely that the data is exfiltrated over the web.
