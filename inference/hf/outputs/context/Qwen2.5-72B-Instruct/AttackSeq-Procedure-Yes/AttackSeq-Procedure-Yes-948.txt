### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Sednit group used spearphishing emails with shortened URLs to deliver the first stage of Zebrocy components. The URL led to an IP-address-based URL where the archived payload was located, containing an executable file and a decoy PDF document.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor and began sending commands immediately after the victim executed the downloader. They used a Stage-1 downloader to download and execute a new downloader, which then downloaded a Delphi backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The operators used COM object hijacking for persistence and added registry keys for a custom backdoor.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware deleted files and killed processes to disable security tools.
   - **Credential Access:** The operators used dumpers to target browsers and email clients to retrieve credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The operators gathered information about the victim's computer and environment.
   - **Collection:** The malware scanned for files matching specific extensions and staged data for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data were prepared with file paths and sent to the C&C server, hex-encoded and encrypted with a known algorithm or a custom one.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Sednit group is likely to encrypt network traffic with AES or a custom algorithm for secure communication with its C&C server in the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the data were "hex-encoded and encrypted with a known algorithm or a custom one" during the exfiltration phase.
   - The report does not specify whether AES is one of the known algorithms used.
   - However, the use of a custom algorithm is mentioned, which suggests that the Sednit group is capable of using custom encryption methods.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the Sednit group uses encryption for secure communication with the C&C server.
   - The encryption method is described as either a known algorithm or a custom one.
   - Since the report mentions the use of a custom algorithm, it is plausible that the Sednit group would use a custom algorithm for encrypting network traffic.
