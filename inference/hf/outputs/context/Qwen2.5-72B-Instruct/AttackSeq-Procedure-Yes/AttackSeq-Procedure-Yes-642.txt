### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Both Moafee and DragonOK use similar TTPs and tools.
     - They employ custom-built backdoors and RATs like CT/NewCT, Mongall, and Nflog, as well as publicly available RATs like PoisonIvy.
     - They use HTRAN to disguise their geographical location.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The primary attack vector is spear-phishing emails.
     - Emails are well-crafted and tailored to the target audience.
     - Attachments are typically executable files in ZIP archives or password-protected Microsoft Office documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Evasion techniques include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents.
     - The first-stage payload for RATs (CT/NewCT) uses a 'CPU core check' to detect the number of processor cores and avoid detection in virtualized environments.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Registry entries are used to ensure startup persistence.
     - The implant creates a registry entry file called 'Windows.reg' and imports it using 'regedit.exe /s Windows.reg'.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Techniques include environment-based evasion, large file sizes, and password-protected documents.
     - The 'CPU core check' technique is used to detect virtualized environments.
     - Large null-padded files are used to evade detection by AV engines.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The NewCT RAT uses a 'POST' network beacon with hardcoded header values and encrypted data.
     - The implant has plugin functionality for additional payloads.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Moafee and DragonOK will use custom-built backdoors and RATs during resource development before using environment-based evasion techniques like CPU core checks to execute their payloads.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the primary attack vector is spear-phishing emails.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - The report mentions the use of custom-built backdoors and RATs (CT/NewCT, Mongall, Nflog, PoisonIvy) to maintain access to victim networks.
   - **Execution and Defense Evasion:**
     - The report details the use of environment-based evasion techniques, including the 'CPU core check' to detect virtualized environments.
     - The 'CPU core check' is used to avoid detection in sandboxes, which is a critical step in the execution phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs:**
     1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails are used to gain initial access.
     2. **Resource Development:** Custom-built backdoors and RATs are deployed to maintain access.
     3. **Execution and Defense Evasion:** Environment-based evasion techniques, such as the 'CPU core check,' are used to execute the payloads and avoid detection.
   - **Logical Flow:**
     - The use of custom-built backdoors and RATs is a necessary step to maintain access and establish a foothold in the network.
     - The environment-based evasion techniques, including the 'CPU core check,' are used to ensure that the payloads are executed without being detected by security systems.
