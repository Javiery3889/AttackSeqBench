### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT and passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT are used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are used for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities are used for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass are used to obtain credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR are used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from network shared drives and staged locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols are used for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance after gaining credentials via memory dumping LSASS and network sniffing, before using WMI for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that FIN13 uses LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing to obtain credentials.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** The report mentions that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials, which implies internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report specifies that FIN13 uses WMI for lateral movement.
   - **Native OS Binaries and Scripts:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance. However, it is a common practice in the cyber threat landscape for threat actors to use native tools for reconnaissance to avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Credential Access:** FIN13 gains credentials using LSASS memory dumping and network sniffing.
   - **Internal Reconnaissance:** Given their long-term intrusions and focus on mapping victim networks, it is highly likely that FIN13 would use native OS binaries and scripts for internal reconnaissance to gather information on user accounts and network structure.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After gathering the necessary information, FIN13 would use WMI for lateral movement.
