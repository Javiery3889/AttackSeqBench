### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - WinDealer executes by reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - It loads a DLL module into memory.
     - It steals information from the victim's PC, including network configuration and SNS application details.
     - It saves stolen data with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files are encoded using XOR with the key "b6a7%7486".
     - Communication with C2 servers is encrypted using AES and RSA.
     - Stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - Collects data from SNS applications.
     - Stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     - Encrypts an AES key with RSA and sends it to the C2 server.
     - Receives commands from the C2 server and executes them.
     - Sends results back to the C2 server after encryption.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.
   - **Others:**
     - Targets Korean and Japanese organizations.
     - Monitors and processes data from USB memory, documents, desktop, recycle bin, and SNS application folders.
     - Configuration is stored in several folders under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - Uses a hardcoded RSA1024bit public key for encryption.
     - DLL module named "MozillaDll.dll" has export functions for stealing data, setting configuration, and initiating commands.
     - Monitors items such as files stored in USB memory and folders related to SNS applications, saving related items in separate files to be sent to a C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that WinDealer will collect data from removable media and target relevant folders before exfiltrating the processed and encrypted data to the C2 server, after discovering information about the infected PC and network configuration and staging encrypted stolen data in the `%TEMP%` folder.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report states that WinDealer discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration and collects data from SNS applications.
     - It stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report mentions that WinDealer exfiltrates stolen data to a C2 server after processing and encrypting it.
     - Data is sent from the `%TEMP%` directory where it is staged as ".a" files.
   - **Additional Information:**
     - The malware monitors and processes data from USB memory, documents, desktop, recycle bin, and SNS application folders.
     - It saves related items in separate files to be sent to a C2 server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that WinDealer collects data from various sources, including removable media and relevant folders.
   - After discovering information and staging it in the `%TEMP%` folder, the malware processes and encrypts the data before exfiltrating it to the C2 server.
   - The additional information about monitoring and processing data from USB memory and relevant folders aligns with the question's scenario.
