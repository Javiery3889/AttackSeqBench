### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Darkhotel APT targets specific hotel and business center Wi-Fi networks to compromise guests' devices. They have advanced reconnaissance capabilities, including knowledge of victims' names and places of stay.
   - **Resource Development:** They compromise trusted commercial network resources globally, possess advanced crypto-analytical capabilities, and maintain a dynamic infrastructure.
   - **Initial Access:** They gain initial access by posing as legitimate software updates and seeding P2P sites with malware.
   - **Execution:** They deploy various malware components, including small downloaders, information stealers, and keyloggers, and use 0-day exploits.
   - **Persistence:** They maintain persistence through autorun registry settings and selective infector viruses.
   - **Credential Access:** They target stored secrets in browsers and email services.
   - **Collection:** They use keyloggers and information stealers to collect and encrypt data.
   - **Command and Control:** They maintain a web interface for victim management and encrypt victim data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Darkhotel APT will use small downloaders and zero-day exploits to execute malicious code before employing techniques such as signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** The report mentions that the Darkhotel APT compromises trusted commercial network resources and has advanced crypto-analytical capabilities, which suggests they can undermine the trust in Certificate Authorities and PKI.
   - **Execution:** The report states that they use small downloaders and 0-day exploits to execute malicious code.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report does not explicitly mention signing backdoors with digital certificates, but the ability to undermine trust in Certificate Authorities and PKI implies they could use such techniques for defense evasion.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Darkhotel APT has a well-documented sequence of actions that includes compromising trusted resources, using small downloaders and 0-day exploits for initial access and execution, and maintaining persistence and credential access.
   - The report's mention of advanced crypto-analytical capabilities and the ability to undermine trust in Certificate Authorities and PKI strongly suggests that they could use techniques like signing backdoors with digital certificates for defense evasion.
   - The logical sequence of events would be to first gain initial access and execute malicious code using small downloaders and 0-day exploits, and then employ more sophisticated techniques like signing backdoors for defense evasion to maintain long-term access and avoid detection.
