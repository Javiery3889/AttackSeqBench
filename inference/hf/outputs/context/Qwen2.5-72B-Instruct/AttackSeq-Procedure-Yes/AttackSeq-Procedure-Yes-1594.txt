### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. It used a multi-stage execution process involving shellcode and a temporary file.
   - **Execution:** The malware used a legitimate Microsoft executable (igfxtray.exe) to sideload a malicious DLL (hccutils.dll), which performed security product checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence through registry key modifications and process injection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware was designed to evade detection by customizing its installation and using multi-stage checks.
   - **Collection:** T9000 captured data about the infected system, stole files from removable media, and targeted Skype users, capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and communications.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to compress and encrypt the stolen data for exfiltration over a C2 channel after the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report states that T9000 captures data about the infected system, steals files from removable media, and targets Skype users, capturing encrypted data, screenshots, and communications.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The report mentions that the malware communicates with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port, sending encrypted traffic.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** While the report does not explicitly state that the data is compressed, it does mention that the traffic is encrypted. Given the nature of the malware and its focus on evading detection, it is highly likely that the data would be compressed to reduce the size and make exfiltration more efficient and less noticeable.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection:** T9000 collects a significant amount of data, including encrypted data, screenshots, and communications.
   - **Data Encryption:** The report clearly states that the traffic sent to the C2 server is encrypted.
   - **Data Compression:** While not explicitly mentioned, compressing the data before exfiltration is a common practice in malware to reduce the size of the data and make it less detectable. Given the malware's focus on evasion and efficiency, it is reasonable to assume that data compression is part of the exfiltration process.
   - **C2 Communication:** The malware uses a binary protocol over a specified port, which is consistent with the need for efficient and secure data transfer.
