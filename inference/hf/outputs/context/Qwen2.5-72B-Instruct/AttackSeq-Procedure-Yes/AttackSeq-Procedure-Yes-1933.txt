### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Smooth Operator malware is distributed via a supply chain attack involving 3CX software.
     - The infected software package is signed by 3CX and notarized by Apple.
     - Malicious code is inserted into a dynamic library (dylib) within the 3CX software.
     - The dylib downloads and executes a second-stage payload.
   - **Execution:**
     - Smooth Operator executes as part of the 3CX software.
     - It creates a new thread to run its functionality.
     - It uses a constructor function within the dylib to initiate without affecting the normal usage of the library.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process.
     - It deletes itself from disk immediately after execution.
     - The malware writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate.
     - Traffic to the C2 server is obfuscated with a custom data encoding algorithm.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Smooth Operator collects information from the victim machine, including OS version, domain, and account name values.
   - **Collection:**
     - Smooth Operator stages collect data from the victim machine to be included in a beacon or exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Smooth Operator communicates with its C2 servers over HTTPS, using a custom data encoding algorithm.
     - It contains multiple C2 servers and randomly chooses a new server for each beacon.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Smooth Operator automatically exfiltrates collected data via a HTTP GET request over HTTPS.
   - **Others:**
     - Smooth Operator targets macOS and infects victims when they install specific trojanised versions of the 3CX software.
     - It implements a file lock to ensure only one instance is running.
     - It generates a unique victim ID.
     - The malware sleeps for 7 to 20 days before beaconing.
     - It uses a time-seeded random algorithm to generate beacon intervals.
     - It has an embedded list of 15 C2s and one URL for the 3CX website, all obfuscated.
     - The malware maintains a beacon error count and has taskable functionality supported by command IDs.
     - The second-stage payload is lightweight and likely meant to determine which victims to pursue with further stages.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Smooth Operator is likely to persist by abusing the legitimate 3CX software package and ensuring execution every time `libffmpeg.dylib` is loaded before employing defense evasion techniques such as daemonizing the second-stage payload UpdateAgent and writing configuration files to the 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention persistence mechanisms, but it does state that the malware writes configuration files and executable stages to the legitimate 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate. This suggests that the malware is attempting to persist by integrating with the legitimate 3CX software.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware executes as part of the 3CX software and creates a new thread to run its functionality.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The second-stage payload, UpdateAgent, daemonizes and detaches from the 3CX process.
     - It writes configuration files to the 3CX installation directory to appear legitimate.
   - **Loading `libffmpeg.dylib`:**
     - The report mentions that the malicious code is inserted into a dynamic library (dylib) within the 3CX software, which implies that the malware is likely to execute every time this library is loaded.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence presented in the CTI report. The malware does persist by integrating with the legitimate 3CX software, ensures execution every time the dylib is loaded, and employs defense evasion techniques such as daemonizing the second-stage payload and writing configuration files to the 3CX installation directory.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
