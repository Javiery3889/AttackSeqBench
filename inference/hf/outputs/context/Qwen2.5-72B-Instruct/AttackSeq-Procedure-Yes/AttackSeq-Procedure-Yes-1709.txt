### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Turla spyware has been infecting government computers, indicating an Initial Access tactic.
   - **Persistence:** The malware establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks, allowing persistent access to search other computers, store stolen information, and transmit data back to servers.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Turla uses encryption and a rootkit to hide its tracks and maintain control of infected networks.
   - **Command and Control:** Turla uses multiple command and control servers worldwide to control infected systems, with regular code updates to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Turla operators will use tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems (e.g., programs for gathering system information) before updating command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Turla establishes a hidden foothold and uses an encrypted file system to store stolen data and tools. This aligns with the idea that Turla operators would use tools stored in the encrypted file system to collect data from local systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The report also states that Turla uses multiple command and control servers worldwide and regularly updates the code to avoid detection. This aligns with the idea of updating command and control servers to maintain control of infected systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks (Persistence).
   - **Step 2:** Turla uses an encrypted file system to store stolen data and tools (Defense Evasion).
   - **Step 3:** Turla operators are likely to use these tools to collect data from local systems (Data Collection).
   - **Step 4:** Turla updates command and control servers worldwide to maintain control of infected systems (Command and Control).
