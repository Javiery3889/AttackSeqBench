### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attackers used spear phishing with documents containing exploits for known vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, and CVE-2012-0158) to gain initial access.
- The spear phishing documents were customized for the victims, with the executable replaced by the attackers' own code.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers created a multi-functional framework capable of quick feature extension for intelligence gathering.
- The system is resistant to C&C server takeover and allows recovery access to infected machines using alternative communication channels.
- The attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to actively scan the local area network, find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067, or accessible with admin credentials from their password database.

**Command and Control:**
- The C&C infrastructure is a chain of servers working as proxies to hide the true command and control server.
- The attackers created more than 60 domain names and several server hosting locations in different countries, mainly Germany and Russia, to control the network of infected machines.
- The C&C infrastructure's complexity rivals that of the Flame malware.

**Others:**
- The campaign has been active for at least five years, targeting diplomatic, governmental, and scientific research organizations.
- The attackers have Russian-speaking origins and have created a sophisticated multi-functional framework for intelligence gathering.
- The malware targets not only workstations but also mobile devices and network equipment.
- The attackers have used at least three different exploits for previously known vulnerabilities and have a high degree of interaction with the victims' networks.
- Kaspersky Lab has identified several hundred infections worldwide, with the majority in Eastern Europe, North America, and Western European countries.
- The campaign has infected hundreds of victims in eight main categories, including government, diplomatic, research institutions, and military.
- The attackers' malware modules have been created by Russian-speaking operatives and have not been used in any other operations.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using their multi-functional framework to evade defenses via alternative communication channels and explore the local area network using admin credentials for scanning, is it likely that the Rocra attackers will utilize a module to find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 or infect remote hosts during lateral movement?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers deployed a module during lateral movement to actively scan the local area network.
- The module is used to find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 or accessible with admin credentials from their password database.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that the attackers used a module to find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 during lateral movement.
- This module is part of their multi-functional framework, which is designed to evade defenses and explore the local area network.
- The use of such a module aligns with the attackers' goal of extending their presence within the network and gaining access to additional hosts.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly indicates that the attackers used a module to find hosts vulnerable to MS08-067 during lateral movement.
2. This module is part of their multi-functional framework, which is designed to evade defenses and explore the local area network.
3. The use of such a module is consistent with the attackers' sophisticated and multi-faceted approach to maintaining and extending their presence within the network.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
