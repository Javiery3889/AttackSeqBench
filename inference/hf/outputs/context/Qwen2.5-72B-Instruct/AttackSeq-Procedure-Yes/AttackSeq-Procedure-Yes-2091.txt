### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Carbanak group collected data related to banking applications and internal procedures after business hours or on weekends.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and documents, leading to the download of a Cobalt Strike beacon.
   - **Execution:** The attackers downloaded and executed new payloads, ran shell commands, and deleted files to minimize forensic traces.
   - **Persistence:** A backdoor from the Command and Control (C2) server was established.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers obtained admin-level credentials, compromising a Domain Administrator account.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Operations were performed outside business hours, and a single workstation was used as a hub for communication with the C2 server.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers compromised a Domain Administrator account and used it to compromise at least two more endpoints.
   - **Discovery:** The Cobalt Strike beacon was used to discover and map the internal network, collect administrative credentials, and compromise additional endpoints.
   - **Collection:** Valuable documents were collected and prepared for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike beacon facilitated communication with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** Documents related to internal applications and procedures were prepared for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after discovering and mapping the internal network and collecting administrative-level credentials, the attackers are likely to move laterally across the infrastructure, compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Credential Access:** The report states that the attackers used the Cobalt Strike beacon to discover and map the internal network and collect administrative-level credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the attackers compromised at least two more endpoints by the end of the first day, indicating that they did move laterally.
   - **Targeting Internal Hosts and Servers:** The report also indicates that the attackers used the compromised Domain Administrator account to move across the entire infrastructure, which suggests they targeted internal hosts and servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Carbanak group's use of the Cobalt Strike beacon for discovery and credential access aligns with the question's premise.
   - The report explicitly states that the attackers compromised additional endpoints and moved laterally, which supports the likelihood of them compromising numerous workstations and targeting internal hosts and servers.
   - The use of a Domain Administrator account and the establishment of a backdoor for persistence further reinforce the attackers' ability to move laterally and target internal infrastructure.
