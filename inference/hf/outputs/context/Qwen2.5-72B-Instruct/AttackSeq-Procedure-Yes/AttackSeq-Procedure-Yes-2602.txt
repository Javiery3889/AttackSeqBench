### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actor used spearphishing emails with XLS or DOC attachments containing VBA macros to deliver the NanHaiShu malware.
   - **Execution:** The VBA macro decodes and runs, writes JScript data to a file, and executes it. It also saves a decoy XLS file and sets up a VBScript to delete the original file.
   - **Persistence:** The malware modifies the registry to ensure it starts automatically.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses base64 encoding and obfuscation to hide its components.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware can receive and execute additional scripts for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NanHaiShu is likely to communicate with C&C servers using dynamic DNS providers before using HTTP POST to upload encoded system information.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Exfiltration:** The report states that NanHaiShu gathers system information and uploads it to the C&C server. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of dynamic DNS providers.
   - **Communication Method:** The report mentions that the malware uses HTTP POST to upload system information to the C&C server. There is no indication of the use of dynamic DNS providers in the communication process.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the methods used for initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, and exfiltration.
   - The report clearly states that the malware uses HTTP POST to upload system information to the C&C server.
   - There is no mention of dynamic DNS providers being used in the communication process.
   - Given the information provided, it is more likely that the malware directly uses HTTP POST to communicate with the C&C server without the intermediate step of using dynamic DNS providers.
