### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- PROMETHIUM uses trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.

**Execution:**
- The malware is deployed alongside legitimate applications.
- It uses a service for persistence and executes a PowerShell command to reconfigure Windows Defender.

**Persistence:**
- A service is created to launch the C2 contact module upon service startup.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware checks for ESET or BitDefender antivirus before dropping the malware.
- It adds its directories to the Windows Defender exclusions list using a PowerShell command.

**Collection:**
- The malware searches for and exfiltrates Microsoft Office files.
- It uses a document search module to parse the hard drive for files with specific extensions, compresses them into an archive, and encodes the archive before sending it to the C2 server.

**Command and Control:**
- The C2 infrastructure includes around 30 new C2 domains.
- The domains are hardcoded into the malware, and communication is over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After PROMETHIUM searches for and compresses Microsoft Office files into archives using a document search module during the Collection phase, is it likely that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks before exfiltrating them to the C2 server during the Exfiltration phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware compresses the collected Microsoft Office files into an archive.
- The archive is encoded before being sent to the C2 server.

**Analysis:**
- The report explicitly states that the malware compresses the files and encodes the archive before exfiltration.
- However, the report does not mention splitting the archives into chunks.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This choice suggests that the malware will encode the archives with an unusual scheme and split them into chunks. The report confirms encoding but does not mention splitting.
- **B: No** - This choice suggests that the malware will not split the archives into chunks. The report does not provide any information about splitting the archives.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the malware compresses and encodes the archives before exfiltration.
- There is no mention of splitting the archives into chunks.
- Therefore, the most plausible sequence of TTPs based on the report is that the malware will encode the archives but not split them into chunks.

**Final Answer:**
- Final Answer: B: No
