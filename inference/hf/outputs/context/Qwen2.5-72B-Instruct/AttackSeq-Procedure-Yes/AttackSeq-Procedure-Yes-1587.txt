### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** T9000 malware was delivered via an RTF file exploiting CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641. It used a multi-stage execution process involving shellcode and a temporary file.
   - **Execution:** The malware used igfxtray.exe to sideload a malicious DLL, hccutils.dll, which performed security checks and initiated further execution.
   - **Persistence:** T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - **Collection:** The malware captured system data, stole files from removable media, and targeted Skype communications.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicated with a C2 server using a binary protocol over a specified port.
   - **Exfiltration:** T9000 exfiltrated various types of data, including screenshots, Skype communications, and files from removable drives.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether T9000 is likely to create mutexes and named events to avoid detection after achieving persistence and before capturing data from the infected system or Skype communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that T9000 established persistence by modifying registry keys and injecting ResN32.dll into explorer.exe.
   - **Evasion Techniques:** The report mentions that the malware's author took significant measures to avoid detection and analysis by the security community. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of mutexes or named events.
   - **Collection:** The report states that T9000 captures data from the infected system and Skype communications after achieving persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly mention the use of mutexes or named events, it is common for sophisticated malware to use such techniques to avoid detection. Mutexes and named events are often used to ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time, which can help in evading detection by security software.
   - However, the report does not provide any specific evidence that T9000 uses these techniques. Given the focus on other evasion methods and the lack of explicit mention, it is less likely that T9000 specifically uses mutexes and named events in this context.
