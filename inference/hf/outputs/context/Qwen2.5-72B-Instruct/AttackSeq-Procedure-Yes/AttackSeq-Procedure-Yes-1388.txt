### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Malware distribution campaign using Telegram's legitimate features.
- Phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit.
- Mailings with attachments containing malicious macros.

**Execution:**
- Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and autofill form details from browsers.
- Raccoon stealer scans for valid crypto wallets and gains access to configuration files.
- Vidar stealer collects data from browsers, bank card data, crypto wallet files, messages, and more.

**Command and Control:**
- Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using legitimate features of Telegram to avoid detection.
- C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.

**Others:**
- Campaign divided into four stages based on the tools used.
- Domains related to the campaign registered with Cloud2m and Host Africa.
- Attackers distributed samples of another stealer called Vidar using malicious macros and phishing pages.
- Domains used to store the code and collect stolen bank card data were registered during the second wave with the same registrars.
- Attackers experimented with various loaders, including Buer and Smoke loaders.
- Campaign's purpose was to steal payment and user data.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After collecting system and account information as well as crypto wallet data through the Execution phase, is it likely that Raccoon stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers for bypassing blocking and ensuring Defense Evasion before communicating with these C&C servers using Telegram features in the Command and Control phase?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Malware distribution via Telegram, phishing pages, and malicious macros.
2. **Execution:**
   - Raccoon stealer collects system information, account data, bank card data, and crypto wallet data.
3. **Command and Control:**
   - Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram features.
   - C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.

**Evaluation:**
- The report clearly states that the Raccoon stealer communicates with C&C servers using Telegram features to avoid detection.
- The C&C servers are encrypted and distributed through the Telegram channel 'blintick'.
- The sequence described in the question aligns with the report: after collecting data, the stealer makes network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers, which is a form of Defense Evasion.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the Raccoon stealer uses Telegram to communicate with C&C servers and that these servers are encrypted and distributed through a Telegram channel.
- The question asks if it is likely that the stealer will make network requests to a Telegram channel to receive encrypted addresses of C&C servers before communicating with them.
- This aligns with the report's description of the stealer's behavior, as it uses Telegram to avoid detection and ensure Defense Evasion.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
