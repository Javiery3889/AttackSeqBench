### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Packrat targets high-profile political figures, journalists, and others in Latin American countries.
     - Uses malware and phishing to gather information.
     - Creates fake opposition groups and news organizations to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Persistent campaign over seven years.
     - Infrastructure includes 12 different malware command and control domains and over 30 malware samples.
     - Maintains fake online organizations in Venezuela and Ecuador.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses malware and phishing attacks, often through fake organizations.
     - Targets individuals such as Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata.
     - Phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan targeting.
   - **Execution:**
     - Uses various types of malware, primarily COTS RATs such as Cybergate, Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok.
     - Obfuscates malware using tools like an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Malware includes features for persistence and monitoring.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses domains like deyrep24.ddns.net and daynews.sytes.net.
     - Infrastructure hosted with various providers in Latin America, Europe, and the US.
   - **Others:**
     - State sponsorship is likely but not conclusively proven.
     - Lack of technical sophistication and reliance on COTS malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Packrat will use COTS RATs obfuscated with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper during execution before employing runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Packrat uses phishing and fake news organizations to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - Packrat uses COTS RATs such as Cybergate, Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok.
     - These malware families are obfuscated using tools like AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Malware includes features for persistence and monitoring.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Uses various domains and infrastructure to maintain control.

   The report clearly states that Packrat uses COTS RATs and obfuscates them with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper. The use of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques is also mentioned as part of their strategy to bypass defenses.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing and fake news organizations are used to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - COTS RATs are used, and these are obfuscated with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper.
   - **Obfuscation:**
     - The report mentions the use of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques to bypass defenses.

   Given the information in the report, it is clear that Packrat uses COTS RATs and obfuscates them with tools like AutoIt3Wrapper during execution. The use of runtime packers and obfuscation techniques is also part of their strategy to bypass defenses.
