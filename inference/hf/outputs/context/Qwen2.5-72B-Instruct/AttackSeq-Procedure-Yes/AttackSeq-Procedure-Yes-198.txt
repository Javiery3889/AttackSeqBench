### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FamousSparrow achieved Persistence by creating a registry Run key entry and installing SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex after exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities for Initial Access and executing SparrowDoor through cmd.exe.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report confirms that FamousSparrow gained Initial Access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities and used cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor.
   - **Persistence:** The report does not explicitly mention the creation of a registry Run key entry or the installation of SparrowDoor as a service named WSearchIndex. However, achieving persistence is a common tactic in cyberespionage to maintain long-term access to the compromised system.
   - **Common Persistence Techniques:** Creating a registry Run key entry and installing a backdoor as a service are common methods for achieving persistence. Given the sophistication of FamousSparrow, it is plausible that they would use such techniques to ensure they can maintain access to the compromised system.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** Confirmed in the report.
   - **Persistence:** While not explicitly stated, it is a logical next step for a sophisticated group like FamousSparrow to ensure they can maintain access.
   - **Common TTPs:** Creating a registry Run key entry and installing a backdoor as a service are well-known persistence techniques.
