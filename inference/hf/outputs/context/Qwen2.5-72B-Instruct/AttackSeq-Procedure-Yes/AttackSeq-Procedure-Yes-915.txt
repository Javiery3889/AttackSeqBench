### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Tuyul botnet exploits a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) to inject arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Persistence:**
- The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The malware uses a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines.
- It also uses various PHP web shells, including Tiny File Manager and an unknown advanced web shell.

**Command and Control:**
- The botnet uses the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz as its C&C server.
- The C&C server and development servers are protected by Cloudflare.

**Others:**
- The botnet has possible Indonesian attribution.
- The botnet's peak size was 366 victim systems.
- Infected servers are primarily hosted on cloud services such as AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether the Tuyul botnet is likely to execute commands using Perl scripts before maintaining persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access:**
  - The report clearly states that the Tuyul botnet gains initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) to inject arbitrary PHP code on the server.

- **Persistence:**
  - The report states that the Tuyul malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.

- **Command Execution:**
  - The report does not mention the use of Perl scripts for command execution. Instead, it focuses on the use of PHP web shells and a binary version of the malware to evade detection and maintain control.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report does not provide any information about the Tuyul botnet using Perl scripts for command execution.
- The report clearly states that the Tuyul malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron'.
- Therefore, the sequence described in the question, which includes executing commands using Perl scripts before maintaining persistence, is not supported by the information in the CTI report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
