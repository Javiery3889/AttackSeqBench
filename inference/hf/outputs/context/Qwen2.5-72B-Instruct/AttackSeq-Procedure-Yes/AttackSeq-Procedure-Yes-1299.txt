### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email containing an Excel document (T1193).
   - **Execution:** The Excel document exploited CVE-2017-11882 to execute code silently (T1204 - User Execution).
   - **Credential Access:** The dropped PE file, educrety.exe, searched for stored passwords and access tokens in various registry keys using T1003 (Credential Dumping), T1081 (Credentials in Files), and T1214 (Credentials in Registry).
   - **Collection:** The malware collected data from the local system (T1005 - Data from Local System).
   - **Command and Control:** The stolen credentials were sent to a command and control server using common ports and standard application layer protocols (T1043 - Commonly Used Port and T1071 - Standard Application Layer Protocol).
   - **Exfiltration:** The data was encrypted before being exfiltrated (T1002 - Data Encrypted).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack will hide artifacts by employing T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories) before searching for and extracting credentials from the registry or stored files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of T1158 (Hidden Files and Directories).
   - The sequence of TTPs described in the report is:
     1. Initial Access (T1193)
     2. Execution (T1204)
     3. Credential Access (T1003, T1081, T1214)
     4. Collection (T1005)
     5. Command and Control (T1043, T1071)
     6. Exfiltration (T1002)
   - The report focuses on the steps taken to gain initial access, execute code, and extract credentials, but does not indicate any steps to hide artifacts before credential access.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The attack sequence described in the report does not include any mention of hiding artifacts (T1158) before credential access.
   - The primary focus of the attack appears to be on gaining access, executing code, and extracting credentials efficiently.
   - While hiding artifacts is a common technique used by threat actors to avoid detection, the report does not provide evidence that this specific attack employed T1158 before credential access.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
