### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Longhorn uses backdoor Trojans and zero-day vulnerabilities.
- A zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document was used to infect a target with Plexor malware.

**Discovery:**
- Longhorn's malware is built for espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities.
- It uses operational security measures to remain undetected.

**Collection:**
- The malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control and can be customized with additional plugins and modules.
- It is designed for espionage-type operations with capabilities for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.

**Command and Control:**
- Longhorn configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target for C&C servers.
- The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering VPS or web hosting services.
- The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.

**Exfiltration:**
- Longhorn's malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Others:**
- Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn's tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group.
- Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, as well as targets in various sectors.
- Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets in 16 countries.
- The group uses preconfigured malware with target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses.
- Longhorn operates with a high degree of operational security and appears to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, with indicators suggesting it is from an English-speaking, North American country.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Longhorn gains initial access by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor malware, is it likely that their tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection as outlined in the Vault 7 documents before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected.
- The malware is designed for detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration.
- The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.
- The malware communicates externally at select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals to avoid detection.

**Vault 7 Documents:**
- The Vault 7 documents are a collection of CIA hacking tools and techniques that include methods to avoid detection and maintain operational security.

**Evaluation:**
- Longhorn's operational security measures and the design of their malware align with the principles of avoiding detection and maintaining operational security, which are also emphasized in the Vault 7 documents.
- The report mentions that Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected, which suggests that they are likely to follow guidelines to avoid detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. Longhorn uses operational security measures to remain undetected.
2. The malware is designed to avoid detection through various methods, such as custom cryptographic protocols and randomized communication intervals.
3. These measures align with the principles outlined in the Vault 7 documents.
4. Therefore, it is likely that Longhorn's tools will follow guidelines on tactics to avoid detection before performing detailed system fingerprinting for discovery.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
