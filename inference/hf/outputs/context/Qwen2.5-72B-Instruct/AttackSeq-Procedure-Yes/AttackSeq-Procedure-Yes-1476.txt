### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a watering hole attack to exploit CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** The malware downloads a DLL and runs it in PowerShell. It checks for antivirus software and exits if any are found. It also exploits CVE-2015-1701 for Local Privilege Escalation.
   - **Persistence:** The SLUB backdoor copies itself to `ProgramData\update\` and creates a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName, 'Microsoft Setup Initializazion', to call the export function `UpdateMPUnits` with `rundll32.exe`.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The downloader exploits CVE-2015-1701 to gain Local Privilege Escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The downloader exits if it detects any antivirus software processes.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. It also collects information from registry keys and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with the attackers via Slack, using hardcoded authentication tokens to post messages and command results to a private Slack channel.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel. They also create archive files of user's Desktop folders and build CAB files containing the file tree for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration by uploading files to the file.io website and sharing links via Slack.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report confirms that the SLUB backdoor achieves persistence by copying itself to `ProgramData\update\` and creating a Run registry key with a typo in the ValueName, 'Microsoft Setup Initializazion'.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the backdoor supports various commands for data collection, including taking screenshots, listing files, copying files, and uploading files to the file.io website. It also collects information from registry keys and creates archives of user's Desktop folders for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that the attackers exfiltrate data by uploading files to the file.io website and posting download links to the Slack channel.

   The report does not explicitly state that the backdoor retrieves the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics. However, given that the backdoor collects information from registry keys and supports various commands for data collection, it is reasonable to infer that it might retrieve the username and computer name as part of its broader data collection activities.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the reasonable inference from the backdoor's capabilities, the most plausible answer is that the SLUB backdoor is likely to retrieve the username and computer name as part of its discovery tactics before proceeding with data exfiltration.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
