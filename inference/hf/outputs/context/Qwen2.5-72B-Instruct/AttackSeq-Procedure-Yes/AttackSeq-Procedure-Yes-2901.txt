### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.
     - RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output, and installs persistently.
   - **Persistence:**
     - RoyalDNS installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
   - **Collection:**
     - APT15 used tools like CSVDE, BCP, and bespoke tools to extract information from various sources.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT15 deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS) and used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution after obtaining domain administrator credentials and stealing a VPN certificate.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Sequence of TTPs in the CTI Report:**
     1. **Credential Access:**
        - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials.
        - APT15 stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
     2. **Execution:**
        - APT15 deployed backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     3. **Defense Evasion:**
        - RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - **Sequence in the Question:**
     - APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate.
     - APT15 deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS).
     - APT15 used RoyalCLI to bypass command prompt policy settings for execution.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that APT15 used Mimikatz to obtain domain administrator credentials and stole a VPN certificate for remote network access.
   - After gaining these credentials, APT15 deployed the backdoors BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
   - The report also mentions that RoyalCLI is used to bypass command prompt policy settings by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - The sequence of events in the question aligns perfectly with the sequence described in the CTI report.
