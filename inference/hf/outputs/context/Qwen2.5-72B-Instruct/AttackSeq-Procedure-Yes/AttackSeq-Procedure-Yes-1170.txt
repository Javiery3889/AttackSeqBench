### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The group uses publicly available exploits to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems.
- They target specific external IP addresses owned by organizations.
- They use recently published exploits (e.g., CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2019-9670) to gain initial footholds.
- They also use spear-phishing to obtain authentication credentials to internet-accessible login pages.

**Persistence:**
- Upon gaining access, the group drops further tooling and seeks to obtain legitimate credentials to maintain persistent access.
- They use anonymizing services when using stolen credentials.

**Others:**
- APT29 is part of Russian intelligence services.
- They target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare, and energy targets.
- They have targeted organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.
- They use custom malware known as 'WellMess' and 'WellMail'.
- SoreFang is a first stage downloader that uses HTTP to exfiltrate victim information and download second stage malware.
- SoreFang targets SangFor devices.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After maintaining persistent access by likely dropping further tooling and using stolen credentials with anonymizing services, is APT29 likely to deploy WellMess or WellMail malware to establish command and control using encrypted channels?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Conduct widespread scanning and exploitation.
   - Use recently published exploits.
   - Use spear-phishing to obtain credentials.
2. **Persistence:**
   - Drop further tooling.
   - Obtain legitimate credentials.
   - Use anonymizing services.
3. **Command and Control:**
   - Deploy custom malware (WellMess or WellMail).

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that APT29 uses custom malware known as 'WellMess' and 'WellMail' to target organizations globally, including those involved with COVID-19 vaccine development.
- The report also mentions that these malware are used to target organizations, implying they are part of the group's toolkit for maintaining and extending their presence in the network.
- The use of custom malware like WellMess and WellMail is consistent with the group's strategy to maintain persistent access and establish command and control.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- APT29 gains initial access using exploits and spear-phishing.
- They maintain persistent access by dropping further tooling and using stolen credentials with anonymizing services.
- The report explicitly mentions that APT29 uses custom malware (WellMess and WellMail) to target organizations.
- Given the group's focus on maintaining persistent access and the use of custom malware, it is highly likely that they would deploy WellMess or WellMail to establish command and control using encrypted channels.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
