### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll' loader.
- Archive files with legitimate executable and malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
- Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.

**Execution:**
- Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.

**Persistence:**
- Established through 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
- Injected into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.

**Defense Evasion:**
- C&C servers operated within limited daily windows.
- Used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.

**Discovery:**
- Aria-body backdoor gathered detailed system and network information:
  - Host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, Windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, public IP.
  - Installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, services data.

**Collection:**
- Capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.

**Others:**
- Targeted national government entities in the Asia Pacific region.
- Used servers within infected ministries as C&C servers.
- Infrastructure primarily used GoDaddy for domain registration and Alibaba for hosting.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After gathering detailed system and network information through the Aria-body backdoor during the Discovery tactic, is the Naikon APT group likely to use HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed system and network information.
- The backdoor has capabilities to collect and send data.
- The group uses C&C servers to relay and route stolen data.
- The C&C servers are operational within limited daily windows.

**Evaluation:**
- **HTTP and TCP Protocols:**
  - HTTP is a common protocol for web traffic and can be used to send data and receive commands.
  - TCP is a reliable protocol for establishing connections and transferring data.
  - The report mentions that the Aria-body backdoor collects and sends data, and the C&C servers are used to relay and route stolen data.
  - The group's use of C&C servers and the detailed information gathered suggest that they need a reliable and common method to communicate and transfer data.

**Conclusion:**
- Given the detailed system and network information gathered and the need for reliable data transfer, it is highly likely that the Naikon APT group uses HTTP and TCP protocols for sending collected data and listening for additional commands during the Command and Control stage.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
