### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Tortoiseshell created a fake veteran hiring website (hiremilitaryheroes[.]com) to conduct reconnaissance.
     - The website prompted users to download an app, which was a malware downloader.
     - The downloaded reconnaissance tool, named 'bird.exe' with the internal name Liderc, collected extensive information from the victim's machine.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Tortoiseshell gained initial access by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website hiremilitaryheroes[.]com.
     - The app served as a malware downloader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RAT named 'IvizTech' was installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence on the victim's system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The malware checked if Google was reachable before proceeding with the installation.
     - The RAT was modular and required the installer for access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The reconnaissance tool 'bird.exe' performed discovery by collecting detailed information about the victim's machine.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The RAT communicated with a C2 server, with the IP address provided as an argument to the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries before the RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The initial access is gained by tricking users into downloading a fake app from the fraudulent website.
     - This app serves as a malware downloader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RAT named 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - The malware downloader is the first step after initial access.
     - The RAT 'IvizTech' is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware downloader is the initial payload that is executed after the user is tricked into downloading the fake app.
   - The malware downloader is responsible for downloading and executing additional binaries, including the RAT 'IvizTech'.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the malware downloader will execute binaries (including the RAT 'IvizTech') before the RAT is installed and executed as a service to maintain persistence.
