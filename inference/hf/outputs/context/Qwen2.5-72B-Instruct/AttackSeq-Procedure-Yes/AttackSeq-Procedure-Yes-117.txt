### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Agrius exploited public-facing applications, specifically FortiOS CVE-2018-13379 and other 1-day vulnerabilities.
     - Successful exploitation led to the uploading of webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
   - **Execution:**
     - Agrius deployed custom malware, including the .NET backdoor 'IPsec Helper'.
     - This backdoor was used to exfiltrate data or deploy additional malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Webshells with variations of ASPXSpy were used, some obfuscated with a custom base64 encoding function.
     - 'IPsec Helper' had functionality to update its engine and delete traces of itself.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Webshells were used to tunnel RDP traffic and leverage compromised accounts for lateral movement.
     - Publicly available offensive security tools were used for credential harvesting and lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - 'IPsec Helper' communicated with C2 servers over HTTP.
     - The malware awaited commands from these relays, including updating relays, sending recon information, downloading files, and self-deletion.
   - **Impact:**
     - Agrius deployed wipers, including 'Apostle' and DEADWOOD, to destroy data on targeted systems.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Agrius will deploy custom malware ('IPsec Helper' backdoor) for execution before achieving persistence by registering the 'IPsec Helper' as a service and deploying webshells on compromised systems.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Agrius gains initial access by exploiting public-facing applications and uploads webshells for lateral movement using RDP.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining initial access, Agrius deploys the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The 'IPsec Helper' backdoor is registered as a service for persistence.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Webshells are used for lateral movement, which is mentioned both in the initial access and lateral movement sections.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that after gaining initial access, Agrius deploys the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution.
   - The backdoor is then registered as a service for persistence.
   - The webshells are used for lateral movement, but the deployment of the 'IPsec Helper' backdoor for execution is a distinct step that occurs before achieving persistence.
