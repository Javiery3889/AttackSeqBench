### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack leveraged the CVE-2015-5119 exploit code.
- The exploit was hosted at `www[.]cbppnews[.]com/movie.swf`.
- Upon successful exploitation, a file was saved at `%Temp%/Rdws.exe` and executed.
- This file wrote another file at `%TEMP%/adobe.dat`, which served as a first stage downloader.
- The first stage downloader retrieved a second stage PlugX file.
- The PlugX file connected to several C2 domains, starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.

**Others:**
- The Sakula malware variant has been linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns.
- Sakula and PlugX have been observed using the same C2 infrastructure.
- Sakula is a limited-release tool used by multiple adversaries and is likely well-resourced.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting CVE-2015-5119 to execute a first stage downloader that retrieves the second stage PlugX file and successfully connects to several C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`, is it likely that the Sakula malware will communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` as part of its command and control protocol?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The first stage downloader retrieves a second stage PlugX file.
- The PlugX file connects to C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
- Sakula and PlugX have been observed using the same C2 infrastructure.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - This would imply that Sakula malware, after the initial stages, would communicate with additional C2 domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.
  - The report does not explicitly mention these domains, but it does state that Sakula and PlugX share the same C2 infrastructure.
  - However, the report does not provide any evidence or indication that these specific domains are part of the C2 infrastructure used by Sakula.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This would imply that Sakula malware does not communicate with domains such as `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com` as part of its command and control protocol.
  - The report focuses on the C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com` and does not mention any other specific domains.
  - Given the limited information provided, it is more reasonable to conclude that Sakula does not communicate with these specific domains unless explicitly stated otherwise.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the PlugX file connects to C2 domains starting with `cdn[.]sanecat[.]com`.
- The report mentions that Sakula and PlugX share the same C2 infrastructure, but it does not provide any evidence that Sakula communicates with `inocnation[.]com` or `oa[.]ameteksen[.]com`.
- Without additional information, it is more plausible to conclude that Sakula does not communicate with these specific domains.

**Final Answer: B: No**
