### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for long-term remote access.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to ensure malware remains active.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools like Robocopy and PSCP.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after conducting internal reconnaissance, APT10 is likely to identify systems of interest and use remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report clearly states that APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Data Staging and Compression:** The report mentions that APT10 exfiltrates data by 'pushing' it to other networks and 'pulling' it to C2 servers. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools for staging data in multi-part archives.
   - **Logical Sequence:** After mapping the network, it is logical for APT10 to identify systems of interest and prepare for data exfiltration. Using compression tools to stage data is a common technique to make exfiltration more efficient and less detectable.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of remote command execution scripts to launch compression tools, the logical sequence of actions and the known techniques of APT10 suggest that this is a plausible step in their exfiltration process.
   - APT10's sophisticated and methodical approach to data exfiltration, including the use of multi-stage exfiltration methods, supports the likelihood of using compression tools to stage data.
