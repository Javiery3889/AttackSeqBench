### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Date:** July 8, 2015
- **Method:** Spear-phishing attack
- **Vulnerability Exploited:** Adobe Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119)
- **Domains Involved:** rpt.perrydale[.]com, report.perrydale[.]com
- **IP Address:** 194.44.130.179
- **Exploit File:** show.swf
- **Secondary Payload:** b.gif

**Execution:**
- **Exploit File:** show.swf
- **ActionScript Classes:** MainClass.as, MyClass.as, MyClass1.as, MyClass2.as, MyUtils.as, ShellWin32.as
- **Function:** TryExpl in MyClass.as
- **Exploit Mechanism:** Use-after-free condition to exploit CVE-2015-5119
- **Shared Functions:** Data type manipulation, logging, and decrypting shellcode
- **Similarity to Previous Attack:** Shared techniques with CVE-2015-3113 attacks
- **Payload Extraction:** From an animated GIF image (b.gif)

**Others:**
- **Attribution:** Likely to APT group UPS or APT3
- **Techniques:** Payload extraction and decryption from GIF image
- **Shellcode Similarity:** 99% similar to CVE-2015-3113 shellcode

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- **Context:** After the spear-phishing attack leveraging a malicious Adobe Flash exploit to gain initial access by exploiting CVE-2015-5119
- **Query:** Is it likely that the Flash file ‘show.swf’ will attempt to execute shellcode for Defense Evasion before the shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing email with a link to a Flash exploit.
2. **Exploit Execution:** The Flash file (show.swf) exploits CVE-2015-5119.
3. **Shellcode Execution:** The exploit contains ActionScript to execute shellcode.
4. **Payload Installation:** The shellcode installs the payload embedded in the GIF image (b.gif).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report does not explicitly mention any steps for defense evasion before the payload installation.
- The focus is on the exploitation of the vulnerability and the execution of the shellcode to install the payload.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report mentions shared functions and techniques with previous attacks, but it does not indicate any specific defense evasion steps before payload installation.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines the sequence of events: initial access through spear-phishing, exploitation of the Flash vulnerability, execution of shellcode, and installation of the payload.
- There is no mention of any defense evasion techniques being employed before the shellcode installs the payload.
- The primary focus is on the exploitation and payload installation, suggesting that the shellcode directly proceeds to install the payload without additional defense evasion steps.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
