### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader exploits a side-loading vulnerability to execute the Korplug variant.
   - **Persistence:** Korplug creates hidden system directories and sets up persistence via scheduled tasks or registry entries.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Discovery:** Korplug collects system information such as uptime, Windows version, CPU clock rate, amount of RAM, display resolution, system locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Korplug is likely to collect data from removable media during the Collection phase after it retrieves system details during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report explicitly states that Korplug collects extensive system information, including system locale, hostname, and IP addresses.
   - **Collection Phase:** The report does not mention any specific activities related to collecting data from removable media. The focus is on system information and communication with C&C servers.
   - **Contextual Information:** The campaign's primary targets are research entities, internet service providers, and European diplomatic missions. The goal seems to be to gather sensitive information and maintain persistence rather than targeting removable media.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, focusing on the initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration phases.
   - The Discovery phase is well-documented, and the information collected is specific to the system and network.
   - There is no mention of activities related to removable media in the report.
   - Given the nature of the targets and the goals of the campaign, it is more likely that the threat actor is interested in system and network information rather than data from removable media.
