### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The FHAPPI campaign involved an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
- The malware was a VBScript encoded script hosted under the account 'vbiayay1'.
- When executed, the script downloaded a .doc file and opened it, leading to the execution of a PowerShell attack to infect the victim's system with Poison Ivy.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The campaign utilized multiple encodings and wraps to avoid detection, including multilayered base64 encoding.
- The attack was fileless, avoiding known signatures.
- The attack did not originate from the attacker's territory, improving the chances of a successful APT campaign.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware communicated with a C2 server located at the IP address 61.97.243.15, a dial-up IP in South Korea.
- The domain used for C2 communication was 'web.outlooksysm.net', registered to an individual in China.
- The WHOIS information for the domain included contact details for 'Liu Ying'.

**Others:**
- The FHAPPI campaign was first recognized in Japan and named 'Free Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy' (FHAPPI).
- The campaign utilized Geocities Japan for hosting malware and targeted victims with a modified PowerSploit PoC code.
- The main payload was Poison Ivy, injected into the 'userinit.exe' process.
- The campaign also targeted Mongolian users with documents in Mongolian.
- The malware actions included extracting victim information, calling back to a C2 server, and other nefarious activities.
- The campaign was linked to a larger APT campaign and utilized email addresses 'wisers.data@gmail.com' and 'health.pro.demo30@gmail.com' for phishing.
- The CNC IP address and the email sender addresses are recommended to be blocked and traced.
- The malware files associated with the campaign have been deleted with the help of Yahoo Incident Response Division (YIRD), JP-CERT/CC, and other security professionals in Japan.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the FHAPPI campaign delivered an APT phishing email containing a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website and the VBScript downloaded and opened a .doc file leading to its execution, is it likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - APT phishing email with a link to malware hosted on a Geocities website.
   - VBScript encoded script is downloaded and executed.
   - The script downloads a .doc file and opens it.
   - This leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - Multiple encodings and wraps, including multilayered base64 encoding.
   - Fileless attack to avoid known signatures.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report mentions that the VBScript encoded script leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
  - The report also states that the campaign utilized multiple encodings, including multilayered base64 encoding.
  - Given the fileless nature of the attack and the use of PowerShell, it is highly likely that the PowerShell command will run base64 encoded code and that the malware will use PowerShell for further execution.

- **B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the information provided in the report, which clearly indicates the use of PowerShell and base64 encoding.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the VBScript encoded script leads to the execution of a PowerShell attack.
- The report also mentions the use of multiple encodings, including multilayered base64 encoding, which is a common technique to evade detection.
- The fileless nature of the attack and the use of PowerShell align with the described sequence of events.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
