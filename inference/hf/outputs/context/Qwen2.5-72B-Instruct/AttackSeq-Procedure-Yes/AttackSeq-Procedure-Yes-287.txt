### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The threat actor uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
     - Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 (MS Word) and CVE-2014-6352 (PowerPoint).
     - Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a malicious PowerPoint document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials.
   - **Collection:**
     - The file-stealer module iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the backdoor is likely to ping the C2 server at regular intervals before collecting and uploading targeted file types (doc, docx, pdf) to the same server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Ping to C2 Server:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention that the backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals. However, it is a common practice for backdoors to maintain communication with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - **Collection and Upload:**
     - The report clearly states that the file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Sequence of Actions:**
     - The report indicates that the backdoor steals credentials and then collects and uploads files. It is reasonable to infer that the backdoor would maintain communication with the C2 server to receive instructions and confirm the success of the credential theft before proceeding to the collection and upload phase.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The backdoor's primary function is to maintain a persistent connection with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.
   - After stealing credentials, it is likely that the backdoor would ping the C2 server to confirm the success of the credential theft and receive further instructions.
   - The file-stealer module then collects and uploads files to the C2 server, which is a subsequent step in the attack sequence.
