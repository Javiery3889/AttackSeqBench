### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Volexity reported a strategic web compromise (SWC) of the South Korean online newspaper Daily NK's website.
- Malicious code was present from late March 2021 until early June 2021.
- The attackers, identified as North Korean APT InkySquid, modified legitimate files on the website to redirect users to attacker-owned domains hosting malicious JavaScript.
- This activity targeted Internet Explorer users, leveraging exploits such as CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411.

**Defense Evasion:**
- InkySquid attackers disguised exploit code within legitimate code on the compromised Daily NK website, making detection difficult.
- They restricted access to the exploit code to only exploitable user-agents, further evading automated scanning and detection.

**Others:**
- The BLUELIGHT malware, after successful exploitation, decrypts a final SVG variable containing a hex-encoded Cobalt Strike stager, which is then executed.
- The malware leverages Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations, collecting system information and screenshots, and supports various commands including file search, data harvesting, and implant uninstallation.
- IoCs and signatures related to this activity are available on Volexity's GitHub page.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After disguising exploit code within legitimate scripts on the compromised Daily NK website to evade detection, is it likely that the BLUELIGHT malware will utilize the Microsoft Graph API for command and control operations by performing oauth2 token authentication and setting up a directory structure in OneDrive?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers used sophisticated techniques to evade detection by disguising exploit code within legitimate scripts.
- The BLUELIGHT malware leverages the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations.
- The malware collects system information and screenshots and supports various commands.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - The report explicitly states that the BLUELIGHT malware leverages the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations.
  - The use of the Microsoft Graph API typically involves OAuth2 token authentication for API access.
  - Setting up a directory structure in OneDrive is a plausible action for a malware that uses the Microsoft Graph API, as it can be used to store and manage data.

- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the information provided in the report, which clearly indicates that the malware uses the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report confirms that the BLUELIGHT malware uses the Microsoft Graph API for C2 operations.
- The use of the Microsoft Graph API typically involves OAuth2 token authentication.
- Setting up a directory structure in OneDrive is a logical step for a malware that uses the Microsoft Graph API to manage and store data.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
