### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Employs passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, custom web shells, and other tools for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Uses proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on services using system service discovery before moving laterally in the network using WMI and custom web shells after obtaining credentials via LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms that FIN13 uses LSASS memory dumping and trojanized KeePass binaries to obtain credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - **Service Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention that FIN13 performs system service discovery before lateral movement. However, it is a common practice in cyber attacks to gather information about the environment before moving laterally to ensure the success of the operation.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that FIN13 is a sophisticated threat actor with a long-term presence in victim networks, it is highly likely that they would perform thorough reconnaissance and service discovery to understand the network environment before moving laterally.
   - The use of WMI and custom web shells for lateral movement suggests that FIN13 has a detailed understanding of the network, which is typically achieved through service discovery and other reconnaissance activities.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that FIN13 performs service discovery, it is a logical step in the attack chain for a group with their level of sophistication and operational goals.
