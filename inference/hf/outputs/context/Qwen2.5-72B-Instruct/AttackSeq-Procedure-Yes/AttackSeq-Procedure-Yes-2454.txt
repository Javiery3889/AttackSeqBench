### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing emails with HTML attachments redirecting to cloud storage sites to download a ZIP file containing a malicious executable.
   - **Execution:** The malicious executable is an HTA script that, when run, extracts and executes a VBS script from %temp% using mshta.exe. The VBS script fetches additional VBS code and downloads the final payload (banking Trojan).
   - **Persistence:** Registry keys are created in `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` using a string from a file named `car.dat`. A VBS script is set to persist and download the same ZIP archive.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Use of public cloud infrastructure and legitimate signed binaries to load malicious code.
   - **Collection:** Screenshots and mouse clicks are captured while browsing banking sites.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C2 server over raw TCP on port 9999, with the server selected based on a string in a file named `id`.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the banking Trojan will search for antivirus and banking software on the victim's system as part of its discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions the use of public cloud infrastructure and legitimate signed binaries to evade detection. This indicates that the attackers are taking steps to avoid being detected by security software.
   - **Persistence:** The report describes the creation of registry keys for persistence, which is a common technique to ensure the malware remains on the system.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention a discovery phase where the malware searches for antivirus and banking software. However, it is common for banking Trojans to include such a discovery phase to identify and target specific banking applications and to avoid detection by security software.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophisticated nature of the Metamorfo campaigns, including multi-stage infection chains and the use of evasion techniques, it is highly likely that the banking Trojan would include a discovery phase to identify and target specific banking applications and to avoid detection by security software.
   - The use of public cloud infrastructure and legitimate signed binaries for evasion suggests that the attackers are well-aware of the need to avoid detection, which would logically extend to searching for antivirus and banking software on the victim's system.
