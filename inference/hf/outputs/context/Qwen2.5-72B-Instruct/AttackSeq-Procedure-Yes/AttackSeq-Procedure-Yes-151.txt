### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Phosphorus group exploited the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (ProxyShell) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The PowerLess Backdoor executes PowerShell code within a .NET application context, avoiding the launch of 'powershell.exe'.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerLess Backdoor creates persistence through scheduled tasks, Registry RunKeys, or Startup Folder, and uses web shells.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor runs PowerShell within a .NET application, disables or modifies system firewalls, and modifies the registry.
   - **Credential Access:** The PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger module and performs OS credential dumping using LOLBIN techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoor performs account discovery.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers use the PowerLess Backdoor to run reconnaissance commands, create persistence, dump credentials, and move laterally.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor archives collected data, including browser data and keylogging information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor is likely to communicate with a command and control (C2) server using encrypted channels and proxy techniques after capturing user credentials and performing OS credential dumping.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report confirms that the PowerLess Backdoor captures user credentials using a keylogger and performs OS credential dumping using LOLBIN techniques.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of encrypted channels or proxy techniques for C2 communication. However, it is common for sophisticated malware to use such techniques to evade detection and maintain stealth.
   - **Contextual Information:** The Phosphorus group is known for using advanced techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence. They have been observed using open-source tools like Fast Reverse Proxy for RDP proxying, which suggests they are capable of using proxy techniques.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the sophistication of the Phosphorus group and the PowerLess Backdoor, it is highly likely that they would use encrypted channels and proxy techniques to communicate with the C2 server. This is a standard practice in advanced malware to avoid detection and ensure the longevity of the attack.
   - The use of Fast Reverse Proxy for RDP proxying, as mentioned in the report, further supports the likelihood of using proxy techniques.
