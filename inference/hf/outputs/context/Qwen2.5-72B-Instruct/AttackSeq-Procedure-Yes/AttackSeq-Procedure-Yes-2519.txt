### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The BlueDelta campaign targeted Ukrainian government entities and an organization involved in Ukrainian military aircraft infrastructure.
     - The campaign exploited vulnerabilities CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2020-12641, and CVE-2021-44026 in Roundcube webmail software.
     - Scripts were used to redirect incoming emails, perform reconnaissance, and exfiltrate session and user information.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The campaign gained initial access by exploiting the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730.
     - The campaign also exploited the Microsoft Outlook zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-23397 in 2022.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious scripts were executed through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software.
     - The scripts redirected future incoming emails and performed reconnaissance.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Obfuscation techniques were used to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Credentials were accessed by exploiting Roundcube webmail software vulnerabilities to dump OS credentials.
   - **Collection:**
     - Emails were collected by creating a filter within Roundcube's managesieve plugin.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Web protocols were used for command and control activities.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data was exfiltrated over alternative protocols and automated.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the BlueDelta campaign exploited the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730 for initial access before exploiting vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail software to conduct discovery activities focused on gathering information such as system and network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The CTI report clearly states that the BlueDelta campaign gained initial access by exploiting the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers using CVE-2020-35730.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report mentions that the campaign performed reconnaissance activities, which align with discovery activities focused on gathering information such as system and network configurations.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The sequence described in the question aligns with the sequence presented in the CTI report. The initial access was followed by discovery activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report confirms that the BlueDelta campaign used CVE-2020-35730 to gain initial access to the Ukrainian government's Roundcube mail servers.
   - After gaining initial access, the campaign performed reconnaissance activities, which are consistent with discovery activities.
   - The sequence of events in the question matches the sequence described in the CTI report.
