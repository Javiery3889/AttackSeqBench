### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Emissary Panda used tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Emissary Panda exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
   - **Execution:**
     - The threat actors uploaded tools, including Mimikatz, to the compromised servers.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Webshells (e.g., Antak, China Chopper variants) were installed for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Webshells were used to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and to maintain access.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Network reconnaissance was performed to identify vulnerable systems and gather information for lateral movement.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Stolen credentials and vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2017-0144) were used for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The HyperBro backdoor was used for C2 communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda performed the following sequence:
     1. Performed network reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems.
     2. Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells.
     3. Used Mimikatz to dump credentials for further network access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions that Emissary Panda used tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which aligns with the first step in the question.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that Emissary Panda exploited CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells, which aligns with the second step in the question.
   - **Execution:**
     - The report mentions that Mimikatz was uploaded to the compromised servers, which aligns with the third step in the question.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report indicates that stolen credentials were used for lateral movement, which is consistent with the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question is:
     1. **Reconnaissance:** Identify vulnerable systems.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploit CVE-2019-0604 to install webshells.
     3. **Execution:** Use Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - This sequence is supported by the CTI report:
     - **Reconnaissance:** Tools were used to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144.
     - **Initial Access:** CVE-2019-0604 was exploited to install webshells.
     - **Execution:** Mimikatz was uploaded to the compromised servers.
     - **Lateral Movement:** Stolen credentials were used for lateral movement.
