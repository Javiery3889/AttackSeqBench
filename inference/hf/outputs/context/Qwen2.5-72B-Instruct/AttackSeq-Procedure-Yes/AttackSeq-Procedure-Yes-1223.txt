### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deployed Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers. They also deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The attackers conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques to deliver malware.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 utilized DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed malicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload into memory.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessed Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deploying Trochilus and copying the NTDS.DIT database file containing password hashes for all users in the domain.
   - **Collection:** APT10 compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool.
   - **Command and Control:** The Trochilus malware C2 communications were encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream ciphers. The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com was used for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 and used WinRAR and cURL for Windows to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that APT10 will log in to the Visma network via Citrix servers using valid user accounts and exhibit logins consistent with Tianjin, China working hours for lateral movement after using Mimikatz to enable credential theft and accessing Visma's Microsoft Active Directory domain controller to deploy Trochilus and copy the NTDS.DIT database file.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that the attackers gained initial access through Citrix and LogMeIn using stolen valid user credentials.
   - **Credential Access:** The attackers used Mimikatz to steal credentials and accessed the Active Directory domain controller.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the timing or location of the logins, but it is common for APT groups to use stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - **Working Hours:** The report does not provide specific information about the working hours of the attackers. However, it is known that APT10 is associated with China, and it is plausible that they would operate during working hours in China.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Credential Theft:** The attackers gained initial access using stolen credentials and then used Mimikatz to steal more credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access to the Active Directory domain controller, it is logical for the attackers to use the stolen credentials for lateral movement.
   - **Working Hours:** While the report does not specify the working hours, APT10 is known to be associated with China, and it is reasonable to assume they would operate during working hours in China.
   - **Consistency with Tianjin, China Working Hours:** Given the association of APT10 with China, it is plausible that the logins would be consistent with working hours in Tianjin, China.
