### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- On February 11, 2016, two malicious emails were sent to officials at Indian embassies.
- The emails carried a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
- The RTF document dropped an embedded, encoded PE file named `svchost.exe` with downloader functionality.

**Command and Control:**
- The MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with C&C servers.
- Some modules lack C&C capability and rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

**Others:**
- The APT is dubbed 'Operation Transparent Tribe.'
- The malware is modular, with additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module.
- Infections occur in stages, starting with a downloader component.
- The RAT can perform various functions such as keylogging, browser credential theft, webcam spying, email theft, and screen recording.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will:
- Execute on the victim's machine.
- Attempt to download the full RAT component from `213.136.87[.]122:10001`.
- Establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The CTI report confirms that the initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158.
- The RTF document drops an embedded PE file named `svchost.exe` with downloader functionality.

**Execution and Download:**
- The report states that the infections occur in stages, starting with a downloader component.
- The downloader component is likely to attempt to download additional payloads, including the full RAT component.

**Command and Control:**
- The report confirms that the MSIL/Crimson malware uses a custom TCP protocol for communication with C&C servers.
- The specific IP address and port `213.136.87[.]122:10001` are not mentioned in the report, but the general behavior of the malware aligns with the described sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The initial access is achieved through a weaponized RTF document.
- The RTF document drops a downloader component (`svchost.exe`).
- The downloader component is likely to attempt to download the full RAT component.
- The malware uses a custom TCP protocol for command and control.

Given the information in the CTI report, it is highly likely that the MSIL/Crimson malware will execute on the victim's machine, attempt to download the full RAT component, and establish command and control using a custom TCP protocol.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
