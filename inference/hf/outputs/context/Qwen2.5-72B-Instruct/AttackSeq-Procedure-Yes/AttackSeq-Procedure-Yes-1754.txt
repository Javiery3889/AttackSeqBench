### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The attack began with the opening of a malicious document, likely delivered via phishing email.
- The document contained a custom backdoor known as Pterodo, which was executed using a suspicious command.

**Execution:**
- Shuckworm executed various VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence and executed commands via scripts.
- Additional variants of Pterodo were executed on July 16.
- A VNC client was installed as the ultimate payload on July 28.

**Persistence:**
- Shuckworm established persistence by creating scheduled tasks that executed malicious VBS files every few minutes.
- These tasks ensured that their backdoor would remain active even after system reboots.

**Collection:**
- Between July 29 and August 18, Shuckworm deployed multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor and executed VBS scripts.
- It is unclear if the documents accessed during this period were part of the attackers' efforts to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Command and Control:**
- Shuckworm established command and control by communicating with their servers using HTTP requests and downloading additional payloads.
- They used various C&C servers, including deep-pitched.enarto.ru, arianat.ru, and mucoris.ru, to control the compromised systems and download tools.

**Others:**
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has been tracking Shuckworm's activities.
- Shuckworm has been active since at least 2013 and has increased the sophistication of their attacks.
- They use living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally.
- Seven files used by Shuckworm were identified, including VBS files, a VNC client, and a Process Explorer binary.
- IOCs showed patterns such as C&C IPs belonging to a short list of hosting providers and suspected malicious files found in specific directories with names starting with the letter 'd'.
- The SSU reported over 5,000 attacks by Shuckworm since 2014, targeting more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After executing malicious VBS scripts to maintain their presence and deploying their custom backdoor, is Shuckworm likely to use mshta.exe to bypass application control solutions before employing their HTTP-based C&C servers for communication and tool downloading?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and execute their backdoor.
- They created scheduled tasks to ensure persistence.
- They used HTTP requests to communicate with C&C servers and download additional payloads.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions the use of VBS scripts and HTA files, which are often used to bypass application control solutions.
- mshta.exe is a common tool used to execute HTA files and can be used to bypass application control solutions.
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of mshta.exe, but it is a plausible tool given the context of using VBS scripts and HTA files.
- The sequence of using VBS scripts, HTA files, and then HTTP-based C&C communication aligns with the described attack sequence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- Shuckworm executed VBS scripts and HTA files to maintain their presence and deploy their backdoor.
- The use of VBS scripts and HTA files suggests a need to bypass application control solutions.
- mshta.exe is a common tool for executing HTA files and bypassing application control.
- The report mentions HTTP-based C&C communication and tool downloading, which follows the execution of VBS scripts and HTA files.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
