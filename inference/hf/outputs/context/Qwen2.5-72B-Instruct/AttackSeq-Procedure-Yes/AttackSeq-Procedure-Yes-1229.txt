### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
     - Initial reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
     - Second spear phish with a remote template to deliver a payload.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Exploit CVE-2017-11882 to gain initial access.
     - Use remote templates in Microsoft Word to load an external template.
   - **Execution:**
     - Deploy PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
     - POWERSHOWER fingerprints the machine, uploads information to C&C, and potentially runs a secondary payload.
   - **Persistence:**
     - POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1 and using a run key in the registry.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
     - Use POWERSHOWER as a first stage to make it harder for researchers to analyze more sophisticated payloads.
   - **Discovery:**
     - POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether POWERSHOWER is likely to communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop after collecting system information and sending it to the C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the CTI Report:**
     - POWERSHOWER is described as a PowerShell backdoor that uploads information to the C&C server.
     - It is used to fingerprint the machine and potentially run a secondary payload.
     - It sets up persistence and uses anti-forensics techniques.
   - **Logical Inference:**
     - Backdoors are typically designed to maintain a persistent connection with the C2 server to receive further commands and instructions.
     - The fact that POWERSHOWER uploads information to the C2 server suggests that it is capable of communication.
     - The persistence mechanism (writing to %AppData% and using a run key) indicates that the attackers intend to maintain long-term control over the infected machine.
     - The use of anti-forensics techniques and the potential to run a secondary payload further supports the idea that POWERSHOWER is designed to maintain a communication loop with the C2 server.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided in the CTI report and the logical inference, it is highly likely that POWERSHOWER will communicate with the C2 server and enter a communications loop as part of maintaining Command and Control.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
