### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will engage in protocol tunneling during the command and control (C2) phase after scanning for open ports and shared folders.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and fscan to scan for open ports and shared folders.
   - **Command and Control (C2) Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention protocol tunneling in the C2 phase. However, it does mention the use of C2 channels for data exfiltration and ensuring that stolen data is packaged to avoid detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions the use of proxy tools like lcx and frp to establish network tunnels between the target's network and external servers.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to C2 Transition:** After discovering open ports and shared folders, it is logical for the threat actor to establish a reliable and stealthy communication channel with the compromised systems.
   - **Use of Proxy Tools:** The report mentions the use of proxy tools like lcx and frp, which are often used for tunneling and maintaining C2 communication.
   - **Stealth and Evasion:** Given the emphasis on defense evasion and avoiding detection, protocol tunneling is a common technique to maintain C2 communication while evading network defenses.
