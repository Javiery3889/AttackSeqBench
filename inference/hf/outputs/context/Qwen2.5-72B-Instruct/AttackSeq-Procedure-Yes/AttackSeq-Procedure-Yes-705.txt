### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190):** TA505 exploited the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution (T1059.001):** TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005):** TA505 hijacked a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and altered the COM handler to execute the FlawedGrace RAT.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1112):** TA505 changed the CLSID of the COM handler to redirect to a different CLSID containing the FlawedGrace RAT loader encoded in Base64.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TA505 will store the FlawedGrace RAT loader as Base64 encoded strings for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly mentions that TA505 changed the CLSID of the COM handler to redirect to a different CLSID containing the FlawedGrace RAT loader encoded in Base64.
   - This indicates that TA505 is using Base64 encoding as a method to store and execute the FlawedGrace RAT loader, which is a form of defense evasion (T1112).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access (T1190):** TA505 exploited the SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability.
   - **Execution (T1059.001):** TA505 used Base64 encoded PowerShell commands to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon.
   - **Persistence (T1053.005):** TA505 hijacked a scheduled task and altered the COM handler.
   - **Defense Evasion (T1112):** The FlawedGrace RAT loader is stored in Base64 encoded form in the altered COM handler.

   Given that the report clearly states that the FlawedGrace RAT loader is encoded in Base64, it is highly likely that TA505 is using this method for defense evasion.
