### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX documents to gain initial access. These emails were spoofed to appear as if they were from other government-related entities. The attachments used the remote template technique to retrieve the next stage from the attacker's server.
   - **Execution:** The attackers leveraged old Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and a chain of in-memory loaders to install a previously unknown backdoor on victims' machines. The RTF files were weaponized using a variant of RoyalRoad, which exploits Equation Editor vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
   - **Persistence:** The attackers established persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'Windows Update' that ran the exported function 'StartW' from a DLL named '5.t' with 'rundll32.exe' once a day.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, anti-sandboxing techniques, and dynamic API resolving to hide their main functionality and avoid detection.
   - **Discovery:** The loader gathered detailed information about the victim's computer, including hostname, OS name and version, system type, user name, and MAC addresses of networking adapters. It also queried WMI for anti-virus information.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor collected a wide range of data from the victim's system, including file manipulation, process and service information, screenshots, command execution, network tables, registry keys, and system information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicated with a C&C server using encrypted communication. It sent a 'Start conversation' message and received a 'Get Victim Information' message in return.
   - **Exfiltration:** The backdoor exfiltrated data over the C&C channel, including screenshots, files, and system information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the backdoor will shut down the victim's computer to disrupt operations and impact system availability after exfiltrating data over the C&C channel using encrypted communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Objective of the Attack:** The CTI report indicates that the primary objective of the attack was surveillance and data collection. The attackers were interested in gathering detailed information about the victim's system and exfiltrating sensitive data.
   - **Behavior of the Backdoor:** The backdoor was designed to maintain persistence and communicate with the C&C server to exfiltrate data. There is no mention of the backdoor being designed to shut down the victim's computer or disrupt operations.
   - **Impact on Operations:** Shutting down the victim's computer would likely disrupt the attackers' ability to continue their surveillance and data collection activities. This would be counterproductive to their goals.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers' primary goal is to maintain a persistent presence on the victim's system and exfiltrate data.
   - Shutting down the victim's computer would disrupt the attackers' ability to achieve their surveillance objectives.
   - The report does not mention any tactics or techniques that suggest the attackers intended to cause system availability issues.
   - The use of anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques, as well as the establishment of persistence, indicates that the attackers want to remain undetected and continue their operations.
