### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Phishing email targeting Tibetan organizations.
- Impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association'.
- Originating from a known TA413 Gmail account.
- Contained a malicious URL (hxxps://you-tube[.]tv) leading to a fake 'Adobe Flash Player Update' themed landing page.
- Executed JavaScript files to profile the user's system and determine the delivery of the 'FriarFox' malicious Firefox browser extension.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The FriarFox browser extension, once installed, allows threat actors to gain access to the user's Gmail account and Firefox browser data.
- Contacts a command and control server to retrieve the PHP and JS-based payload Scanbox.
- The extension is designed to search, archive, read, label, mark as spam, delete, refresh, forward emails, and perform function searches in Gmail.
- Access user data for all websites, display notifications, and modify privacy settings in Firefox.

**Others:**
- The FriarFox browser extension is based on the open-source tool 'Gmail Notifier (restartless)' and has been altered by TA413 to include malicious functionality and conceal its presence.
- TA413 has used the Scanbox framework since at least June 2020.
- Linked to watering hole attacks targeting Tibetan organizations in 2019.
- The campaign leverages the legitimate domain Tibet[.]net as a decoy and delivers Scanbox via the malicious browser extension.
- TA413's campaigns have also used COVID-19 and self-immolation themed lures to deliver Sepulcher malware via malicious RTF files.
- Despite public disclosures, TA413 has not made significant operational changes and is expected to continue targeting the Tibetan Diaspora.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After executing phishing emails impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association' to deliver the FriarFox malicious browser extension for initial access, is it likely that the threat actors will use this extension to contact a command and control server and then retrieve the Scanbox payload?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Phishing email impersonating the 'Tibetan Women's Association'.
   - Delivery of the FriarFox malicious browser extension.

2. **Defense Evasion:**
   - FriarFox browser extension contacts a command and control server.
   - Retrieves the Scanbox payload.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report clearly states that the FriarFox browser extension, once installed, contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
  - This aligns with the sequence described in the question.

- **B: No**
  - This answer would be incorrect because the report explicitly mentions that the FriarFox extension contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides a clear sequence of events where the FriarFox browser extension, after being delivered via a phishing email, contacts a command and control server to retrieve the Scanbox payload.
- This sequence matches the scenario described in the question.

**Final Answer:**
- Final Answer: A: Yes
