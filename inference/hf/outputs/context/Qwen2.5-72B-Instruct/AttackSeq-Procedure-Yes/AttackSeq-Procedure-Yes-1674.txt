### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The attackers used the SocGholish framework, found on over 150 compromised websites, to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.

**Initial Access:**
- The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
- Victims received a zipped file containing malicious JavaScript disguised as a browser update.
- This led to the execution of a second JavaScript file by wscript.exe, profiling the computer and downloading additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.

**Execution:**
- The attackers deployed Cobalt Strike using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector taken from an open-source project called Donut.
- This was used to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload, capable of command execution, process injection, privilege escalation, and file upload/download.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Privilege escalation was achieved using a publicly documented technique involving the Software Licensing User Interface tool (slui.exe).
- The attackers also used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- To deploy the ransomware, the attackers used PsExec to launch a command line tool for managing Windows Defender, disabling scanning, removing definitions, and in some cases, disabling real-time monitoring.
- They also used PsExec to stop services across the organization before launching the WastedLocker ransomware.

**Credential Access:**
- Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files, aiding in the concealment of the attackers' activities.

**Lateral Movement:**
- The attackers used Cobalt Strike Beacon for lateral movement, executing commands and injecting processes on remote computers.

**Command and Control:**
- The injected Cobalt Strike Beacon payload communicated with a command and control (C&C) domain, which was publicly reported as part of the WastedLocker attack infrastructure.

**Impact:**
- The end goal of the WastedLocker attacks was to cripple the victim's IT infrastructure by encrypting computers and servers, leading to significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that the attackers will use the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites for initial compromise before using the Get-NetComputer command from PowerView for remote system discovery?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework delivered via compromised legitimate websites. This aligns with the first part of the question.

**Remote System Discovery:**
- The report mentions that after the initial compromise, the attackers used PowerShell to download and execute additional discovery-related scripts. However, it does not specifically mention the use of the `Get-NetComputer` command from PowerView.
- PowerView is a PowerShell module that includes various commands for network discovery, including `Get-NetComputer`. While the report does not explicitly mention PowerView, it is reasonable to infer that the discovery-related PowerShell scripts could include similar functionality.

**Sequence of TTPs:**
- The sequence described in the question (SocGholish for initial access followed by remote system discovery) is consistent with the attack sequence described in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms the use of SocGholish for initial access.
- The report mentions the use of PowerShell for discovery-related activities, which could include commands similar to `Get-NetComputer` from PowerView.
- The sequence of TTPs in the question aligns with the attack sequence described in the report.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
