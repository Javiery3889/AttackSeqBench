### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to download and install the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service. Used DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicated with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FamousSparrow is likely to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor after establishing Command and Control.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that SparrowDoor communicates with the C&C server using HTTPS and encrypted communications with multi-byte XOR keys.
   - **Collection:** The report also mentions that SparrowDoor is capable of reading file contents and exfiltrating them to the C&C server.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Command and Control Capabilities:** SparrowDoor is designed to communicate with the C&C server using secure and encrypted methods.
   - **Data Exfiltration Capabilities:** The report explicitly states that SparrowDoor can read file contents and exfiltrate them to the C&C server.
   - **Logical Sequence:** Given that SparrowDoor is used for both Command and Control and data exfiltration, it is highly likely that FamousSparrow would use SparrowDoor to exfiltrate data over the C&C channel.
