### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** FamousSparrow exploited known remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera. They also acquired infrastructure from various hosting providers.
   - **Initial Access:** Gained access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications.
   - **Execution:** Used cmd.exe to run commands for downloading and installing the SparrowDoor backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** Created a registry Run key entry for SparrowDoor and installed it as a service named WSearchIndex. Used DLL search order hijacking to load K7UI.dll.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** No specific details provided.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Injected encrypted shellcode MpSvc.dll into processes, adjusted token privileges, and obfuscated files or information.
   - **Credential Access:** Used a custom version of Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Collected system information and probed files.
   - **Collection:** Read file contents and exfiltrated them to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrated data over the C&C channel using SparrowDoor.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that SparrowDoor will communicate with the C&C server via an encrypted HTTPS channel for Command and Control after the initial access and execution phases.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** The report confirms that FamousSparrow gained initial access by exploiting remote code execution vulnerabilities and used cmd.exe to execute SparrowDoor.
   - **Command and Control (C&C):** The report mentions that SparrowDoor is used for exfiltrating data over the C&C channel. While it does not explicitly state the communication protocol, it is common for advanced malware to use encrypted channels to avoid detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report indicates that FamousSparrow employed various defense evasion techniques, including injecting encrypted shellcode and obfuscating files. This suggests a sophisticated approach to maintaining stealth, which would likely extend to the C&C communication.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** Confirmed in the report.
   - **C&C Communication:** While not explicitly stated, the use of encrypted communication is a common and logical step for advanced malware to avoid detection and maintain control over the compromised system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report highlights the group's use of encryption and obfuscation, which aligns with the likelihood of using an encrypted HTTPS channel for C&C communication.
