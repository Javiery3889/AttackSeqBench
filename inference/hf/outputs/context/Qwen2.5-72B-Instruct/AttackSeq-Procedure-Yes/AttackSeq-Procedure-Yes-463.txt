### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Hidden Cobra targets cryptocurrency and financial organizations.
     - Similar domain names are used to mimic legitimate entities.
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Malicious domain falcancoin.io was created and updated.
     - Bankshot is a remote access tool with destructive capabilities.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document.
     - The document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Bankshot is designed to persist on the victim's network.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The implant is designed to evade detection and can wipe files.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files.
     - Communication with control servers, including Chinese-language online gambling sites.
     - URLs are hardcoded in the implants' code.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Bankshot implant will communicate with control servers disguised as ZIP files after being executed via the embedded Adobe Flash exploit in the malicious Word document Agreement.docx.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report confirms that the initial access is gained through spear phishing emails containing a malicious Word document with an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report states that the implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers.
   - **Execution:**
     - The exploit in the Word document (Agreement.docx) is used to execute the implant, which aligns with the report's description of the initial access method.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is achieved through a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document containing an embedded Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2018-4878).
   - Once the exploit is executed, the Bankshot implant is deployed.
   - The Bankshot implant is designed to communicate with control servers, and these implants are disguised as ZIP files.
   - The report explicitly states that the implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with control servers.
