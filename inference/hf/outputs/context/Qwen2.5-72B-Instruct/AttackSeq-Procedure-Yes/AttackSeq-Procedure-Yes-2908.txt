### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
     - They stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
   - **Execution:**
     - APT15 deployed three backdoors: BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS.
     - RoyalCLI bypasses policy settings that disable command prompt by copying and patching cmd.exe.
     - RoyalDNS uses DNS to take commands, execute them, and return output.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The RoyalDNS backdoor installs itself persistently on the victim's network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - RoyalCLI backdoor evades policy settings that disable command prompt execution by copying and patching cmd.exe.
   - **Collection:**
     - APT15 used tools like CSVDE, BCP, and bespoke tools to extract information from various sources.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether APT15 is likely to use the stolen VPN certificate to remotely access the network before deploying backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCLI, and RoyalDNS for execution.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT15 gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz.
     - They stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
   - **Execution:**
     - After gaining access, APT15 deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS).

   The sequence of events in the CTI report suggests that APT15 first gained domain administrator credentials using Mimikatz, then stole a VPN certificate to maintain remote access. After securing this access, they deployed the backdoors for execution.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Step 1:** APT15 used Mimikatz to gain domain administrator credentials.
   - **Step 2:** They stole a VPN certificate to access the network remotely.
   - **Step 3:** They deployed backdoors (BS2005, RoyalCLI, RoyalDNS) for execution.

   The sequence in the CTI report aligns with the question's proposed sequence: gaining domain administrator credentials, using the stolen VPN certificate for remote access, and then deploying backdoors.
