### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The Tuyul botnet, written in Perl, is used to execute commands on victim systems.
- Functionalities include:
  - Promoting bots to higher privilege (pro)
  - Demoting bots (noob)
  - Updating malware
  - Connecting to reverse shells (bc)
  - Executing shell commands (shell)
  - Running Perl scripts (perl)
  - Terminating the bot's connection (terminate, suicide)

**Persistence:**
- The Tuyul malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure its continued presence on the system.
- It also includes functionality to detect and terminate processes from other malware infections.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Tuyul malware uses a binary version that goes undetected by antivirus engines.
- It uses various PHP web shells to gain access to servers, including Tiny File Manager and an unknown advanced web shell.

**Command and Control:**
- The Tuyul botnet uses the domain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz as its C&C server.
- The C&C server and development servers are protected by Cloudflare.

**Others:**
- The Tuyul botnet has possible Indonesian attribution.
- The botnet's peak size was 366 victim systems.
- Infected servers are primarily hosted on cloud services such as AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode.
- The botnet's name, Tuyul, refers to a figure in Southeast Asian folklore.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems, is it likely that the Tuyul malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems before periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access on unpatched PHPUnit systems.
2. **Execution:** Executing Perl scripts and shell commands on victim systems.
3. **Persistence:** Periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron' to maintain persistence.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the Tuyul botnet has the capability to execute Perl scripts and shell commands.
- The report also mentions that the malware periodically downloads a bash script named 'cron' to ensure persistence.
- The sequence of actions described in the question aligns with the functionalities and tactics described in the CTI report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. **Initial Access:** The question mentions exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to gain initial access, which is a plausible method for initial compromise.
2. **Execution:** The Tuyul botnet is designed to execute Perl scripts and shell commands, as stated in the report.
3. **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by periodically downloading a bash script named 'cron', which is also mentioned in the report.

Given that the sequence of actions in the question matches the capabilities and tactics described in the CTI report, it is likely that the Tuyul malware will execute Perl scripts and shell commands before maintaining persistence by downloading the 'cron' script.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
