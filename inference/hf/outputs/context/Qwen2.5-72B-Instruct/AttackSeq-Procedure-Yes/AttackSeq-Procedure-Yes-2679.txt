### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - KiraV2 exploits vulnerabilities in IoT devices, specifically targeting MVPower DVR with JAWS Web Server and Huawei routers.
     - It uses remote code execution vulnerabilities and telnet brute-force attacks to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:**
     - KiraV2 executes DDoS attacks and distributes itself to vulnerable IoT devices.
     - It uses encoded strings for C&C server communication and employs anti-analysis techniques.
     - The malware ensures standalone execution by binding to a local port and confirming normal execution.
   - **Persistence:**
     - KiraV2 prevents system reboots by deactivating watchdog features and periodically resetting the watchdog timer.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - KiraV2 uses anti-analysis techniques such as encoding strings and changing process names.
     - It employs a signal handler registration method to hide the real C&C server address.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - KiraV2 conducts telnet dictionary attacks using a list of common credentials.
   - **Impact:**
     - KiraV2's primary impact is through DDoS attacks, including UDP flooding and TCP ACK flooding.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether KiraV2, after employing anti-analysis techniques, is likely to communicate with a C&C server and periodically receive commands for executing DDoS attacks.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Anti-Analysis Techniques:**
     - The report explicitly states that KiraV2 uses anti-analysis techniques such as encoding strings and changing process names.
   - **C&C Server Communication:**
     - The report mentions that KiraV2 uses encoded strings for C&C server communication.
   - **Periodic Commands for DDoS Attacks:**
     - The report indicates that KiraV2 executes various DDoS attacks, which implies that it likely receives commands from a C&C server to initiate these attacks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Anti-Analysis Techniques:**
     - KiraV2 employs anti-analysis techniques to evade detection, which is a common tactic for maintaining a low profile and ensuring the malware remains undetected.
   - **C&C Server Communication:**
     - The use of encoded strings for C&C server communication is a clear indication that KiraV2 maintains a communication channel with a C&C server.
   - **Periodic Commands:**
     - The execution of DDoS attacks, which are a primary impact of KiraV2, suggests that the malware receives commands from a C&C server to initiate these attacks. Periodic communication is necessary to coordinate and execute DDoS attacks effectively.
