### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:**
     - Acquired domains (wordkeyvpload[.]net, wordkeyvpload[.]org).
     - Developed capabilities including Graphite malware and Empire tools.
     - Purchased domains to serve as command and control servers.
     - Built malicious components and employed red teaming tools.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment (BM-D(2021)0247.xlsx).
     - Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2021-40444) to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects (CLSID: D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB6A-DCD83CCBA16D).
     - Created a local account (net user /add user1) to maintain access to victim systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Used reflective code loading (Empire DLL Launcher stager) to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Created multiple stages to obfuscate the command-and-control channel (use of different Empire stagers).
     - Used an existing, legitimate external web service (Microsoft OneDrive, Empire Server) for bidirectional communication.
     - Employed symmetric (AES 256) and asymmetric encryption to conceal command and control traffic.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attackers exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability for client execution before establishing persistence through hijacked Component Object Model (COM) references.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that the attackers sent spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment and exploited the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability to execute code on the victim's machine.
   - **Persistence:**
     - After gaining initial access, the attackers established persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects and creating a local account.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of events in the CTI report is clear:
     1. **Resource Development:** Acquire domains and develop malware.
     2. **Initial Access:** Exploit CVE-2021-40444 via spear phishing emails.
     3. **Persistence:** Establish persistence through COM hijacking and local account creation.
   - The question asks if the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 (client execution) occurred before establishing persistence through COM references.
   - According to the report, the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444 is part of the initial access phase, which logically precedes the persistence phase.
