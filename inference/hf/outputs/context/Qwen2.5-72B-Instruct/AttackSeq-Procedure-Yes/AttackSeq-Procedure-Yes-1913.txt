### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise targets.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT for long-term remote access and performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 achieves persistence through scheduled tasks or Windows services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking.
   - **Credential Access:** APT10 deploys tools like mimikatz or PwDump to steal credentials.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration in multi-part archives.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools like Robocopy and PSCP for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 'pushes' data to other networks and 'pulls' it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to leverage shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims and exploit systems that share access and credentials after conducting internal reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that APT10 performs internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
     - APT10 uses stolen MSP credentials and deploys credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions.
     - APT10 leverages MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - **Leveraging Shared Infrastructure:**
     - The report mentions that APT10 targets managed IT service providers (MSPs) and uses their infrastructure to move laterally and exfiltrate data.
     - APT10's methodology includes leveraging MSP infrastructure for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance to map out the network.
   - APT10 steals credentials, often using MSP credentials.
   - APT10 uses these credentials to gain higher-level permissions.
   - APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally between MSPs and other victims.
   - APT10 exploits systems that share access and credentials.
