### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The adversary obtained SSH access to the target system.
- Used `wget` to fetch malware samples from the IP address 175.45.250.xxx.
- The malware binary had a date string in its naming convention, suggesting it was compiled on the day it was downloaded.

**Persistence:**
- The Turbo Linux Kernel Module (LKM) provides persistence by hiding processes.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Derusbi malware and Turbo kernel module employ cloaking and anti-analysis techniques.
- The Turbo LKM is loaded into kernel space to modify the system's global call table, particularly pertaining to process IDs (PIDs).
- The LKM disables the CPU's control register zero's (CR0) write protection to modify the system call table.

**Discovery:**
- The Derusbi malware gathers information about the victim host, including the local host name, GCC version, and system information.
- This information is transferred back to the command and control infrastructure via network beacons.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware binds to a raw socket on a random source port between 31800 and 31900 and beacons to the preconfigured destination port 443.
- The traffic is not SSL/TLS encrypted.
- A backup communication method with HTTP beacon is used, with content obfuscated using variable 4-byte XOR keys.
- C2 interactions include HTTP POST requests to /photos/photo.asp and responses from the server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After obtaining SSH access to the target system and using `wget` to fetch the malware samples, is it likely that the Turbo Linux Kernel Module will be dropped to disk, loaded into the kernel, and subsequently deleted by the Derusbi malware to avoid detection?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Turbo LKM is used for persistence and defense evasion.
- The LKM is loaded into kernel space to modify the system's global call table and hide processes.
- The LKM disables the CPU's control register zero's (CR0) write protection to modify the system call table.

**Reasoning:**
- The Turbo LKM is a critical component for maintaining persistence and evading detection.
- For the LKM to be effective, it must be loaded into the kernel.
- Dropping the LKM to disk and then loading it into the kernel is a common technique to ensure it is available for loading.
- After loading, deleting the LKM from disk can help avoid detection by file-based scanning tools.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes** - This aligns with the need for the LKM to be loaded into the kernel and the common practice of deleting it from disk to avoid detection.
- **B: No** - This would imply that the LKM is not deleted after loading, which would increase the risk of detection.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
