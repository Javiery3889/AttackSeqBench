### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The NEWSCASTER operation involved creating fake personas and a fictitious news organization to support their espionage activities. They used these personas to establish connections on social media platforms and harvest credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** The Iranian hackers used social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, and Blogger to initiate their attack. They sent spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to capture credentials, gaining initial access to their targets' networks.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used low-tech approaches to avoid traditional security defenses, exploiting social media and the human element.
   - **Credential Access:** The campaign focused on credential harvesting and reconnaissance. The attackers used social media connections to harvest corporate and personal email credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** After establishing connections on social media, the attackers used the harvested credentials to potentially move laterally within the networks of their targets.
   - **Command and Control:** The campaign leveraged malware with the capability to exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Iranian threat actors will connect with US officials on social media to gather victim identity information during the Reconnaissance phase before using spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages for Initial Access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** The report clearly states that the attackers created fake personas and a fictitious news organization to support their espionage activities.
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report does not explicitly mention a separate Reconnaissance phase, but it implies that the attackers used social media connections to gather information and establish trust with their targets.
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that the attackers used social media platforms to send spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to capture credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report. The attackers first created fake personas (Resource Development), then used these personas to connect with US officials on social media to gather victim identity information (Reconnaissance), and finally sent spear-phishing messages with links to fake pages to capture credentials (Initial Access).
   - The report supports the idea that the attackers used social media to establish connections and gather information before initiating the attack.
