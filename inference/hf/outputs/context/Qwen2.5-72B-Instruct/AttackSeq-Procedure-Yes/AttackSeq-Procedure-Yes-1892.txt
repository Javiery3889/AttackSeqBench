### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for local command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE are used.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email communications.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities.
   - **Credential Access:** Process memory dumping of LSASS, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, BUSTEDPIPE, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will collect targeted data from network shared drives and stage it locally or remotely before archiving the collected data after using WMI for remote command execution and lateral movement with tools like BUSTEDPIPE and Invoke-SMBExec.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report confirms that FIN13 uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, BUSTEDPIPE, and Invoke-SMBExec for lateral movement.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using tools like web shells and JSP tools. This implies that they collect and stage data before exfiltration.
   - **Data Collection and Staging:** The report does not explicitly mention the staging of data, but the use of web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories suggests that data is collected and staged before exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - FIN13 uses WMI and other tools for lateral movement, which aligns with the question.
   - The exfiltration process involves using web shells and JSP tools, indicating that data is collected and staged before being exfiltrated.
   - The long dwell time and focus on financial data suggest that FIN13 is methodical and likely stages data to ensure successful exfiltration.
