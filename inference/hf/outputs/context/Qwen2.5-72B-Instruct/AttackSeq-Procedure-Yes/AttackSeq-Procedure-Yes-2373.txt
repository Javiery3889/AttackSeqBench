### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Turla used stolen credentials (T1078) to deploy LightNeuron on Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - **Execution:** A PowerShell script (T1086) was used to install LightNeuron.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stolen credentials (T1078) were used to obtain administrative rights.
   - **Collection:** LightNeuron collects emails (T1114) and local files (T1005) and can automatically collect files from specific paths (T1119).
   - **Command and Control:** LightNeuron uses emails for C&C communication, encrypted with AES (T1032, T1071, T1001).
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated through the email C&C channel (T1041) and can be scheduled (T1029), with data encrypted using AES (T1022).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if LightNeuron is likely to execute the functions `GetAdaptersInfo` and `GetComputerName` for system network configuration discovery before collecting emails and exfiltrating them through an email C&C channel encrypted using AES.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **System Network Configuration Discovery:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of `GetAdaptersInfo` or `GetComputerName` for system network configuration discovery. These functions are typically associated with the Discovery tactic (T1016, System Network Configuration Discovery).
   - **Collection and Exfiltration:** The report clearly states that LightNeuron collects emails (T1114) and exfiltrates data through the email C&C channel (T1041) using AES encryption (T1022).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not provide any evidence that LightNeuron performs system network configuration discovery using `GetAdaptersInfo` or `GetComputerName` before collecting and exfiltrating data.
   - The primary focus of LightNeuron, as described in the report, is on collecting emails and exfiltrating data through the email C&C channel.
   - While system network configuration discovery could be a useful step in a broader attack, the report does not indicate that it is a part of the specific sequence of actions described.
