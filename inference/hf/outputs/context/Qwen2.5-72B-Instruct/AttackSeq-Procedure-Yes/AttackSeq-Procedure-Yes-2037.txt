### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with an infected Excel document exploiting CVE-2014-4114 in Microsoft Office 2013.
   - **Execution:** The malware is executed through a Visual Basic macro, which reassembles and runs a PE32 executable (vba_macro.exe). This executable drops FONTCACHE.DAT and rundll32.exe, with FONTCACHE.DAT acting as a network sniffer.
   - **Persistence:** The malware registers a binary to the startup shell to ensure FONTCACHE.DAT runs at startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware uses various anti-debugging techniques.
   - **Discovery:** The malware gathers network information using the GetAdaptersInfo() function.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The malware is designed to move laterally and send data to servers in major ISPs across Europe.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP, sending localization data and keyboard layout information.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after communicating with the C2 server and sending localization data and keyboard layout information, the malware is likely to function as a network sniffer and send gathered information to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Network Sniffer Functionality:** The CTI report explicitly states that FONTCACHE.DAT operates as a network sniffer.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the malware sends data to servers in major ISPs across Europe, which aligns with the idea of exfiltrating gathered information.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report confirms that the malware communicates with the C2 server using HTTP and sends localization data and keyboard layout information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The malware's network sniffer functionality (FONTCACHE.DAT) is a key part of its capabilities.
   - The malware is designed to exfiltrate data, as evidenced by its communication with the C2 server and the data it sends.
   - Given that the malware has already established communication with the C2 server and is capable of exfiltrating data, it is logical to conclude that it would continue to exfiltrate data gathered by the network sniffer.
