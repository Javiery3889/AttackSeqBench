### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Turla used stolen credentials (T1078) to deploy LightNeuron on Microsoft Exchange servers.
   - **Execution:** A PowerShell script (T1086) was used to install LightNeuron.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Stolen credentials (T1078) were used to obtain administrative rights.
   - **Discovery:** LightNeuron uses functions like GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName to discover system network configurations (T1016).
   - **Command and Control:** LightNeuron uses emails for C&C communication, encrypted with AES (T1032, T1071), and data is hidden in PDF or JPG files using steganography (T1001).
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated through the email C&C channel (T1041) and can be scheduled (T1029). The data is encrypted using AES (T1022).

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if LightNeuron is likely to collect emails and local files automatically for eventual exfiltration via its backdoor functions after discovering system network configurations.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (T1016):** LightNeuron discovers system network configurations using functions like GetAdaptersInfo and GetComputerName.
   - **Exfiltration (T1041, T1029, T1022):** Data exfiltration is conducted through the email C&C channel and can be scheduled. The data is encrypted using AES.
   - **Collection of Emails and Local Files:** The report does not explicitly state that LightNeuron collects emails and local files automatically. However, given that the backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data and can use the email C&C channel, it is reasonable to infer that it might collect emails and local files as part of its exfiltration process.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** LightNeuron discovers system network configurations, which is a necessary step to understand the environment and identify potential targets for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration Mechanism:** The backdoor uses the email C&C channel for exfiltration, which suggests that it has the capability to send data out of the network.
   - **Data Collection:** While the report does not explicitly state that LightNeuron collects emails and local files, the combination of its discovery capabilities and exfiltration mechanisms strongly suggests that it is designed to gather and send out data, including emails and local files.
