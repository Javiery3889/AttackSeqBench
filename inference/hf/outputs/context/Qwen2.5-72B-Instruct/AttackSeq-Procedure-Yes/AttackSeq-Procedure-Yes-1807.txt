### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with RTF documents exploiting Microsoft Word vulnerabilities, specifically the Equation Editor vulnerabilities, to deliver a new malware implant.
   - **Execution:** The 'intel.wll' file is dropped into the Word startup folder and executed upon relaunching Word. This file downloads and decrypts a DLL file from a C&C server, which acts as the main loader for the malware framework. The main loader then communicates with another C&C server to receive additional functionality and downloads a RAT module.
   - **Persistence:** The 'intel.wll' file is used to maintain persistence by being executed every time Microsoft Word is launched.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The C&C server has directory listing enabled for a limited time, and files are encrypted but can be decrypted using the same scheme observed in the infection chain.
   - **Command and Control:** The main loader and RAT module communicate with C&C servers to receive commands and send collected data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the RAT module downloaded during the final stage of the infection chain is likely to have capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **RAT Capabilities:** RATs (Remote Access Trojans) are typically designed to provide a wide range of functionalities to the attacker, including but not limited to:
     - Taking screenshots
     - Listing files and directories
     - Executing new processes
   - **Context from the Report:** The report mentions that the RAT module is a DLL file loaded into memory and communicates with the C&C server to receive commands and send collected data. This suggests that the RAT module is designed to be versatile and capable of performing various tasks as directed by the C&C server.
   - **Common RAT Features:** Given the modular architecture of the malware and the nature of RATs, it is highly likely that the RAT module would include capabilities such as taking screenshots, listing files and directories, and executing new processes.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the RAT module is likely to have the capabilities to take screenshots, list files and directories, and execute new processes as part of its functionality.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
