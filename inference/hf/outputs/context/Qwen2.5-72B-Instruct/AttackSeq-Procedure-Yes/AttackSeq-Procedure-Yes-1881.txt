### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. BLUEAGAVE for local HTTP server and command execution.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT for email-based C2.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, web shells, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass.
   - **Discovery:** Native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Collection:** Data from network shared drives, archived using utilities and libraries.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and custom web shells such as BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement via remote services after internal reconnaissance, before collecting data from network shared drives and targeting specific information for fraudulent transactions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report confirms that FIN13 uses native OS binaries and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement. However, it does mention the use of web shells and custom malware for various purposes, including command execution and data exfiltration.
   - **Collection:** The report states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely, targeting specific data for fraudulent transactions.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery to Collection:** The sequence from discovery to collection is consistent with the report. FIN13 uses internal reconnaissance to gather information and then collects data from network shared drives.
   - **Lateral Movement:** While the report does not explicitly mention Invoke-WMIExec or BUSTEDPIPE, it is plausible that FIN13 uses similar tools for lateral movement. The use of web shells and custom malware for command execution and data exfiltration suggests a capability for lateral movement.
   - **Contextual Fit:** Given FIN13's focus on long-term intrusions and the use of various tools for different stages of the attack, it is reasonable to infer that they might use tools like Invoke-WMIExec and BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
