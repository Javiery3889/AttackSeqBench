### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Discovery**: The report highlights the discovery of various services on medical network perimeters, including:
  - Outdated Building Management systems.
  - Printers with unprotected web interfaces.
  - Medical devices like spirometers or blood pressure monitors that support the MQTT protocol and are discoverable online.
- **Others**: The report provides additional context about threats to medical networks, including:
  - Statistics on malware presence in medical organizations.
  - APT actors targeting pharmaceutical organizations using malware like PlugX and Cobalt Strike.
  - Recommendations for mitigating these threats.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After using Shodan and Censys to discover publicly available resources of medical organizations, is it likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover outdated Building Management systems or medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol in the medical networks' perimeters?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Shodan and Censys**: These are tools commonly used by cybercriminals to discover publicly available resources and vulnerabilities.
- **Discovery of Outdated Systems and Devices**: The CTI report explicitly mentions that outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol are discoverable online and are part of the medical networks' perimeters.
- **Likelihood**: Given that these systems and devices are discoverable and are known to be vulnerable, it is highly likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover them after using Shodan and Censys.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer
- **Reasoning**:
  1. The CTI report indicates that outdated Building Management systems and medical devices supporting the MQTT protocol are discoverable online.
  2. Shodan and Censys are tools that can be used to discover such publicly available resources.
  3. Cybercriminals are known to use these tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
  4. Therefore, it is highly likely that cybercriminals would proceed to uncover these systems and devices after using Shodan and Censys.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
