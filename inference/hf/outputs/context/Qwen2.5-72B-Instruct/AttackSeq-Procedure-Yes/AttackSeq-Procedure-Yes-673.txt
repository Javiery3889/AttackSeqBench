### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack begins with spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects.
   - **Execution:** The multi-stage infection framework 'Matryoshka' is used, involving a dropper, a loader, and a RAT component.
   - **Persistence:** The RAT ensures persistence by copying the reflective loader to common Windows folders, creating a registry key, and scheduling a task.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Anti-debugging, anti-sandboxing, and runtime API address resolution are used to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The RAT can steal Outlook passwords.
   - **Collection:** The RAT has screen grabbing and keylogging capabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** The RAT uses DNS protocol for C2 communication, constructing DNS queries with unique IDs, random strings, and obfuscated data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the CopyKittens group will perform data exfiltration over the DNS protocol after establishing DNS C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **DNS C2 Communication:** The report states that the RAT uses DNS queries to communicate with the C2 server, constructing queries with unique IDs, random strings, and obfuscated data.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the RAT has screen grabbing and keylogging capabilities, which are common methods for collecting sensitive data.
   - **DNS for Data Exfiltration:** While the report does not explicitly state that the group uses DNS for data exfiltration, it is a common technique in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to use DNS for both C2 and data exfiltration due to its stealth and the difficulty in detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CopyKittens group is described as a mid-level threat actor with a focus on stealth and effectiveness.
   - The use of DNS for C2 communication suggests a sophisticated approach to maintaining a low profile.
   - Given the RAT's capabilities for screen grabbing and keylogging, it is reasonable to infer that the group would use the same DNS channel for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid additional detection risks.
