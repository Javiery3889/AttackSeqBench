### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The adversaries used weaponized exploit documents to gain initial access, exploiting the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2012-0158.
     - A spear-phishing email was sent from an impersonated individual of the Russian-based organization Vigstar, containing a malicious document.
   - **Execution:**
     - The BBSRAT malware is executed by writing an embedded cab file to the %TEMP% directory.
     - It creates directories and writes three files: aclmain.sdb, pnipcn.dll, and ssonsvr.exe.
     - The legitimate Citrix executable ssonsvr.exe is used to sideload the malicious pnipcn.dll file.
     - The malware performs process hollowing on a suspended instance of msiexec.exe before resuming the process.
   - **Persistence:**
     - A registry key is written to run ssonsvr.exe on startup.
     - A downloader deploys a DLL to specific directories and sets corresponding registry keys to ensure the DLL loads on startup.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - BBSRAT communicates with the C2 server using HTTP or HTTPS requests.
     - It exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.
     - The C2 domains used are transactiona[.]com and futuresgold[.]com.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely to observe the malware exfiltrating additional compressed and encrypted data via POST requests to the C2 server after establishing command and control communication and exfiltrating initial data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that BBSRAT exfiltrates data about the victim's machine via POST requests.
   - The report does not provide specific details about the nature of the exfiltrated data (e.g., whether it is compressed and encrypted).
   - However, it is common for malware to exfiltrate additional data beyond initial system information, especially if the C2 communication is established and the malware is designed to gather more detailed information over time.
   - The use of POST requests for exfiltration is a standard technique in malware to avoid detection and ensure data is transmitted securely.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report confirms that BBSRAT exfiltrates data via POST requests.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that the data is compressed and encrypted, it is a reasonable assumption given the sophistication of the malware and the need to avoid detection.
   - The malware's persistence mechanisms and C2 communication suggest a long-term presence on the victim's system, which would likely involve additional data exfiltration.
