### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information.
     - Targets were defense and government-related organizations.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious documents with a macro were distributed.
     - The macro injected the Sharpshooter downloader into Word.
     - The downloader retrieved the Rising Sun implant from a control server.
   - **Execution:**
     - The macro executed shellcode that downloaded and executed the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, and OS product name from the registry.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The implant encrypted and obfuscated data before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Rising Sun implant is likely to communicate with control servers using HTTP POST requests after performing initial reconnaissance.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Discovery:**
     - The report states that the Rising Sun implant performed initial reconnaissance by fetching network adapter info, computer name, user name, IP address information, and OS product name from the registry.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report also states that the implant encrypted and obfuscated data before exfiltrating it to the control server via HTTP POST requests.
   - **Control Servers:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the specific control servers (34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php), but it does confirm that the implant communicates with control servers using HTTP POST requests.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Rising Sun implant performs initial reconnaissance to gather system information.
   - After gathering this information, the implant encrypts and obfuscates the data.
   - The implant then exfiltrates the data to the control server using HTTP POST requests.
   - The specific control servers mentioned in the question (34.214.99.20/view_style.php and kingkoil.com.sg/board.php) are not explicitly mentioned in the report, but the method of communication (HTTP POST requests) is confirmed.
