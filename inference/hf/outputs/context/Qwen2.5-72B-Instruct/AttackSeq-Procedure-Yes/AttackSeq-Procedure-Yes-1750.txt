### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** TG1021 conducted reconnaissance to identify target networks.
   - **Initial Access:** TG1021 gained initial access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks and a 0-day vulnerability.
   - **Execution:** TG1021 executed a memory-resident malware.
   - **Persistence:** TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory. They removed all disk-resident tools after use for stealth.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and used stealth techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
   - **Discovery:** TG1021 used tools like SharpHound and PowerSploit to map and scan targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** TG1021 accessed shared folders on internal web servers over SMB using compromised domain credentials and dropped the NodeIISWeb web shell loader via SMB.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that TG1021 established command and control (C2) by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, allowing NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence and Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that TG1021 used web shells and the NodeIISWeb malware for persistence and lateral movement. NodeIISWeb intercepts and handles HTTP requests, which suggests it has backdoor functionality.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report emphasizes that TG1021 used stealth techniques, including removing disk-resident tools and evading detection.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** While the report does not explicitly mention the use of inline hooks, the behavior of NodeIISWeb (intercepting and handling HTTP requests) aligns with the idea of providing backdoor functionality, which is a common method for establishing C2.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **NodeIISWeb Functionality:** NodeIISWeb is described as intercepting and handling HTTP requests, which is a common technique for maintaining a backdoor and establishing C2.
   - **Stealth Techniques:** The threat actor's focus on stealth and evading detection suggests they would use sophisticated methods to maintain C2, such as inline hooks.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The use of NodeIISWeb to drop web shells on other servers indicates a need for maintaining control over multiple compromised systems, which is typically achieved through C2 mechanisms.

### Final Answer
Given the behavior of NodeIISWeb and the threat actor's focus on stealth and persistence, it is likely that TG1021 established command and control by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process, allowing NodeIISWeb to provide backdoor functionality.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
