### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack began with a spearphishing email campaign that delivered a URL leading to an IP-address-based URL containing an executable and a decoy PDF.
   - **Execution:** The operators took control of the backdoor, executed commands, and downloaded additional malware.
   - **Persistence:** COM object hijacking and registry keys were used for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Files and processes were deleted and security tools were disabled.
   - **Credential Access:** Dumpers were used to target browsers and email clients for credential retrieval.
   - **Discovery:** Information about the victim's computer and environment was gathered.
   - **Collection:** Files with specific extensions were scanned, and data was staged for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with the C&C server used commonly used ports 80 or 443, and data was hex-encoded and encrypted with AES or a custom algorithm.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the file paths prepared for exfiltration were hex-encoded and encrypted using a known or custom algorithm before being sent to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery and Collection:** The report states that the malware gathered information about the victim's computer and environment, scanned for files with specific extensions, and staged data with paths of identified files to exfiltrate.
   - **Command and Control:** The report also mentions that data sent to the C&C server was hex-encoded and encrypted with AES or a custom algorithm.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the data sent to the C&C server was hex-encoded and encrypted.
   - Since the file paths are part of the data being exfiltrated, it is reasonable to conclude that they would also be hex-encoded and encrypted before being sent to the C&C server.
