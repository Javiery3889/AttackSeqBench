### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on servers.
   - **Execution:** The threat actors uploaded a variety of tools to the compromised servers, including legitimate applications and post-exploitation tools like Mimikatz. They also uploaded custom backdoors such as HyperBro.
   - **Persistence:** The actors installed webshells on SharePoint servers for persistence.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Emissary Panda used webshells to upload legitimate executables for DLL sideloading and used the China Chopper webshell to maintain access and evade defenses.
   - **Credential Access:** The actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Discovery:** The threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Emissary Panda moved laterally across the network using stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).
   - **Command and Control:** The HyperBro backdoor was used for command and control.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Emissary Panda uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors, such as HyperBro, to perform execution before scanning the network for subsequently vulnerable systems through tools targeting CVE-2017-0144.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that Emissary Panda gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-0604 and installed webshells.
   - **Execution:** The report states that the threat actors uploaded a variety of tools and custom backdoors, including HyperBro, to the compromised servers.
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that the threat group used tools to perform network reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that Emissary Panda moved laterally using stolen credentials and exploiting CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue).

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report. After gaining initial access and installing webshells, Emissary Panda uploaded tools and backdoors to perform execution. They then used these tools to perform network reconnaissance and identify vulnerable systems, which they exploited for lateral movement using CVE-2017-0144.
   - The report clearly states that the actors used tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials and performed network reconnaissance, which is consistent with the question's sequence.
