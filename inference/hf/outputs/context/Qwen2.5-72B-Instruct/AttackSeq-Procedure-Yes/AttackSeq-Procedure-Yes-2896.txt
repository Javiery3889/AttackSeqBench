### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The 'yty' framework uses a malicious Excel document named 'Circular.xls' with macros to execute an embedded executable.

**Execution:**
- The framework includes two downloaders: a stripped-down C++ program (Downloader 1) and a more functional downloader (Downloader 2) with anti-sandbox detection.

**Persistence:**
- A secondary macro in 'Circular.xls' ensures persistence for the 'Setup.exe' download.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The framework uses junk code, anti-sandbox detection, and creates logs for debugging.

**Collection:**
- The framework can collect files, take screenshots, and log keystrokes using plugins:
  - 'vstservice.exe' for document listing
  - 'abode.exe' for file exfiltration
  - 'mdriver.exe' for keylogging
  - 'dspcheck.exe' for taking screenshots
  - 'mboard.exe' for system information gathering

**Command and Control:**
- The framework uses a football-themed communication strategy to disguise C2 traffic. It downloads a file from Google Docs to get the C2 host and sends beacon messages containing system information. The C2 server responds with further instructions.

**Others:**
- The Donot Team is believed to be behind 'yty', and they mimic legitimate applications and services. Their TTPs, infrastructure, and malware code are similar to the EHDevel malware, indicating continuous improvement.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the 'yty' framework disguises its C2 communication using a football-themed strategy to exchange beacon messages and receive instructions, is it likely that the framework will exfiltrate data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots back to the C2 server using plugins like 'abode.exe'?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The 'yty' framework is capable of file collection, keylogging, and taking screenshots.
- It uses plugins like 'abode.exe' for file exfiltration.
- The framework communicates with the C2 server using a football-themed strategy and sends beacon messages containing system information.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly states that the 'yty' framework can collect and exfiltrate data such as file listings, keystrokes, and screenshots.
- The C2 communication is established and used to send beacon messages and receive instructions.
- Given the capabilities and the established communication channel, it is highly likely that the framework will use the plugins to exfiltrate the collected data back to the C2 server.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The 'yty' framework has the capability to collect various types of data (file listings, keystrokes, screenshots).
2. It uses specific plugins ('abode.exe', 'mdriver.exe', 'dspcheck.exe') for these collection tasks.
3. The framework establishes a C2 communication channel using a football-themed strategy.
4. The C2 server receives beacon messages and can send further instructions.
5. Given the established communication and the presence of data collection plugins, it is logical to conclude that the framework will exfiltrate the collected data back to the C2 server.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
