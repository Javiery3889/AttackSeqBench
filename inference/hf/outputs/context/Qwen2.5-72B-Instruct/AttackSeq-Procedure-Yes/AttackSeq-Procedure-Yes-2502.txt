### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The main attack vector is spear-phishing emails with malicious Word, Excel, or PDF attachments.
- These emails use social engineering and typo-squatting domains.
- The attachments use template injection to execute macro code, which downloads and executes malware.

**Execution:**
- The malware downloaded are .NET binaries protected with Yoda Obfuscator.
- These binaries unpack to reveal commercial RATs like RevengeRAT.
- Additional modules like ScreenBooking capture credit card data by monitoring web pages, specifically targeting booking.com.
- In ProCC campaigns, the malware are Delphi binaries with a customized backdoor capable of collecting data from the clipboard, printer spooler, and capturing screenshots.

**Credential Access:**
- The attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTAs).
- They sell credentials from compromised systems, providing remote access to hotel front desks.
- This allows other cybercriminals to steal credit card details from hotel administration software.

**Others:**
- The campaign has been active since at least 2015.
- It targets businesses in the hospitality sector.
- Kaspersky products detect this threat under various names, and IoCs are available on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After attackers leverage spear-phishing emails with malicious document attachments to gain initial access and execute RAT malware like RevengeRAT in the target environment, is it likely that they will collect credit card information from OTA websites during their operations?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments.
2. **Execution:** Macro code execution, downloading and executing RAT malware.
3. **Credential Access:** Capturing credit card data from hotel systems and OTAs.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The CTI report explicitly states that the attackers aim to capture credit card data from hotel systems and online travel agencies (OTAs).
  - The ScreenBooking module is specifically designed to capture credit card data by monitoring web pages, targeting booking.com, which is an OTA.
  - The attackers also sell credentials from compromised systems, allowing other cybercriminals to steal credit card details from hotel administration software, which can include OTA data.

- **B: No**
  - This choice contradicts the information provided in the CTI report, which clearly indicates that credit card data from OTAs is a target of the attackers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines that the attackers use RATs to capture credit card data from hotel systems and OTAs.
- The ScreenBooking module is specifically designed to monitor web pages and capture credit card data from booking.com, an OTA.
- The attackers also sell credentials from compromised systems, which can be used to steal credit card details from hotel administration software, including OTA data.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
