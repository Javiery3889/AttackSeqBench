### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Comfoo replaces the path to the DLL of an existing unused service to maintain persistence.
     - Comfoo can be delivered with a rootkit to hide its files.
     - Comfoo starts the "ipnat" system service to block remote maintenance.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Same as Execution.
   - **Collection:**
     - Comfoo RAT features include:
       - System/network information gathering
       - Keystroke logging
       - Screenshots
       - File upload/download/execute
       - Command shell

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Comfoo C2 server will host a rendezvous-type traffic relay program and the relay server will listen on multiple TCP ports for executing proxy-related tasks to establish command and control using encrypted HTTP requests.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Capabilities:**
     - The report confirms that Comfoo has capabilities for system/network information gathering, keystroke logging, screenshots, file management, and command shell.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of a rendezvous-type traffic relay program or the specific method of C2 communication (e.g., encrypted HTTP requests).
   - **Contextual Information:**
     - The report indicates that Comfoo has been in continuous development since 2006 and has been used in various APT campaigns. This suggests that the C2 infrastructure is likely to be sophisticated and adaptable.
   - **Common APT Practices:**
     - APT groups often use sophisticated C2 techniques to evade detection, including encrypted communication and relay servers to obfuscate the true C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state the use of a rendezvous-type traffic relay program or encrypted HTTP requests, the sophisticated nature of Comfoo and its long history of use in APT campaigns suggest that such advanced C2 techniques are likely.
   - APT groups often employ multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption to maintain control over their malware and avoid detection.
   - The features of Comfoo, such as file upload/download and command shell, indicate that it is capable of complex operations, which are often supported by advanced C2 infrastructure.
