### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- GreyEnergy targets energy companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland.
- Activities include backdoor access, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password and credential stealing.
- Targeting ICS control workstations running SCADA software and servers.

**Resource Development:**
- Modular malware framework.
- Mini backdoor deployed before admin rights are obtained.
- C&C servers are active Tor relays for covert communication.

**Initial Access:**
- Infection vectors: spearphishing and compromise of public-facing web servers.
- Lateral movement from compromised web servers to other workstations.

**Persistence:**
- Securely wipe malware components from victims' hard drives.

**Credential Access:**
- Use of common external tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner.

**Lateral Movement:**
- Deploy internal C&C proxies within the victims' networks to redirect requests to external C&C servers.

**Command and Control:**
- Internal C&C proxies facilitate stealthy communication.

**Others:**
- Linked to BlackEnergy and TeleBots.
- More modern toolkit with a focus on stealth.
- Some samples signed with a stolen certificate from Advantech.
- Deployed an early version of the TeleBots' NotPetya worm.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using spearphishing emails and compromising public-facing web servers to gain initial access, is GreyEnergy likely to implement stealth techniques including pushing only selected modules to selected targets and partially encrypting these modules using AES-256 before running some modules fileless in memory to hinder analysis and detection?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- **Modular Malware Framework:** GreyEnergy's malware is modular, and the functionality depends on the combination of modules uploaded to the victim systems.
- **Stealth Techniques:** GreyEnergy uses Tor relays for covert communication and securely wipes malware components from victims' hard drives.
- **Fileless Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the use of a mini backdoor and the focus on stealth suggest that GreyEnergy may use fileless techniques to avoid detection.
- **Encryption:** The report mentions the use of stolen certificates, which implies a focus on evading detection and maintaining operational security.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The modular nature of the malware and the focus on stealth align with the described techniques.
  - Pushing only selected modules to selected targets and partially encrypting these modules using AES-256 are consistent with the group's operational security practices.
  - Running some modules fileless in memory is a common technique to hinder analysis and detection, which fits with GreyEnergy's focus on stealth.
- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the described characteristics of GreyEnergy, which emphasize stealth and operational security.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- GreyEnergy's modular malware framework and focus on stealth suggest that they would use advanced techniques to avoid detection.
- The use of Tor relays and secure wiping of malware components indicates a high level of operational security.
- The deployment of a mini backdoor and the use of stolen certificates further support the likelihood of using fileless execution and encryption to hinder analysis and detection.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
