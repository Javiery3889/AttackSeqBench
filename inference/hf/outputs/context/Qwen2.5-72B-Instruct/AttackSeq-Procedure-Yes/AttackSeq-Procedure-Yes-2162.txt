### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT35 infiltrated a corporate device through a spear phishing email.
   - **Persistence:** The infected device exhibited persistent C2 beaconing, indicating that APT35 maintained a foothold within the system.
   - **Discovery:** Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected.
   - **Lateral Movement:** No lateral movement or data exfiltration occurred following the C2 beaconing detection.
   - **Command and Control:** Darktrace detected APT35's C2 activity, which included known malicious domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst automated the investigation process to analyze the infected device following the Command and Control detection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected. This indicates that the automated investigation process was indeed initiated following the detection of the C2 activity.
   - The report emphasizes the role of Darktrace's Cyber AI in automating the investigation process and reducing the time to triage by 92%.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT35 used a spear phishing email to gain initial access.
   - **Persistence:** The infected device maintained a persistent C2 connection.
   - **Discovery:** Darktrace's Cyber AI detected the C2 activity.
   - **Automated Investigation:** The report explicitly mentions that Darktrace's Cyber AI Analyst began analyzing the infected device once the C2 was detected, automating the investigation process.
