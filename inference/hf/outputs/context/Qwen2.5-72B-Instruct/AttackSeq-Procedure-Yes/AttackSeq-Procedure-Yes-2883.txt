### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Functions used: `LoadLibraryA`, `CreateProcessA`, `RtlNtStatusToDosError`, `LdrRegisterDllNotification`, `LdrUnregisterDllNotification`, `cmd.exe /C`, `powershell`.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Functions used: `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, `DeleteKey`.
     - Registry key: `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Functions used: `ZwWriteVirtualMemory`, `ZwWow64QueryInformationProcess64`, `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, `ZwProtectVirtualMemory`, `ZwMapViewOfSection`, `ZwCreateSection`, `ZwUnmapViewOfSection`, `ZwClose`.
     - Additional: `RtlNtStatusToDosError`.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS.
     - Strings: `Mozilla/5.0`, `Host:`, `http://`, `https://`, `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=%s`, `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="upload_file"; filename="%s"`.
   - **Others:**
     - Encoding and obfuscation techniques.
     - File paths and names manipulation.
     - Use of `runas` and `copy` commands.
     - ActiveX objects and Internet Explorer settings manipulation.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will query registry values using `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` as part of their discovery tactics after evading defenses using functions like `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64`, before establishing command and control through HTTP/HTTPS communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions the use of `ZwProtectVirtualMemory` and `ZwWow64ReadVirtualMemory64` for memory manipulation and process evasion.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` for querying registry values. However, it does mention the use of `CreateKey`, `SetStringValue`, `SetDWORDValue`, `GetBinaryValue`, `SetBinaryValue`, and `DeleteKey` for registry manipulation.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report clearly indicates the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols for command and control, with specific strings and mechanisms for data transmission.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that the threat actors query registry values using `GetStringValue` and `GetDWORDValue` as part of their discovery tactics. However, the use of registry manipulation functions suggests that they are interacting with the registry, which could include querying values.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report follows a logical flow: execution, persistence, defense evasion, and command and control. It is plausible that the threat actors would query registry values as part of their discovery tactics to gather information about the system before establishing command and control.
