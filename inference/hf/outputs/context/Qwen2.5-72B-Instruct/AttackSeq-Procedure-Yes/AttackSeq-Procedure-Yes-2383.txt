### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial access vector was a spear-phishing email with a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable.
   - **Execution:** The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable from the system32 folder and used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process.
   - **Defense Evasion:** TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file. The C2 server modified the payload to evade network security solutions.
   - **Discovery:** The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host, including system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands, with the C2 servers located in South Korea and Europe.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that TDrop2 would perform execution using process hollowing to evade detection before engaging in discovery activities such as gathering system information and network views.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report confirms that the initial access was via spear-phishing emails with trojanized installation executables.
   - **Execution:** The report states that TDrop2 executed a legitimate Windows executable and used process hollowing to inject malicious code, which is a technique to evade detection.
   - **Discovery:** The report also confirms that TDrop2 performed discovery activities by collecting system information and network views.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the sequence presented in the CTI report.
   - The initial access via spear-phishing emails is confirmed.
   - The execution using process hollowing to evade detection is explicitly mentioned.
   - The discovery activities, including gathering system information and network views, are also confirmed.
