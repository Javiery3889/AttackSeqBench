### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report mentions that Regin can use various infection vectors, including tricking targets into visiting spoofed websites or exploiting applications. It also mentions an instance where Regin was observed originating from Yahoo! Instant Messenger.
   - **Execution:** Regin's execution process is detailed through its multi-staged architecture:
     - **Stage 0:** The dropper installs Regin.
     - **Stage 1:** Loads a kernel driver that executes Stage 2.
     - **Stage 2:** Another kernel driver that extracts, installs, and runs Stage 3.
     - **Stage 3:** A kernel mode DLL that provides a framework for higher-level stages and loads Stage 4.
     - **Stage 4:** A user-mode orchestrator and multiple kernel payload modules stored in encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers.
     - **Stage 5:** The main Regin payload functionality, with files injected into services.exe by Stage 4.
   - **Persistence:** The report suggests that Regin is designed to maintain a long-term presence on infected systems, though specific mechanisms are not detailed.
   - **Credential Access:** Regin can steal passwords and monitor network traffic, including credential information.
   - **Discovery:** Regin gathers information on processes, memory utilization, and network traffic.
   - **Collection:** Regin has extensive collection capabilities, including RAT features, capturing screenshots, and monitoring network traffic.
   - **Command and Control:** Regin's C&C operations are extensive and bidirectional, using various transport protocols.
   - **Exfiltration:** Regin can exfiltrate data through various channels, including HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Regin will pass through multiple execution stages, specifically loading a kernel driver for Stage 2 and running a kernel-mode DLL in Stage 3, before employing advanced techniques like storing encrypted data blobs in the registry and extended attributes for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution Stages:**
     - **Stage 1:** Loads a kernel driver that executes Stage 2.
     - **Stage 2:** Another kernel driver that extracts, installs, and runs Stage 3.
     - **Stage 3:** A kernel mode DLL that provides a framework for higher-level stages and loads Stage 4.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that Regin uses encrypted virtual file system (EVFS) containers, which suggests advanced techniques for storing and protecting data.
     - However, the report does not explicitly mention storing encrypted data blobs in the registry or extended attributes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly outlines the multi-staged execution process of Regin, including the loading of kernel drivers and running kernel-mode DLLs.
   - While the report does not explicitly state that Regin stores encrypted data blobs in the registry or extended attributes, the use of EVFS containers and strong encryption suggests that Regin employs advanced techniques for defense evasion.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of Regin and its multi-staged architecture, it is reasonable to infer that it may use additional advanced techniques for defense evasion, even if not explicitly mentioned in the report.
