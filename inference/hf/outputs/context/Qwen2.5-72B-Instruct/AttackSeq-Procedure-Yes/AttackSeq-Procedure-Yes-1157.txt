### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** PROMETHIUM uses trojanized installation files of well-known applications to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The malware is deployed alongside legitimate applications, uses a service for persistence, and reconfigures Windows Defender to add exclusions for the malware's directories.
   - **Persistence:** A service is created to launch the C2 contact module upon service startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware checks for specific antiviruses (ESET or BitDefender) and adds its directories to the Windows Defender exclusions list.
   - **Command and Control:** The C2 infrastructure includes hardcoded domains and communicates over HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware exfiltrates encoded archives containing documents to the C2 server, using an unusual encoding scheme and splitting large files into chunks.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that PROMETHIUM will search for and exfiltrate Microsoft Office files and use a document search module to parse the hard drive for files with specific extensions during its collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that the malware exfiltrates encoded archives containing documents. This suggests that the malware does collect and exfiltrate documents.
   - **Document Search Module:** The report does not explicitly mention a document search module or the specific process of parsing the hard drive for files with specific extensions. However, the exfiltration of documents implies that the malware must have a way to identify and collect these documents.
   - **Microsoft Office Files:** While the report does not specify the types of documents exfiltrated, it is common for malware to target Microsoft Office files (e.g., .doc, .xls, .ppt) as they often contain valuable information.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The exfiltration of documents suggests that the malware has a mechanism to identify and collect files.
   - The use of an unusual encoding scheme and splitting of large files indicates a sophisticated approach to exfiltration, which is consistent with the use of a document search module.
   - Although the report does not explicitly state the use of a document search module, the behavior of exfiltrating documents strongly implies that such a module is likely present.
