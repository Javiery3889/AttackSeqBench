### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Stolen credentials were used to gain initial access.
     - SSH tools were used to set up remote tunneling.
     - Payload stagers (HTTP or reverse-DNS) were executed using scheduled tasks to download the backdoor.
   - **Execution:**
     - Malicious code was executed through various methods.
     - 64-bit backdoor deployed using scripts and encrypted files.
     - 32-bit backdoor used a custom VM-based payload loader (CostaBricks).
     - PowerShell loader (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection) injected the final payload DLL into memory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Process injection using Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.
     - Deobfuscation to decode files or information related to the SombRAT backdoor.
   - **Collection:**
     - SombRAT backdoor archived collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - SombRAT backdoor communicated with C2 servers using protocol tunneling over DNS and HTTP.
     - Traffic was SSL-encrypted and capable of bypassing HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies.
     - C2 domain name was hardcoded and obfuscated.
     - RSA encryption for AES key exchange.
     - Proxy tools like pcheck HTTP/S proxy, GO SOCKS5 proxy, and PuTTY were used.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Data exfiltrated over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the SombRAT malware will employ process discovery and system time discovery capabilities before archiving collected data using a custom storage file format.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions process injection and deobfuscation as defense evasion techniques.
   - **Collection:**
     - The report states that the SombRAT backdoor archives collected data using a custom storage file format.
   - **Process Discovery and System Time Discovery:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention process discovery or system time discovery capabilities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including initial access, execution, defense evasion, collection, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - While process injection and deobfuscation are mentioned as part of the defense evasion techniques, the report does not specify that the SombRAT backdoor employs process discovery or system time discovery capabilities.
   - The collection phase is clearly described as archiving collected data using a custom storage file format, but there is no mention of any activities related to process discovery or system time discovery before this step.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide evidence that the SombRAT backdoor employs process discovery or system time discovery capabilities before archiving collected data. Therefore, it is not likely that these capabilities are used in the described sequence.
