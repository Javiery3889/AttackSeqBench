### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT-TOCS used "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
     - A binary file named Sample A (Trojan/Win32.MSShell) was used to execute embedded malware using WinExec to call "powershell.exe".
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attack included running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, and the use of multi-beacon communication.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - APT-TOCS could laterally move within the internal network.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - APT-TOCS used encrypted data scripts downloaded by PowerShell for command and control.
     - Communication with compromised systems using HTTP GET requests and heartbeat packages in Cookie fields with 60-second intervals.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory without being written to the hard disk, before the attackers employed multi-beacon communication for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that "powershell.exe" was used to execute Shellcode scripts for remote control.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The report mentions that the attack included running in memory and no hard disk writing operations.
     - It also mentions the use of multi-beacon communication.
   - **Sequence:**
     - The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to infer that the Shellcode script functionalities were executed in memory to evade detection before the multi-beacon communication was employed.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - APT-TOCS gains initial access using "powershell.exe" to execute Shellcode scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Shellcode scripts are executed in memory to avoid detection.
     - No hard disk writing operations are performed.
     - Multi-beacon communication is used to further evade detection.
   - **Logical Sequence:**
     - The execution in memory (to avoid detection) logically precedes the use of multi-beacon communication (to further evade detection).
