### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The threat actor uses spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.
   - **Initial Access:** They use spear-phishing with documents containing remote content and exploits (CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-6352) and watering hole attacks with malicious PowerPoint documents.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware, including encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor uses encoded blobs to evade detection.
   - **Collection:** The file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions (doc, docx, ppt, pptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, pdf) and uploads them to the C2 server.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals and uses resilient communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Dropping Elephant backdoor is likely to iterate through password stores and steal the user's Google Chrome credentials after evading defenses by decoding encoded blobs into PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are decoded to PowerShell command line scripts to download additional malware. This aligns with the question's context.
   - **Collection:** The report specifies that the file-stealer module collects files with specific extensions and uploads them to the C2 server. However, it does not mention anything about iterating through password stores or stealing Google Chrome credentials.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report provides a detailed sequence of the attack, including the use of encoded blobs to evade detection and the collection of specific file types.
   - The collection phase focuses on documents and files with specific extensions, which are likely to contain sensitive information relevant to the threat actor's interests (diplomatic and economic entities).
   - There is no mention of the backdoor specifically targeting password stores or Google Chrome credentials. While it is possible that such activities could occur, the report does not provide evidence to support this.
