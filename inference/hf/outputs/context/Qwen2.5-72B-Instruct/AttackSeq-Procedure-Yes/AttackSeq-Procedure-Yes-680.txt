### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Stuxnet used the CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability to gain initial access via malicious .LNK files on removable drives.
   - **Execution:**
     - Stuxnet executed malicious code on local and remote systems, using a DLL packed with UPX and multiple resources.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Stuxnet installed kernel-mode drivers (MrxCls.sys and MrxNet.sys) and user-mode components, and modified system files and registry keys to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Stuxnet used MS10-073 and MS10-092 vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Stuxnet used rootkit functionality, stolen digital certificates, and patched system libraries to evade detection.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers using HTTP, encrypted communications, and predefined URLs, including both decoy and actual C&C server URLs.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Stuxnet is likely to use the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability and the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement after achieving persistence and before communicating with C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The report clearly states that Stuxnet achieved persistence by installing kernel-mode drivers and modifying system files and registry keys.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report does not mention the use of the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability or the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement. Instead, it describes how Stuxnet spread through the network using malicious .LNK files and USB drives.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The report states that Stuxnet communicated with C&C servers using HTTP and encrypted communications, sending data to predefined URLs.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report does not indicate that Stuxnet used the MS08-067 RPC vulnerability or the MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerability for lateral movement. The primary method of propagation described is through removable drives and malicious .LNK files.
   - The report does mention that Stuxnet spread through the network, but it does not specify the use of these particular vulnerabilities for lateral movement.
   - Given the detailed information provided in the report, it is more likely that Stuxnet used its primary propagation methods (malicious .LNK files and USB drives) rather than the MS08-067 RPC and MS10-061 Print Spooler vulnerabilities for lateral movement.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
