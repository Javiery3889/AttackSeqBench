### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits, often using a malicious Flash object in a PDF file.
   - **Execution:** The malware uses a loader similar to MiniDuke's, which has been updated over time.
   - **Persistence:** CosmicDuke creates a scheduled task and a Windows service to maintain persistence.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware targets various software to steal credentials and Windows credentials.
   - **Discovery:** It searches for specific files on hard drives and network drives.
   - **Collection:** CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updates.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to automatically upload collected information to remote servers via FTP using stored login credentials and contact live remote sites during the Exfiltration phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection Phase:** The report confirms that CosmicDuke uses a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to collect information.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report states that CosmicDuke communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests and uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltrating collected data and updating the malware. The configuration, including server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer and compressed using an algorithm similar to LZNT-1.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly indicates that CosmicDuke uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltrating collected data.
   - The configuration, which includes server IPs, URLs, and credentials, is embedded in the info-stealer, suggesting that the malware has the necessary information to automatically upload data to remote servers.
   - The use of stored login credentials is consistent with the embedded configuration.
