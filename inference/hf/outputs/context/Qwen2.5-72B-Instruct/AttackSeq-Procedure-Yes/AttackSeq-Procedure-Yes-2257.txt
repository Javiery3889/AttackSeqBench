### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack targets user credentials of Mexican banking institutions and is linked to a campaign targeting Brazilian banking institutions.
   - **Execution:** The COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level. This script downloads md.zip, which contains the main malware library DLL, the executable loader, and other services. It also creates a random variable, a folder in %Public%, extracts files from md.zip, renames them, and creates a file with specific contents.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The main malicious file 12.dll is protected with the VMProtect packer, making static analysis difficult.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware aims to steal bank credentials and accesses Outlook info to collect email accounts for BEC attacks.
   - **Collection:** The malware accesses Microsoft Outlook MAPI to collect contacts' email accounts and sends them to the cyber actors.
   - **Command and Control:** The PowerShell script communicates with specific domains to download malware and send collected data.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected email accounts are exfiltrated to the cyber actors through a POST web request.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the attack will proceed to execute a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level before ensuring persistence via startup folder shortcuts and scheduled tasks, after the delivery of the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.zip file via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT) in the Initial Access phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The CTI report does not explicitly mention the initial access method, but the question states that the initial access is via a phishing email impersonating Mexico's tax department (SAT).
   - **Execution:** The report clearly states that the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that the PowerShell script includes base64 coded text strings associated with startup persistence features, such as creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access is via a phishing email, which is a common method for delivering malware.
   - After the initial access, the COMPROBANTE FISCAL.bat file is executed, which in turn executes a PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level.
   - The PowerShell script then ensures persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder and manipulating scheduled tasks.

Given the sequence described in the CTI report, it is clear that the execution of the PowerShell script from the Internet to run at memory level occurs before the persistence mechanisms are set up.

### Final Answer: A: Yes
