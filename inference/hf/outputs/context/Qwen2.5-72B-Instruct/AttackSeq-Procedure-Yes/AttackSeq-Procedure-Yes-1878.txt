### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** They exploit external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** They use JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools for command execution and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** They use trojanized KeePass binaries, SIXPACK, and MAILSLOT for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They use ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities for stealth.
   - **Discovery:** They use native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They use WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** They collect data from network shared drives and stage it for exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:** They use proxies and various protocols for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** They exfiltrate data over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations using native OS binaries for reconnaissance before dumping LSASS process memory to obtain credentials.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery (Reconnaissance):** The report states that FIN13 uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance. This includes gathering information on network and host configurations.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that reconnaissance (discovery) would precede privilege escalation. Gathering information on network and host configurations is a crucial step before attempting to escalate privileges and extract credentials.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Reconnaissance (Discovery):** FIN13 uses native OS binaries and other tools to gather information on network and host configurations. This step is essential for understanding the victim's environment and identifying potential targets for further actions.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** After gathering the necessary information, FIN13 uses tools like ProcDump and Mimikatz to dump LSASS process memory and extract credentials. This step is necessary to gain higher privileges and access sensitive data.
   - **Logical Sequence:** It is logical and common in cyber attacks for reconnaissance to precede privilege escalation. Understanding the network and host configurations helps the attacker identify the best targets and methods for privilege escalation.
