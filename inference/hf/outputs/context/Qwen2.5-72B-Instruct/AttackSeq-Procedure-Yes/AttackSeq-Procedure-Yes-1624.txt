### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - APT28 scans for new targets, focusing on Ukraine and Spain.
     - Uses a python script, a database, scan bots, and a Django application for administration and reporting.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Uses spear phishing emails, typosquatted domains, and malicious iFrames.
     - First stage: dropper named runrun.exe.
   - **Execution:**
     - Second stage: dropper named winloat.exe.
     - Deploys tools like run.exe (password dumper), xp.exe (privilege escalation), and svehost.exe (proxy tool).
   - **Persistence:**
     - Changes file timestamps to 14/04/2008, 16:00.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Uses CVE-2014-4076 to gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Deploys run.exe (mimikatz-based) to dump passwords.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems.
     - Bots report back to a central server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates via HTTP on port 443 or 80.
     - Uses 3DES and RSA encryption.
     - Backdoor component: advstoreshell.dll.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates emails and files to the central server.
     - Stolen information includes .pst and .dbx files.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to deploy additional modules like pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server as part of data collection efforts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:**
     - APT28 uses geographically distributed bots to scan IP ranges and identify vulnerable systems.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - APT28 exfiltrates data such as emails and files to the central server.
     - The stolen information includes .pst and .dbx files.
   - **Data Collection:**
     - The report mentions that APT28 exfiltrates data, but it does not explicitly mention the use of a module like pr.dll for this purpose.
   - **Context:**
     - The report details the use of various tools and techniques for different stages of the attack, but it does not list pr.dll as one of them.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of APT28's activities, including reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - While the report mentions the exfiltration of data, it does not specifically mention the use of a module like pr.dll for this purpose.
   - The report lists other tools and components used by APT28, such as runrun.exe, winloat.exe, run.exe, xp.exe, svehost.exe, and advstoreshell.dll, but pr.dll is not among them.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report, it is reasonable to assume that if pr.dll were a significant part of APT28's data collection efforts, it would have been mentioned.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No
