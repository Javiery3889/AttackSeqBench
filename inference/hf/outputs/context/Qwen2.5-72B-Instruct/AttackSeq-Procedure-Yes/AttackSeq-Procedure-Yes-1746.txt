### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

- **Reconnaissance**: TG1021 identified targets.
- **Initial Access**: TG1021 gained access by exploiting internet-facing Windows IIS servers using deserialization attacks.
- **Execution**: TG1021 executed memory-resident malware.
- **Persistence**: TG1021 used web shells and a custom malware framework (NodeIISWeb) that operates in-memory. They removed disk-resident tools after use.
- **Privilege Escalation**: TG1021 used custom tools like PotatoEx.dll and ExtDLL.dll for privilege escalation.
- **Defense Evasion**: TG1021 interfered with logging mechanisms, evaded EDRs, and removed disk-resident tools.
- **Credential Access**: TG1021 modified login webpages to record credentials.
- **Discovery**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit loaded directly into memory to perform reconnaissance.
- **Command and Control**: TG1021 established C2 by deploying an inline hook on a validation function within the IIS request handling process.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that TG1021 would access shared folders on internal web servers over SMB and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers during the Lateral Movement phase.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Discovery Phase**: The report mentions that TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to perform reconnaissance and gather output files. This indicates that TG1021 was actively mapping the network and identifying potential targets.
- **Lateral Movement**: The report does not explicitly mention lateral movement, but it does describe the use of NodeIISWeb, which is a web shell loader. Web shells are often used to move laterally within a network.
- **Persistence and Defense Evasion**: TG1021's focus on stealth and avoiding detection (e.g., removing disk-resident tools) suggests that they would be cautious in their lateral movement to avoid detection.

Given the use of NodeIISWeb and the focus on stealth, it is plausible that TG1021 would use SMB to access shared folders and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers. This aligns with the goal of maintaining stealth and avoiding detection while expanding their foothold in the network.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Reconnaissance and Discovery**: TG1021 used SharpHound and PowerSploit to map the network and identify targets.
- **Lateral Movement**: The use of NodeIISWeb, a web shell loader, suggests that TG1021 would use it to move laterally within the network.
- **Stealth and Defense Evasion**: TG1021's focus on stealth and avoiding detection supports the idea that they would use SMB to access shared folders and drop the NodeIISWeb web shell loader to compromise additional servers.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
