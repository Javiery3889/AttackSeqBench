#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Charming Kitten used decoy websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.
- They used more than six unique servers to host these fake websites.
- The servers were used to control the phishing websites and collect stolen data.

**Key Points from the Question:**
- The question specifically mentions BelCloud Hosting Corporation as the provider of the servers.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report confirms that Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram.
- The report also mentions that they used multiple servers to host these websites.
- However, the report does not specify the hosting provider (BelCloud Hosting Corporation) for these servers.

**Contextual Information:**
- The report ties the group's activity to Iran through the NetBlock of the IP addresses, which included an Iranian company's website.
- This suggests that the servers used by Charming Kitten were likely hosted in or by entities with ties to Iran.

**Conclusion:**
- While it is plausible that Charming Kitten used fake websites impersonating Google services and Instagram, the specific mention of BelCloud Hosting Corporation is not supported by the CTI report.
- Given the strong ties to Iran, it is less likely that they would use a hosting provider with no known ties to Iran.
