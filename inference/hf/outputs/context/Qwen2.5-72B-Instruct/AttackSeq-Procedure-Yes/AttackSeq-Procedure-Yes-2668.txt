### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The OceanLotus backdoor is distributed via a zip file, which contains a decoy Word document icon. When the user opens the decoy, the Trojan executes.
   - **Execution:** The backdoor opens a hidden file and copies it to the executable path, replacing the application bundle.
   - **Persistence:** The backdoor creates a Launch Agent that runs at startup, copies itself to a location based on the user's UID, and launches itself as a service.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor avoids suspicious strings and uses a custom binary protocol with encryption.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol on TCP port 443, with encrypted communication and ephemeral keys.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after achieving persistence, the OceanLotus backdoor is likely to survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to its C2 server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report states that the backdoor creates a Launch Agent and copies itself to a location based on the user's UID, ensuring it runs at startup.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with the C2 server using a custom binary protocol with encryption. The communication involves receiving commands and sending back results.
   - **Surveying the System:** While the report does not explicitly state that the backdoor surveys the system, it is a common practice for advanced malware to gather system information to understand the environment and plan further actions. The use of a custom binary protocol and encrypted communication suggests that the backdoor is capable of sending detailed information back to the C2 server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given the advanced nature of the OceanLotus backdoor, its use of a custom binary protocol, and the fact that it communicates with the C2 server to receive and execute commands, it is highly likely that the backdoor will survey the victim's computer and send encrypted details about system information to the C2 server. This is a standard behavior for sophisticated malware to ensure it can maintain control and gather intelligence.
