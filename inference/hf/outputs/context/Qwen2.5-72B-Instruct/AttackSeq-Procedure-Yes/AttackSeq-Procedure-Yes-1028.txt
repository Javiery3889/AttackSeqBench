### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** The group uses scripting (Batch files, VBScript) and rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs. They also use CreateProcess to execute payloads from C&C servers and rely on user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** They register modules as scheduled tasks, use Registry Run keys, and the Startup folder. They also insert malicious macros into existing documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use obfuscation, modify registry keys to deactivate security mechanisms, and employ code signing with valid certificates. They deobfuscate and decrypt strings and add remote templates to documents.
   - **Discovery:** The backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They inject malicious macros into Word and Excel documents and use Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets.
   - **Command and Control:** The malware uses HTTP and HTTPS for C&C.
   - **Exfiltration:** Modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that after using the Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, the group will deploy scripts to automatically scan for sensitive documents as part of their collection activities.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files (e.g., Office documents) for future exfiltration. This indicates that the group has a mechanism to identify and collect sensitive documents.
   - **Lateral Movement and Collection:** The report also states that the group uses Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments to other targets within the same organization. This suggests that after gaining access to a new system, they are likely to continue their collection activities.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report confirms that the group's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server, indicating a continuous process of document collection and exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The group's backdoors are designed to automatically list interesting files, which aligns with the discovery phase.
   - After using the Outlook VBA macro for lateral movement, it is logical that the group would continue their collection activities on the newly compromised systems.
   - The continuous exfiltration of documents to the C&C server suggests that the group has a systematic approach to document collection and exfiltration.
