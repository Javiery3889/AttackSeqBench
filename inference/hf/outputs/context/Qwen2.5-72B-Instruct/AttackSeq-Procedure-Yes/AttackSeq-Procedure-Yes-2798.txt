### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Grandoreiro is distributed via spam emails, often using fake Java or Flash updates or exploiting current events like COVID-19.
   - **Persistence:** Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It uses various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, and file system path changes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, such as API hooking, process killing, firewall blocking, file system path changes, and virtual environment detection.
   - **Credential Access:** It can steal credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook.
   - **Command and Control:** It communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP, performing a handshake and checking for commands every few seconds.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Grandoreiro is likely to collect information such as usernames during its discovery phase before communicating with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory to ensure persistence.
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention a discovery phase where Grandoreiro collects usernames. However, it does mention that the malware is capable of stealing credentials from Google Chrome and data from Microsoft Outlook, which implies a form of discovery.
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that Grandoreiro communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK over HTTP and performs a handshake and checks for commands every few seconds.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report does not explicitly state that Grandoreiro collects usernames during a discovery phase before communicating with the C&C server. However, given that it is capable of stealing credentials and data, it is reasonable to infer that it might collect such information as part of its operations.
   - The sequence of events in the report suggests that after ensuring persistence, Grandoreiro would likely engage in credential access and other data collection activities before establishing a C&C connection. This is because the C&C communication is described as a subsequent step where it checks for commands and information about connected victims.
