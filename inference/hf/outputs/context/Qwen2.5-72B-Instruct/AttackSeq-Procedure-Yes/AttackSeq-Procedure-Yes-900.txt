### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The OceanLotus group (APT32) uses a custom downloader malware named 'KerrDown'.
- Delivery methods: 
  - Microsoft Office Documents with malicious macros.
  - RAR archives containing legitimate programs with DLL side-loading.
- RAR file names are in Vietnamese, indicating primary targets are in Vietnam or Vietnamese-speaking individuals.

**Execution:**
- The malicious Office document contains an image file with a message in Vietnamese, asking the victim to enable macros to view the contents.
- The document has two different base64 blobs inserted in separate tables, with the font size changed to 1 to potentially evade detection.
- Depending on the victim's system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), the appropriate base64 encoded blob is decoded and executed.

**Command and Control:**
- The final payload of KerrDown is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- The KerrDown downloader attempts to download the payload from a URL depending on the OS architecture of the victim machine.

**Others:**
- Compile timestamps suggest active use since March 2018.
- Working hours pattern: 9 AM to 6 PM GMT+7, indicating operations likely out of Vietnam or nearby countries.
- Broader geographic and industry-wide target base.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After decoding and executing the appropriate base64 encoded blob depending on the system architecture during the execution phase, is it likely that the KerrDown DLL will execute the payload in memory using process injection as part of its defense evasion tactic?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The document contains base64 encoded blobs that are decoded and executed based on the system architecture.
- The final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon.
- Cobalt Strike Beacon is known for its advanced capabilities, including process injection for defense evasion.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - Cobalt Strike Beacon is a sophisticated tool that often uses process injection to execute payloads in memory, which is a common defense evasion technique.
  - Given the advanced nature of the threat actor (OceanLotus) and the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon, it is highly likely that they would employ such techniques to evade detection.
- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the KerrDown DLL does not use advanced techniques like process injection, which is less likely given the sophistication of the threat actor and the use of Cobalt Strike Beacon.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the final payload is a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon, a tool known for its advanced capabilities.
- Process injection is a common technique used by Cobalt Strike Beacon to execute payloads in memory and evade detection.
- Given the sophistication of the OceanLotus group and their use of advanced tools, it is highly likely that they would employ such techniques.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
