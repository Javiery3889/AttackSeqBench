### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with spear phishing emails containing infected document files with OLE binary objects.
   - **Execution:** The multi-stage infection framework 'Matryoshka' is used:
     - **First Stage:** A dropper (SCR PE file) obfuscates code and signals to the C2 server.
     - **Second Stage:** A Reflective Loader uses anti-debugging, anti-sandboxing, runtime API address resolution, and covert DLL injection.
     - **Third Stage:** The RAT component ensures persistence, establishes DNS C2 communication, and provides RAT functionalities.
   - **Persistence:** The RAT component ensures persistence by:
     - Copying the reflective loader to common Windows folders.
     - Creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot.
     - Scheduling a task named 'Microsoft Boost Kernel Optimization' to rerun the injection routine every 20 minutes.
     - Using a global mutex to prevent multiple instances from causing instability.
   - **Credential Access:** The RAT can steal Outlook passwords.
   - **Collection:** The RAT has screen grabbing and keylogging capabilities.
   - **Command and Control:** The RAT uses DNS protocol for C2 communication, with obfuscated data and substitute ciphers.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated over the DNS protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the CopyKittens group will use a global mutex to reduce the risk of multiple RAT instances running simultaneously after ensuring persistence by creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report explicitly states that the RAT component of the Matryoshka framework ensures persistence by:
     - Creating a registry key for automatic execution upon system boot.
     - Scheduling a task to rerun the injection routine every 20 minutes.
     - Using a global mutex to prevent multiple instances from causing instability.
   - The use of a global mutex is mentioned as a method to prevent multiple instances of the RAT from running simultaneously, which aligns with the question's context.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the RAT component uses a global mutex to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously.
   - This is a common technique in malware to ensure stability and avoid detection by security systems.
   - The use of a global mutex is a logical and practical step to take after ensuring persistence, as it helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the infection.
