### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Deployed loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) via a registry key.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
     - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placed a copy of the loader/spreader malware in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Set a registry key for automatic execution.
     - Attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Attempted to kill specific antivirus processes using taskkill.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
     - Packed backdoor malware with Themida to evade analysis and detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Copied the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
     - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses to establish connections to SMB shares.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Backdoor malware communicated with remote C&C servers.
     - Expected a command line parameter specifying the C&C address and port number.
     - Polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute and maintained a communication session.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files, disrupting the bank's operations during the heist.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or any actions to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files.
   - The report focuses on the initial stages of the attack, including the deployment of malware, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - The use of ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files is a common tactic to prevent recovery, but it is not mentioned in the provided report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report details the initial stages of the attack, including the deployment of backdoor malware and communication with C&C servers.
   - While the Lazarus group is known for using ransomware in other attacks, the specific report does not mention the use of Hermes ransomware in this particular heist.
   - The report's focus is on the initial compromise and the establishment of a foothold within the network, rather than the final stages of the attack that might involve data destruction or ransomware deployment.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide evidence that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to delete Volume Shadow Copies and backup files during the FEIB heist. The report focuses on the initial stages of the attack, including the deployment of malware, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control. Therefore, it is not likely that Hermes ransomware was used in this specific attack based on the information provided.
