### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Adversaries use scanning tools like masscan and public search engines to find misconfigurations and vulnerable hosts.
   - **Resource Development:** Attackers use compromised websites and domains for C2 servers and to store malicious files.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploitation of misconfigured Docker API ports and typo-squatting of popular software to trick developers.
   - **Execution:** Use of command and script interpreters to execute malicious commands and scripts.
   - **Persistence:** Techniques like LD_PRELOAD and creation of new user accounts with RSA keys.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Use of hostPath mount and chroot to gain persistence on the host.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Removal of security software and use of obfuscation techniques.
   - **Credential Access:** Collection of credentials using open-source tools and creation of hidden user accounts.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of proxy tools and legitimate external websites for C2 communication.
   - **Impact:** Mainly cryptocurrency mining, but also backdoors, malware deployments, and credential theft.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that attackers will automatically exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server after establishing contact by downloading shell scripts and encoding malicious binary files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Resource Development:** These stages focus on finding and setting up the infrastructure for the attack.
   - **Initial Access and Execution:** These stages involve gaining access and executing initial malicious commands.
   - **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** These stages ensure the attackers maintain control and escalate their privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** These techniques help avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** This stage involves collecting credentials, which aligns with the question.
   - **Command and Control:** This stage involves establishing communication with C2 servers, which is also relevant to the question.
   - **Impact:** The main impact is cryptocurrency mining, but credential theft is also mentioned.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report mentions that attackers use open-source tools to collect credentials and create hidden user accounts.
   - The report also states that attackers use C2 servers to download malicious code and establish communication.
   - Given that credential theft is a part of the attack sequence and that C2 servers are used for communication, it is plausible that attackers would exfiltrate AWS credentials over the C2 server as part of their attack sequence.
