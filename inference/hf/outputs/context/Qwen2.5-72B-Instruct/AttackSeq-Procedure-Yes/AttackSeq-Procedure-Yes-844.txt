### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - WinDealer executes by reading its configuration from a file under `C:\ProgramData`.
     - It loads a DLL module into memory.
     - It steals information from the victim's PC, including network configuration and SNS application details.
     - It saves stolen data with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Configuration files are encoded using XOR with the key "b6a7%7486".
     - Communication with C2 servers is encrypted using AES and RSA.
     - Stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Discovers information about the infected PC and network configuration.
     - Collects data from SNS applications.
     - Stages stolen data in a folder under `%TEMP%`, encrypting it with AES before sending it to a C2 server.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collects data from USB memory, documents, desktop items, recycle bin contents, and SNS application folders.
     - Processes collected data into ".a" files and categorizes them into different directories based on data type.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     - Encrypts an AES key with RSA and sends it to the C2 server.
     - Receives commands from the C2 server and sends results back after encryption.
     - Communicates with non-existent domains and uses icanhazip[.]com for IP address verification.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if WinDealer is likely to stage the data in the `%TEMP%` directory and encrypt it before exfiltrating it to a C2 server using communication channels over UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Staging Data in %TEMP% Directory:**
     - The report explicitly states that WinDealer saves stolen data with a ".a" extension in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - **Encrypting Data:**
     - The report mentions that stolen information is encrypted using AES128bit ECB mode before transmission.
   - **Exfiltration to C2 Server:**
     - The report specifies that WinDealer communicates with C2 servers using UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556.
     - It also mentions that the malware encrypts an AES key with RSA and sends it to the C2 server, and then sends the results back after encryption.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that WinDealer stages the stolen data in the `%TEMP%` directory.
   - The report also confirms that the data is encrypted before exfiltration.
   - The communication with C2 servers is done over UDP port 6999 or TCP port 55556, as specified in the question.
