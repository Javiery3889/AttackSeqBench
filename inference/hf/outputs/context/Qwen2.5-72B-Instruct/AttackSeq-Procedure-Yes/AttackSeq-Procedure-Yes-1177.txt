### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Malicious delivery documents with social engineering to trick victims into enabling macros.
     - Payloads are either embedded in the document or downloaded from the internet.
   - **Execution:**
     - Macros are enabled, leading to the execution of the payload.
     - Two files are created in the ProgramData directory in randomly-named directories.
     - A VBS script is used to execute a PowerShell script.
     - The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler for persistence.
     - In some campaigns, additional files are dropped, including a base64 encoded text file.
     - The latest change involves dropping three files: an .sct scriptlet file, an .inf file, and a base64 encoded data file.
     - The scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.
     - The PowerShell script is heavily obfuscated and divided into three parts.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - **Collection:**
     - The backdoor function collects machine information and takes screenshots.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communication with the C&C server is done via XML messages.
     - The backdoor queries internet services to get the machine's IP address and location.
     - The communication is encrypted using a simple RSA algorithm.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the campaigns use obfuscation processes and tools like publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker as part of their Defense Evasion tactics.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation:**
     - The report mentions that the PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation.
   - **Bypassing AppLocker:**
     - The report explicitly states that the scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing AppLocker.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that the attackers use obfuscation techniques in the PowerShell script.
   - The report also explicitly mentions the use of publicly available code to bypass AppLocker.
   - Both of these techniques are part of the Defense Evasion tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
