### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report
- **Initial Access**: The report describes two main initial access methods:
  - **SolarWinds Compromise**: The attackers deployed the Sunburst backdoor on the networks of over 18,000 customers.
  - **HAFNIUM Exploits**: HAFNIUM exploited four zero-days in Exchange Server for initial access.

- **Further Exploitation**: The report mentions that the initial access allowed for further exploitation, but it does not provide specific details on the methods used for further exploitation.

#### 2. Analyze the Question
- **Question**: After compromising SolarWinds and delivering the Sunburst backdoor through a supply-chain attack for initial access, is it likely that the Sunburst backdoor will communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation?
- **Answer Choices**:
  - A: Yes
  - B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate
- **Sunburst Backdoor**: The Sunburst backdoor was deployed as part of a sophisticated supply-chain attack. Backdoors are typically designed to maintain persistent access and facilitate further exploitation.
- **C2 Communication**: For a backdoor to be effective, it needs to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server to receive instructions and exfiltrate data. This communication is a common and essential part of the attack lifecycle.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: The use of a C2 server is a well-documented technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework under the "Command and Control" tactic.

#### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Access**: The Sunburst backdoor was delivered through a supply-chain attack, compromising SolarWinds.
2. **Purpose of Backdoor**: The primary purpose of a backdoor is to maintain access and facilitate further exploitation.
3. **C2 Communication**: For the backdoor to maintain access and receive further instructions, it must communicate with a C2 server.
4. **Common Practice**: C2 communication is a standard technique used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors to control compromised systems.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
