### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
     - Malicious Flash objects in PDF files exploit CVE-2011-0611.
     - Executable files are disguised as images or documents.
   - **Execution:**
     - Uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
     - Loader updates and compilation dates are noted.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service'.
     - Installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup'.
     - Copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Steals credentials from various software and Windows.
     - Exports certificates and private keys.
   - **Discovery:**
     - Searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
     - Targets non-English filenames with specific patterns.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
     - Uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Uploads collected data to remote servers via FTP.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if CosmicDuke is likely to use a keylogger, screenshotter, and clipboard stealer to gather information before exfiltrating the collected data to remote servers via FTP.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger, Screenshotter, and Clipboard Stealer:**
     - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers.
     - The report focuses on credential access and file discovery, but does not detail the specific methods used for real-time data collection.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The report clearly states that CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected data via FTP.
     - The exfiltration process is detailed, including the use of FTP servers and the structure of the remote sites.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While CosmicDuke is known for its comprehensive data collection and exfiltration capabilities, the CTI report does not provide explicit evidence of keyloggers, screenshotters, or clipboard stealers.
   - The report focuses on credential theft and file discovery, which are different methods of data collection.
   - Given the lack of specific mention of these tools in the report, it is less likely that CosmicDuke uses them in the described attack sequence.
