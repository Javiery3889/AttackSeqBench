### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries. They map victim networks and capture credentials.
   - **Initial Access:** Web shells and custom malware (BLUEAGAVE, SIXPACK) are used to establish a foothold.
   - **Execution:** JSPRAT, BLUEAGAVE, and other tools are used for command execution, file transfer, and network traffic proxying.
   - **Persistence:** Trojanized KeePass, SIXPACK, SWEARJAR, and MAILSLOT are used for persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil are used for privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Passive backdoors, custom droppers, and legitimate utilities are used for stealth.
   - **Credential Access:** LSASS memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass are used to obtain credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR are used for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Data is collected from network shared drives and staged locally or remotely.
   - **Command and Control:** Proxies, application layer protocols, and non-application layer protocols are used for C2.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated over web services using web shells and JSP tools.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations before staging collected data from network shared drives for fraudulent transactions after executing lateral movement using WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** The report states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely.
   - **Reconnaissance and Collection:** The report indicates that FIN13 maps victim networks and captures credentials, which suggests they gather information on network and host configurations as part of their reconnaissance and collection activities.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Lateral Movement:** FIN13 uses WMI and custom web shells like BUSTEDPIPE to move laterally within the network.
   - **Gathering Information:** Given their focus on long-term intrusions and mapping victim networks, it is highly likely that FIN13 will gather information on network and host configurations to understand the environment better and identify valuable data sources.
   - **Staging Data:** After gathering the necessary information, FIN13 will stage the collected data from network shared drives for exfiltration and fraudulent transactions.
