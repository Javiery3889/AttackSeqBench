### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Rocket Kitten uses spear phishing and social engineering to gain initial access. They use fake accounts and identities, and the spear-phishing email contains a link or file that, when clicked or opened, delivers a payload.
   - **Execution:** They use various malware, including a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) that logs keystrokes and connects to victims' Gmail accounts.
   - **Persistence:** They repeatedly attack the same targets, using new cover stories and techniques. They also perform numerous password-reset attempts.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They use fake identities, breach websites to set up phishing pages, and use anti-debugging and obfuscation techniques.
   - **Command and Control:** Infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download malware and monitor communications.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if, after using a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts (Credential Access), Rocket Kitten is likely to establish communication with a C&C server to download malware or monitor the victim's communications.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Keylogger and Credential Access:** The report mentions that Rocket Kitten uses a keylogger to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts, which is a form of Credential Access.
   - **C&C Communication:** The report explicitly states that infected computers communicate with a C&C server to download malware and monitor communications.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) is used to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts, which aligns with the Credential Access tactic.
   - After gaining access to additional accounts, it is logical for the attackers to establish communication with a C&C server to further their attack. The report clearly states that the C&C server is used to download malware and monitor communications.
   - The sequence of TTPs (Keylogger for Credential Access followed by C&C communication) is consistent with the attack pattern described in the report.
