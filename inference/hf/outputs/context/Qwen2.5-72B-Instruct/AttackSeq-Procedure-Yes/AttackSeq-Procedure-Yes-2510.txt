### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **Web Service Compromise:** Attackers target self-hosted web services to gain initial access.
- **Spearphishing:** Use of spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver "GreyEnergy mini."

**Post-Initial Access:**
- **Network Mapping:** Use of Nmap to map the network.
- **Credential Collection:** Use of Mimikatz to collect passwords.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Obtain domain administrator privileges.
- **Network Control:** With domain admin privileges, control the entire network.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After compromising a computer using GreyEnergy mini and using tools like Nmap and Mimikatz to map the network and collect credentials, is it likely that the GreyEnergy group will use SysInternals PsExec and WinExe tools to perform lateral movement across a compromised network?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Web service compromise or spearphishing.
2. **Initial Backdoor:** Deployment of "GreyEnergy mini."
3. **Network Mapping:** Use of Nmap.
4. **Credential Collection:** Use of Mimikatz.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** Obtain domain admin privileges.
6. **Network Control:** Control the entire network.

**Lateral Movement:**
- The report does not explicitly mention the use of SysInternals PsExec and WinExe for lateral movement.
- However, it is common for attackers to use these tools for lateral movement once they have obtained the necessary credentials and privileges.

**Contextual Information:**
- The GreyEnergy group uses standard tools for network mapping and credential collection.
- Given their use of Nmap and Mimikatz, it is reasonable to assume they would use other standard tools for lateral movement.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The GreyEnergy group has already used standard tools like Nmap and Mimikatz for network mapping and credential collection.
2. Once they have obtained domain admin privileges, they need to move laterally across the network to control it.
3. SysInternals PsExec and WinExe are widely used and effective tools for lateral movement.
4. Given the group's use of standard tools, it is highly likely they would use these tools for lateral movement.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
