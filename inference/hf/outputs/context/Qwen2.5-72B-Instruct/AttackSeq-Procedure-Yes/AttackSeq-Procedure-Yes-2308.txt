### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The adversary uses credentials obtained from previous breaches to perform credential stuffing or password spraying attacks against remote services.
   - **Execution:** The adversary installs Cobalt Strike using PowerShell and relies on scheduled tasks for execution.
   - **Persistence:** The adversary loads the Cobalt Strike beacon in memory and uses high-uptime systems for persistent access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The adversary uses password spraying to gain domain admin access and uses tools like NtdsAudit to dump password hashes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The adversary clears event logs, deletes files, and uses timestomping to cover their tracks.
   - **Credential Access:** The adversary uses credential stuffing and password spraying to gain access.
   - **Discovery:** The adversary uses tools like PsLogList to discover privileged users and their activities.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike's built-in lateral movement capabilities to move to domain controllers and other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The adversary uses Cobalt Strike for C2, initially with DNS and later with HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates small amounts of data via the C2 channel and larger amounts using custom tools to cloud storage services.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the adversary would collect email messages from both local and remote systems after identifying privileged users during the discovery phase using PsLogList.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The adversary uses PsLogList to export Security Event logs, which can help identify if privileged users are active on the systems.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The adversary moves laterally to other systems, including domain controllers, to identify and access data of interest.
   - **Exfiltration:** The adversary exfiltrates data, including mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property, using custom tools to cloud storage services.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - **Identifying Privileged Users:** The use of PsLogList to identify privileged users suggests that the adversary is interested in gaining access to systems where these users are active.
   - **Data of Interest:** The report mentions that the adversary is interested in data such as mailboxes and network shares containing intellectual property.
   - **Collection Activities:** Given that the adversary uses custom tools to exfiltrate large amounts of data, including mailboxes, it is reasonable to infer that they would collect email messages from both local and remote systems where privileged users are active.
