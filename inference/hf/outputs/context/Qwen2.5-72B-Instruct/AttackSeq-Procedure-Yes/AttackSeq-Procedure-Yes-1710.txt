### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Turla spyware infects government computers, suggesting an Initial Access tactic.
   - **Persistence:** Turla establishes a hidden foothold in infected networks to maintain persistent access.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Turla uses encryption and a rootkit to hide its tracks and maintain control of infected networks. It creates a hidden, encrypted file system to store stolen data and tools.
   - **Command and Control:** Turla uses multiple command and control servers to control infected systems and regularly updates its code to avoid detection.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Turla is likely to include document stealers in its specialized tools for collecting data from information repositories after using its encrypted file system for defense evasion.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that Turla uses a hidden, encrypted file system to store stolen data and tools. This indicates that Turla is sophisticated in its methods to avoid detection and maintain control.
   - **Data Collection:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of document stealers. However, given that Turla is a spyware and is part of a global cyber spying operation, it is reasonable to infer that it would use various tools to collect data, including document stealers.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report emphasizes the sophistication and persistence of Turla, suggesting that it would employ a wide range of tools to achieve its objectives, including data exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Turla is described as a sophisticated malware with a focus on espionage.
   - The use of an encrypted file system for defense evasion aligns with the need to store and manage stolen data and tools.
   - Given the nature of Turla's operations and its goal of collecting sensitive information, it is highly likely that it would include document stealers to gather data from information repositories.
   - The report's emphasis on Turla's persistence and evasion techniques supports the idea that it would use a comprehensive set of tools to achieve its objectives.
