### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The actor uses an email attachment as the initial infection vector, prompting the target to open a .src file, display a decoy document, and execute the malware.
   - **Execution:** The malware allows the operator to execute arbitrary code on the infected host.
   - **Persistence:** The malware achieves persistence through various methods, including dropping files in system directories and creating shortcuts in the startup folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware has evolved to use a dual file structure and advanced decoy documents. It checks for the presence of files used in previous versions.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware steals keystrokes and credentials from browsers.
   - **Command and Control (C2):** The malware communicates with C2 domains using HTTP connections hosted by a free web hosting provider, connecting to specific URIs.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the malware is likely to steal files from the local system as part of its collection process before uploading the stolen data to the C2 infrastructure.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Exfiltration:** The report explicitly states that the malware uploads stolen data, such as keystrokes and screenshots, to the C2 infrastructure. However, it does not explicitly mention the theft of local files.
   - **Credential Access:** The report mentions that the malware steals keystrokes and credentials from browsers, which suggests that it is capable of collecting data from the local system.
   - **Contextual Information:** The malware's capabilities and infrastructure have evolved over time, including the addition of remote administration features. This suggests that the malware has the capability to perform additional data collection tasks beyond just keystrokes and screenshots.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware is capable of stealing keystrokes and credentials, which are forms of data collection.
   - The report mentions that the malware uploads stolen data to the C2 infrastructure, but it does not explicitly state that it steals files from the local system.
   - However, given the malware's evolution and the addition of remote administration features, it is reasonable to infer that the malware might have the capability to steal files from the local system as part of its collection process.
   - The question asks if it is likely that the malware will steal files from the local system before uploading the stolen data. Given the malware's advanced capabilities and the context of its evolution, it is plausible that it would include file theft as part of its data collection process.
