### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate `netd` and is executed by `init`, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate `netd` at `/system/bin/netd` and executing the legitimate process backed up at `/system/bin/netd_`.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The malware executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** The malware scrapes multiple files containing credentials and key information and uses `tcpdump` to monitor network traffic.
   - **Collection:** The `netd` component collects files from the local system based on a predefined list of file extensions and from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - **Command and Control:** The `db` component provides SCP functionality, and `td` provides a Tor hidden service relaying connections to SSH.
   - **Exfiltration:** The `netd` component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** The malware replaces the legitimate `netd`, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Infamous Chisel is likely to enumerate data directories to discover files of interest and collect GPS information before automatically exfiltrating these files using Tor hidden service and SSH connections.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that Infamous Chisel's `netd` component collects files from application and data directories containing communication data. This implies that the malware is already collecting files from these directories.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report also states that the `netd` component exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Enumeration and GPS Information:** The report does not explicitly mention that the malware enumerates data directories to discover files of interest or collects GPS information. However, the collection of files from application and data directories containing communication data suggests that the malware is capable of discovering and collecting files of interest.
   - **Plausibility:** Given that the malware is already collecting files from application and data directories, it is plausible that it could enumerate these directories to discover files of interest, including GPS information, before exfiltrating them.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The malware collects files from application and data directories containing communication data.
   - The malware exfiltrates these files using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - While the report does not explicitly mention enumeration or GPS information, the capability to collect files from these directories suggests that enumeration and collection of GPS information are plausible.
