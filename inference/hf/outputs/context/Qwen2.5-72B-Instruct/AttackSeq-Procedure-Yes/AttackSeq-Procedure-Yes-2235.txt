### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The Rocket Kitten Group uses spear phishing and social engineering.
- They establish contact through fake accounts and identities, using platforms like Google Drive, Gmail, and Facebook.
- The spear-phishing email contains a link or file that, when clicked or opened, delivers a payload to take over the target machine.

**Execution:**
- They use various malware types, including simple tools they developed and more advanced, publicly available ones.
- They use a keylogger (TSPY_WOOLERG) to log keystrokes and connect to victims' Gmail accounts.
- They install other malware as needed.

**Persistence:**
- They repeatedly attack the same targets with new cover stories and techniques.
- They execute numerous password-reset attempts to overwhelm targets.
- They prefer targeting private email addresses and accounts.

**Credential Access:**
- They use social engineering and spear phishing to steal credentials.
- They take over accounts immediately after obtaining passwords.
- They use a keylogger to capture keystrokes and gain access to additional accounts.

**Command and Control:**
- Infected computers communicate with a C&C server.
- The C&C server can download additional malware and monitor communications.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if it is likely that Rocket Kitten will:
1. Use spear-phishing emails containing malicious payloads for initial access.
2. Use both simple and advanced tools during execution.
3. Use debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The CTI report clearly states that Rocket Kitten uses spear-phishing emails containing malicious payloads for initial access. This aligns with the first part of the question.

**Execution:**
- The report mentions that Rocket Kitten uses both simple and advanced tools during execution. This aligns with the second part of the question.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report does not mention the use of debugger evasion techniques. The focus is on the use of keyloggers and other malware, but there is no specific mention of techniques to evade debuggers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms the use of spear-phishing emails for initial access and the use of both simple and advanced tools during execution.
- However, the report does not provide any information about the use of debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion.

Given the information provided in the CTI report, it is not likely that Rocket Kitten will employ debugger evasion techniques for defense evasion, as this is not mentioned in the report.

**Final Answer: B: No**
