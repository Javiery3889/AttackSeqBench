### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The campaign used job recruitment techniques to gather information on potential targets.
   - **Initial Access:** Malicious documents with a macro were distributed, which injected the Sharpshooter downloader into memory and retrieved the Rising Sun implant.
   - **Execution:** The macro executed shellcode that downloaded and executed the second-stage payload and a decoy document.
   - **Persistence:** The Rising Sun implant ensured persistence by downloading the second-stage binary to the startup folder.
   - **Discovery:** The implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - **Command and Control:** The implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with data encrypted using RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the Rising Sun implant would use RC4 stream encryption and Base64 encoding to facilitate data exfiltration to the control server after performing initial reconnaissance and communicating with control servers using the same methods.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report clearly states that the Rising Sun implant communicated with control servers using HTTP POST requests, with data encrypted using RC4 and obfuscated with Base64 encoding.
   - The report also mentions that the implant performed initial reconnaissance by collecting system and network details.
   - Given that the implant already uses RC4 and Base64 for communication with the control server, it is highly likely that the same methods would be used for data exfiltration to maintain consistency and avoid detection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The implant's communication with the control server is already established using RC4 and Base64.
   - The use of consistent encryption and encoding methods is a common practice in malware to maintain stealth and avoid detection.
   - The report does not indicate any change in the communication methods after the initial reconnaissance, suggesting that the same methods would be used for data exfiltration.
