### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with links to download compressed files or zipped files containing malware.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components, which then decrypt and execute the actual Machete malware.
   - **Persistence:** Creation of Windows Task Scheduler tasks and use of hidden files and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading file and task names.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions and exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, producing file listings, and enumerating processes.
   - **Collection:** Stealing clipboard contents, copying files, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and staging data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP ports for communication with C&C servers, with fallback to HTTP for exfiltration if FTP is unavailable.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Machete used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers before exfiltrating encrypted data to remote servers after collecting data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that Machete collected data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes, and staged this data in a temporary folder.
   - **Command and Control:** The report also states that Machete used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers and for exfiltrating data.
   - **Sequence:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that after collecting data, the malware would communicate with the C&C server to exfiltrate the data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Data Collection:** Machete collects data by stealing clipboard contents, capturing screenshots, and logging keystrokes.
   - **Staging Data:** The collected data is staged in a temporary folder.
   - **Communication with C&C:** The malware uses FTP and HTTP ports to communicate with the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:** The data is exfiltrated to remote servers using the same communication channels (FTP and HTTP).

Given the logical sequence of events and the information provided in the report, it is highly likely that Machete used FTP and HTTP ports for communication with its C&C servers before exfiltrating the encrypted data to remote servers.
