### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Weaponized RTF file exploiting RoyalRoad tool to drop 'intel.wll' loader.
- Archive files with a legitimate executable and a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
- Direct delivery via an executable file serving as a loader.

**Execution:**
- Aria-body loader establishes persistence, injects itself into processes, decrypts configuration data, contacts C&C servers, and loads the Aria-body backdoor.

**Persistence:**
- Established through the 'Startup' folder or 'Run' registry key.
- Injected into processes like 'rundll32.exe' and 'dllhost.exe'.

**Defense Evasion:**
- C&C servers operated within limited daily windows.
- Used fileless loading techniques and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.

**Discovery:**
- Aria-body backdoor gathers information from the victim's machine, including host-name, computer-name, username, domain name, windows version, processor speed, MachineGuid, system architecture, public IP, installed software, active processes, running windows, TCP and UDP table status, and services data.

**Collection:**
- Capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.

**Others:**
- Targeted national government entities in the Asia Pacific region.
- Expanded footholds by launching attacks from one compromised government entity to another.
- Used servers within infected ministries as C&C servers.
- Infrastructure primarily used GoDaddy for domain registration and Alibaba for hosting.
- Attribution based on similarities in targeting, strings, hashing functions, code, and infrastructure overlap with previous operations.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine, is it likely that the Naikon APT group will use HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication before executing additional commands received from the server?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Aria-body backdoor gathers detailed information from the victim's machine.
- The backdoor contacts C&C servers to establish communication.
- The group uses fileless loading techniques and frequently changes server infrastructure.
- C&C servers are operated within limited daily windows.

**Evaluation:**
- The report indicates that the Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.
- The backdoor then contacts C&C servers to establish communication.
- The use of HTTP and TCP protocols for C&C communication is a common practice in many APT groups, including Naikon.
- The report does not explicitly state the protocols used, but it is reasonable to infer that HTTP and TCP are likely used given their widespread use in C&C communication.
- The group's use of fileless loading techniques and frequent changes in server infrastructure suggests a sophisticated approach to maintaining communication and evading detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The Aria-body backdoor collects detailed information from the victim's machine.
2. The backdoor then contacts C&C servers to establish communication.
3. Given the sophistication of the Naikon APT group and the common use of HTTP and TCP protocols in C&C communication, it is likely that these protocols are used.
4. The group's methods of evading detection and maintaining communication support the use of standard protocols like HTTP and TCP.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
