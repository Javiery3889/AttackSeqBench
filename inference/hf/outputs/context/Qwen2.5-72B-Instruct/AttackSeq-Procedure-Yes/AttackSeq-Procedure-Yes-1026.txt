### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to C&C servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Gamaredon's malware will scan all drives, including network shared drives, for sensitive data as part of data collection after inserting malicious macros and listing interesting files.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that Gamaredon inserts malicious macros into existing documents for persistence.
   - **Discovery:** The report states that the group's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The group injects malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system, which implies they have the capability to access and modify files on network shared drives.
   - **Exfiltration:** The malware automatically uploads harvested documents to the C&C server.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that Gamaredon's malware is designed to list and exfiltrate interesting files, such as Office documents, from the compromised system.
   - The group's strategy of injecting malicious macros into all reachable documents suggests they have the capability to access and scan network shared drives.
   - Given their focus on exfiltrating sensitive data and their use of multiple persistence and lateral movement techniques, it is highly likely that they would scan all drives, including network shared drives, to maximize the amount of data they can collect and exfiltrate.
