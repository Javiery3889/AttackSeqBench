### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** APT28 scans for new targets, focusing on Ukraine and Spain, using a distributed network of bots.
   - **Initial Access:** APT28 uses spear phishing, typosquatted domains, and zero-day exploits to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The second stage component is installed by a dropper, which writes key components to the disk and deploys tools for further actions.
   - **Persistence:** APT28 changes file timestamps to hide files from victims.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT28 uses a tool to exploit a vulnerability and gain system privileges.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT28 changes file timestamps and uses a proxy tool to contact internal systems.
   - **Credential Access:** APT28 uses a password dumping tool based on mimikatz.
   - **Discovery:** APT28 scans IP ranges and identifies vulnerable systems.
   - **Collection:** APT28 collects data using modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server.
   - **Command and Control:** APT28 communicates with C&C servers via HTTP on port 443 or 80, with encryption using 3DES and RSA.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT28 is likely to perform exfiltration by transferring emails and files such as .pst and .dbx to a central server, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that APT28 collects data using modules like pr.dll, which uploads stolen data to the C&C server. This aligns with the idea of exfiltration.
   - **Targets:** The report does not explicitly mention targeting political figures and the aerospace industry, but it does focus on Ukraine and Spain, which could include political figures.
   - **Data Types:** The report does not specify the types of files (e.g., .pst, .dbx) that are exfiltrated, but it is common for APT groups to target email and document files for exfiltration.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Collection Mechanism:** The report confirms that APT28 uses pr.dll to upload stolen data to the C&C server, which is consistent with exfiltration.
   - **Targeting:** While the report does not explicitly state that APT28 targets political figures and the aerospace industry, the focus on Ukraine and Spain suggests that political targets are within their scope.
   - **Data Types:** Although the report does not specify .pst and .dbx files, these are common targets for APT groups, especially when targeting political and sensitive information.

### Final Answer
Given the information in the CTI report and the common practices of APT groups, it is likely that APT28 will perform exfiltration by transferring emails and files such as .pst and .dbx to a central server, targeting political figures and the aerospace industry.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
