### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The rootkit CEIDPageLock is distributed via the RIG Exploit kit and redirects the victim's browser to a fake 2345.com site.
   - **Persistence:** The dropper extracts and saves the driver (houzi.sys) in the \Windows\Temp directory, registers and starts the driver, and sends the MAC address and user-id to a C&C domain.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver that starts with the system and connects to C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which is encrypted.
   - **Collection:** The operators gather browsing data, monitoring visited sites and visit durations.
   - **Others:** The malware targets Chinese victims and adds a registry key to 360Safe's security product.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the driver will connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration during the process of tampering with the browser after collecting victim browsing data.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that CEIDPageLock operators gather browsing data on victims.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The driver connects to C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which is used to tamper with the browser.
   - The sequence of events in the report suggests that the driver connects to the C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which is a part of the tampering process. This connection and download happen as part of the driver's functionality, not necessarily after the collection of browsing data.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The driver's primary function includes connecting to C&C domains to download the homepage configuration, which is used to tamper with the browser.
   - The collection of browsing data is a separate process that occurs while the driver is active.
   - The report does not explicitly state that the driver connects to C&C domains and downloads the homepage configuration only after collecting browsing data. Instead, it suggests that these actions are part of the driver's ongoing operations.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes

The driver is likely to connect to C&C hard-coded domains and download the homepage configuration as part of its ongoing operations, which includes tampering with the browser. This connection and download are not necessarily dependent on the completion of browsing data collection.
