### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Outlaw hacking group used the Perl-based Shellbot to compromise an FTP server and a government site by exploiting a vulnerability on the Dovecot mail server.
     - They linked the compromised servers to a high availability cluster to host an IRC bouncer for command and control.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Shellbot is distributed by exploiting a command injection vulnerability on IoT devices and Linux servers, and can also affect Windows environments and Android devices.
     - It was previously spread via the Shellshock vulnerability but is now mostly distributed via brute-forced or compromised hosts.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Once installed, the Shellbot communicates persistently with the C&C servers via IRC.
     - Restarting the infected machine does not revert the changes done to the system.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The Shellbot assigns hardcoded process names to hide from system admins, security monitoring, and researchers.
     - It uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open and avoid disconnection.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The Shellbot gathers information about the infected host, such as the number of processor cores, type of processor, and whether monitoring tools like Splunk or antivirus solutions are installed.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether, after gathering information about the infected host, the Shellbot is likely to establish C&C communication by using an IRC channel.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The Shellbot gathers information about the infected host, including processor details and the presence of monitoring tools.
   - **C&C Communication:**
     - The report clearly states that the Shellbot communicates persistently with the C&C servers via IRC.
     - The Shellbot uses PING/PONG communication to keep the IRC channel open and avoid disconnection.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The Shellbot's behavior is consistent in the report. It gathers information about the infected host and then establishes and maintains C&C communication via an IRC channel.
   - The use of IRC for C&C communication is explicitly mentioned in the report, and the Shellbot's persistence and defense evasion techniques are designed to maintain this communication.
