### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The exploit leverages a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- It uses a Flash SWF file to prepare the heap.
- The IE bug is triggered via JavaScript.
- Corrupted Flash vector objects are used for memory access.
- Runtime ROP generation is used to search for specific APIs and construct a ROP chain.
- The ROP chain is used to execute shellcode that:
  - Makes memory executable.
  - Clears debug registers to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation.
- The shellcode also downloads the next stage of the payload.

**Others:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2014-1776.
- It affects IE6 through IE11, but the attack targets IE9 through IE11.
- The threat actors are using this exploit in 'Operation Clandestine Fox.'
- Mitigation measures include using EMET and Enhanced Protected Mode in IE.
- The attack requires Adobe Flash to function.
- The APT group has a history of using browser-based 0-day exploits and is proficient at lateral movement.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After leveraging corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access and executing shellcode to make memory executable during the exploitation phase, is it likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation as part of defense evasion?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Exploitation:**
   - Prepare the heap with a Flash SWF file.
   - Trigger the IE bug via JavaScript.
   - Use corrupted Flash vector objects for memory access.
2. **ROP Chain Construction:**
   - Generate ROP chain to search for specific APIs.
   - Execute shellcode to make memory executable.
   - Clear debug registers to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation.
3. **Payload Download:**
   - Download the next stage of the payload.

**Key Points:**
- The ROP chain is used to execute shellcode that makes memory executable.
- The shellcode also clears debug registers to bypass EMET's EAF mitigation.
- ASLR and DEP are mentioned as protections that the exploit bypasses, but the specific sequence of bypassing these protections is not explicitly stated.

**Evaluation:**
- The report mentions that the exploit uses a ROP chain to execute shellcode, which is a common technique to bypass ASLR and DEP.
- The shellcode then clears debug registers to bypass EAF mitigation.
- The sequence of bypassing ASLR and DEP is implied to occur before the EAF mitigation bypass, as the ROP chain is used to make memory executable, which is necessary to execute the shellcode that clears the debug registers.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The exploit uses a ROP chain to bypass ASLR and DEP, which is a prerequisite for executing the shellcode.
- The shellcode then clears debug registers to bypass EAF mitigation.
- Therefore, it is likely that the zero-day exploit will bypass ASLR and DEP protections before attempting to bypass EAF mitigation.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
