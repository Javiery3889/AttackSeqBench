### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The attack starts with the delivery of an ISO file containing a zip file with malicious scripts.
   - **Execution:** Various VBScripts and batch files are executed, including 'install.vbs', 'update.vbs', 'activate.vbs', 'unactivate.vbs', 'stopedge.bat', 'resolvedns.bat', and 'versioninfo.bat'.
   - **Persistence:** 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes if 'paycom.ini' is present.
   - **Discovery:** 'versioninfo.bat' discovers information about the user's computer.
   - **Collection:** 'versioninfo.bat' collects information from the user's computer.
   - **Command and Control:** 'activate.vbs' and 'resolvedns.bat' communicate with the C2 server.
   - **Exfiltration:** 'unactivate.vbs' and 'versioninfo.bat' exfiltrate data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Konni APT Group is likely to use heavily obfuscated scripts, including techniques like XOR, to evade detection before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Obfuscation:** The report mentions that the 'install.vbs' script was deobfuscated, indicating that the scripts were initially obfuscated. However, it does not explicitly state the use of heavy obfuscation techniques like XOR.
   - **Sequence of Events:**
     - 'stopedge.bat' schedules 'install.vbs' to run every 33 minutes.
     - 'versioninfo.bat' discovers and collects system details.
   - **Contextual Information:** The report does not provide specific details about the level of obfuscation used in the scripts beyond the initial deobfuscation of 'install.vbs'.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the scripts were obfuscated, but it does not specify the use of heavy obfuscation techniques like XOR.
   - The sequence of events in the report does not suggest that heavy obfuscation is a necessary step before 'versioninfo.bat' discovers system details.
   - Given the context of the Konni APT Group's modus operandi, which includes spear-phishing and malicious documents, it is plausible that they use some level of obfuscation, but the report does not provide enough evidence to conclude that they use heavily obfuscated scripts with techniques like XOR.
