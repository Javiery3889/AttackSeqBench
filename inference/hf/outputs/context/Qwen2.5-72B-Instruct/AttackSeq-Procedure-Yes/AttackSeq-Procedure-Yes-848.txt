### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The initial contact and compromise of the first system.
   - **Execution:** Malicious code execution is crucial for further attack phases.
   - **Persistence:** Ensures ongoing access to the network.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Needed to install malware or persistence points and spread to other systems.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Bypassing defense mechanisms to conceal presence or avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** Obtaining valid credentials for access and lateral movement.
   - **Discovery:** Exploring the network to locate relevant systems, users, and data.
   - **Collection:** Gathering the relevant data.
   - **Command and Control:** Maintaining control over the compromised infrastructure.
   - **Exfiltration:** Extracting the data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that execution of malicious code will occur as part of reaching the lateral movement phase by employing internal spearphishing techniques after persistence is established.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** Once persistence is established, the attacker has ongoing access to the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** To move laterally within the network, the attacker needs to gain access to other systems. This can be achieved through various methods, including credential access and execution of malicious code.
   - **Internal Spearphishing:** This technique involves sending targeted phishing emails to internal users to gain access to their systems or credentials. If successful, it can lead to the execution of malicious code on the targeted systems.
   - **Execution:** Execution of malicious code is a critical step in many attack phases, including lateral movement. It allows the attacker to run malware, scripts, or other tools to gain control over the target system.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - After establishing persistence, the attacker has a foothold in the network and can use various techniques to move laterally.
   - Internal spearphishing is a common method for lateral movement, as it can trick internal users into executing malicious code or providing credentials.
   - The execution of malicious code is a necessary step in many lateral movement techniques, including those involving internal spearphishing.
   - Therefore, it is likely that the execution of malicious code will occur as part of reaching the lateral movement phase by employing internal spearphishing techniques.
