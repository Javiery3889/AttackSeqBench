### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The threat actors behind the Emissary Trojan shifted from using spear-phishing with attachments to compromising legitimate websites to host their malware.

**Persistence:**
- The Emissary Trojan maintains persistence by:
  - Writing itself to `%SYSTEM%\WSPsvc.dll` and installing as a service to run the exported function 'ServiceMain'.
  - Creating registry keys to store encrypted configuration and a unique GUID for the compromised host.
  - Hijacking legitimate services or adding startup code, depending on the user's permissions.

**Command and Control:**
- The Emissary Trojan communicates with C2 servers using HTTP requests.
- It has three hardcoded C2s, a mix of IPs and domain names.
- The C2 infrastructure is different from that used by the related Elise Trojan.

**Others:**
- The Emissary Trojan has been in use since 2009 and is related to the Elise Trojan and Operation Lotus Blossom campaign.
- Development efforts increased after the publication of the Operation Lotus Blossom report in June 2015.
- The Trojan can exfiltrate files, download and execute additional payloads, and gain remote shell access.
- The actors behind Emissary have been active for at least seven years, targeting primarily military or government entities in Southeast Asia, with a focus on Taiwan and Hong Kong.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After achieving persistence by creating registry keys to store a unique GUID for the compromised host and hijacking legitimate services, is it likely that Emissary Trojan authors will update the Trojan to evade detection by recompiling it without changing the PE header hashes?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The Emissary Trojan has a history of iterative changes and development efforts.
- The actors behind Emissary have been active for a long time and have shown a capability to adapt and evolve their tactics.
- The report mentions that the development effort for Emissary significantly increased after the publication of the Operation Lotus Blossom report, leading to many new versions of the Trojan.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - Recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes would not effectively evade detection. Modern detection systems often use a combination of static and dynamic analysis, including behavioral analysis and signature-based detection. Simply recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes would not significantly alter its detectable characteristics.
- **B: No**
  - Given the history of iterative changes and the actors' focus on evading detection, it is more likely that the authors would take more sophisticated measures to evade detection. This could include changing the PE header hashes, using packers or crypters, or implementing other obfuscation techniques.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The Emissary Trojan has a history of iterative changes and development efforts.
- The actors behind Emissary have shown a capability to adapt and evolve their tactics to evade detection.
- Simply recompiling the Trojan without changing the PE header hashes would not be an effective method to evade modern detection systems.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors would update the Trojan in such a simplistic manner.

**Final Answer: B: No**
