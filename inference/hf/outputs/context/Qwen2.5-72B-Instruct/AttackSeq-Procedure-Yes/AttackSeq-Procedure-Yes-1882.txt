### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** FIN13 targets Mexico, focusing on financial, retail, and hospitality industries.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploits external servers to deploy web shells and custom malware.
   - **Execution:** Uses JSPRAT for command execution, file upload/download, and network traffic proxying. Also uses passive backdoors like BLUEAGAVE.
   - **Persistence:** Uses trojanized KeePass binaries, malware like SIXPACK and SWEARJAR, and email communications for command and control.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Uses ProcDump, Mimikatz, and certutil for credential harvesting.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses passive backdoors, chaining web shells, and legitimate utilities for detection evasion.
   - **Credential Access:** Uses process memory dumping, network sniffing, and trojanized KeePass for credential harvesting.
   - **Discovery:** Uses native OS binaries, scripts, third-party tools, and custom malware for internal reconnaissance.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Uses WMI, Invoke-WMIExec, Invoke-SMBExec, and NIGHTJAR for lateral movement.
   - **Collection:** Collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely, archiving it using utilities and libraries.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if FIN13 is likely to use proxies for communication and command and control before exfiltrating the data over web services with tools like web shells and JSP tools.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Collection:** The report states that FIN13 collects data from network shared drives and stages it locally or remotely, archiving it using utilities and libraries.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that FIN13 exfiltrates data over web services using web shells and JSP tools in web-accessible directories.
   - **Proxy Usage:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of proxies for communication and command and control. However, it does mention the use of JSPRAT for network traffic proxying and the use of web shells and custom backdoors for stealth and command and control.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly state that FIN13 uses proxies for communication and command and control, it does mention the use of JSPRAT for network traffic proxying and the use of web shells and custom backdoors for stealth and command and control.
   - Given the sophisticated nature of FIN13's operations and their focus on stealth and long-term intrusions, it is plausible that they would use proxies to further obfuscate their command and control communications.
   - The use of web shells and JSP tools for exfiltration aligns with the report's description of FIN13's exfiltration methods.
