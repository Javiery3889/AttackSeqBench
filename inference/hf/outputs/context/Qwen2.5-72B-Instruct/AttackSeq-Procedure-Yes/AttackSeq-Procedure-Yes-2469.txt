### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- An email with a PDF attachment (actually an executable) was sent to Susan, a secretary at Black Gold.
- The PDF passed through security filters and initiated the attack when opened.

**Execution:**
- The executable created a folder and extracted files.
- 'stat.vbs' executed 'deca.bat', which ran 'dcp.exe' to decrypt and extract files.
- 'sai.vbs' was then executed.

**Persistence:**
- Modified the Windows registry to ensure 'aagi.bat' ran at system start.
- Used legitimate applications to collect credentials, renaming them to indicate the time of collection.
- Configured an application to run another batch file every hour to maintain operations.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Used legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection.
- Remained undetected for almost six months.

**Collection:**
- Collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials from various firms in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.

**Command and Control:**
- Used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server.
- 'iei.bat' was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of data.

**Exfiltration:**
- Stolen credentials were exfiltrated to an FTP server, with the oldest files dating back to August 2013.

**Others:**
- The attack, dubbed 'Phantom Menace', targeted companies in the oil and gas maritime transportation sector.
- Linked to a scam involving fake oil deals.
- Attackers based in Nigeria, with connections to Ikeja.
- Victims were unwilling to report the crime.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After persisting by configuring applications to run batch files every hour for operation continuity, is it likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Persistence:**
- The report states that the attackers configured an application to run another batch file every hour to maintain operations. This indicates a continuous and automated process to ensure the attack persists.

**Collection:**
- The report mentions that the attack collected credentials recurrently every hour, resulting in over 80,000 text files with stolen credentials. This suggests a systematic and ongoing collection process.

**Command and Control:**
- The report indicates that the attack used an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server, and 'iei.bat' was run every hour to manage the collection and transmission of data. This aligns with the use of legitimate applications to collect and exfiltrate credentials.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The report notes that the attack used legitimate tools and scripts to avoid detection, which supports the idea that the attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report clearly indicates that the attackers configured applications to run batch files every hour to maintain operations (Persistence).
- The report also states that the attack collected credentials recurrently every hour (Collection).
- The use of legitimate applications to collect credentials and the use of an FTP command to upload stolen credentials to an external server (Command and Control) are explicitly mentioned.
- The defense evasion techniques described in the report further support the use of legitimate applications to avoid detection.

Given this information, it is highly likely that the Phantom Menace attackers would use legitimate applications to collect credentials from password stores before uploading these credentials to an external FTP server they controlled.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
