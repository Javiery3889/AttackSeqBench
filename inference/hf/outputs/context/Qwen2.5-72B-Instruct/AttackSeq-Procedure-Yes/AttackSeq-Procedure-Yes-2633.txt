### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files, and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, and enumerating running processes.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, compressing browser profile data, and setting up scheduled transfers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to collect data by copying files from removable media before staging the collected data in a temporary folder where files and logs are encrypted.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report mentions that Machete conducts discovery activities, including listing nearby Wi-Fi networks and enumerating running processes.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report states that Machete exfiltrates data by encrypting it with AES and base64 encoding, compressing browser profile data, and setting up scheduled transfers. It also mentions that data from all drives in a compromised system can be copied to a removable drive if a special file is present on that drive.
   - **Data Collection from Removable Media:** The report specifically mentions that data from all drives, including removable drives, can be copied if a special file is present. This indicates that Machete does indeed collect data from removable media.
   - **Staging and Encryption:** The report also mentions that the data is encrypted and exfiltrated, which aligns with the idea of staging the collected data in a temporary folder before exfiltration.

4. **Final Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report clearly indicates that Machete collects data from all drives, including removable media, and stages the data for exfiltration by encrypting it.
   - The sequence of collecting data from removable media and then staging it in a temporary folder for encryption and exfiltration is consistent with the described behavior of Machete.
