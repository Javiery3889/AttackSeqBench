### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:** Infamous Chisel is a multi-call binary that replaces the legitimate netd and is executed by init, inheriting root privileges.
   - **Persistence:** The malware persists by replacing the legitimate netd at /system/bin/netd.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** It executes shell scripts as the root user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The malware decompresses executables from bzip archives and ensures it is run as intended by checking the parent process and path.
   - **Credential Access:** It scrapes multiple files containing credentials and uses tcpdump to monitor network traffic.
   - **Discovery:** The netd component enumerates data directories, collects GPS information, lists installed packages, and gathers system information.
   - **Command and Control:** It provides SCP functionality, a Tor hidden service, and SSH connections.
   - **Exfiltration:** It automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections.
   - **Impact:** It replaces the legitimate netd, potentially impacting the service.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the netd component is likely to automatically collect files from local systems based on a predefined list of file extensions during the collection phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report states that the netd component enumerates multiple data directories and gathers various system information. This indicates that the malware is actively searching for and collecting information.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:** The report mentions that the netd component automatically exfiltrates files at regular intervals using a Tor hidden service and SSH connections. This suggests that the malware has a mechanism to collect and send files.
   - **Collection Phase:** The report does not explicitly mention a predefined list of file extensions for collection. However, the combination of the discovery and exfiltration phases implies that the malware is likely to have a method for selecting and collecting files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The discovery phase involves enumerating directories and gathering system information, which is a common precursor to the collection phase.
   - The exfiltration phase involves automatically sending files, which suggests that the malware has a mechanism to collect files.
   - While the report does not explicitly state a predefined list of file extensions, the combination of discovery and exfiltration strongly suggests that the malware is likely to have a method for selecting and collecting files based on certain criteria.
