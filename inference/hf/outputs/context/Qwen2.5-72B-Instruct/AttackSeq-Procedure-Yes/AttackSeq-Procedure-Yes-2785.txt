### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The iOS malware is installed on already compromised systems.
- It is similar to the SEDNIT malware found for Microsoft Windows systems.

**Execution:**
- The XAgent app is fully functional malware.
- On iOS 7, the app's icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.
- It restarts almost immediately if terminated.
- On iOS 8, the icon is not hidden and it cannot restart automatically.

**Discovery:**
- The app collects various types of information:
  - Text messages
  - Contact lists
  - Pictures
  - Geo-location data
  - Voice recordings
  - List of installed apps
  - List of processes
  - Wi-Fi status

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether it is likely that the XAgent app will exfiltrate the collected data via HTTP requests while communicating with its C&C server using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The app collects a wide range of data from the device.
- The app is designed to run in the background and is persistent (restarts if terminated).

**Common TTPs for Data Exfiltration:**
- Malware often uses HTTP requests to exfiltrate data to a C&C server.
- Using Base64 encoding for tokens is a common method to obfuscate communication and identify the infected device.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - This choice aligns with the common TTPs for data exfiltration.
  - The app's design to collect and persistently run suggests it would need a method to send the collected data to a C&C server.
  - Base64 encoding for tokens is a plausible method for identification and obfuscation.

- **B: No**
  - This choice does not align with the common TTPs for data exfiltration.
  - It would be unusual for a malware designed to collect and persistently run to not exfiltrate the data it collects.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the XAgent app is designed to collect a wide range of data from the device.
- The app is persistent and runs in the background, suggesting it is designed to maintain a long-term presence on the device.
- Common TTPs for malware include using HTTP requests for data exfiltration and Base64 encoding for token identification.
- Given the app's capabilities and the common practices in malware, it is highly likely that the XAgent app will exfiltrate the collected data via HTTP requests while using a Base64 encoded token for identification.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
