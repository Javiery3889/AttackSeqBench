### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The Taidoor malware campaign starts with a spear-phishing email targeting government agencies, corporate entities, and think tanks, especially those with interests in Taiwan.
- The email contains an attachment that, when opened, installs malware.

**Initial Access:**
- The malware is delivered via email attachments.
- The attachment exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware on the target's system.
- A decoy document is opened to avoid suspicion.

**Execution:**
- The Taidoor malware beacons to a command-and-control (CnC) server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern that includes an encrypted MAC address of the compromised computer.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Taidoor has evolved to avoid common network detection signatures.
- A new variant uses a 'downloader' that retrieves encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts, which is then decrypted to a modified version of the Taidoor malware.
- This variant has changed its network traffic pattern to avoid detection.

**Others:**
- Taidoor has been active since 2008 and is used in cyber espionage campaigns.
- It has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012.
- The malware is not off-the-shelf and suggests a connection between various activities using Taidoor.
- Another malware family, 'Taleret,' uses a similar technique for CnC server communication.
- There is a frequent association with Taiwan and a similar CnC naming scheme between Taidoor and Taleret.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the Taidoor malware avoids detection by using a downloader that decrypts a modified version of the malware, is it likely that the new Taidoor variant will communicate with the command-and-control servers roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The new variant of Taidoor uses a downloader to retrieve encrypted text from Yahoo Blogs posts and decrypts it to a modified version of the malware.
- The variant has changed its network traffic pattern to avoid detection.
- There is a frequent association with Taiwan and a similar CnC naming scheme between Taidoor and Taleret.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - The report mentions a frequent association with Taiwan and a similar CnC naming scheme.
  - The domain mac.gov.hpc.tw is a plausible CnC server given the association with Taiwan.
  - However, the report does not explicitly mention roudan.serveftp.com.

- **Choice B: No**
  - The report does not provide specific information about the CnC servers used by the new variant.
  - The new variant has changed its network traffic pattern to avoid detection, which suggests it may use different CnC servers to evade detection.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report indicates that the new Taidoor variant has evolved to avoid detection and has changed its network traffic pattern.
- While there is a frequent association with Taiwan, the report does not explicitly state that the new variant will use the specific CnC servers mentioned in the question.
- Given the emphasis on avoiding detection and changing network traffic patterns, it is less likely that the new variant will use the same or similar CnC servers as before.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
