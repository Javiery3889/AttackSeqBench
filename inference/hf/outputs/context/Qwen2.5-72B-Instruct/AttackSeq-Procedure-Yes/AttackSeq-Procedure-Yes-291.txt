### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The Dropping Elephant threat actor targets high-profile diplomatic and economic entities.
- They use spear-phishing and watering hole attacks to gather information and compromise victims.

**Initial Access:**
- Spear-phishing with documents containing remote content.
- Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 (MS Word) and CVE-2014-6352 (PowerPoint).
- Watering hole attacks with a website that downloads genuine news articles and requires downloading a malicious PowerPoint document.

**Execution:**
- The backdoor is UPX packed and downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
- Encoded blobs are downloaded and decoded to PowerShell command line scripts.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Using encoded blobs to evade detection.

**Credential Access:**
- The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data.

**Command and Control:**
- The backdoor pings the C2 server at regular intervals.
- Resilient communications, hiding encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.

**Others:**
- Kaspersky Lab detects the artifacts and collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and mitigate the threat.
- IoCs include backdoors, exploit documents, domains, IPs, and C2 redirectors.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the backdoor used by Dropping Elephant steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data, is it likely that the file-stealer module will iterate through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The backdoor steals the user's Google Chrome credentials and other data.
- The backdoor downloads additional malware from the C2 server.
- The backdoor uses encoded blobs to download and execute PowerShell scripts.

**Evaluation:**
- The report explicitly mentions that the backdoor steals credentials and other data.
- It also mentions that the backdoor downloads additional malware, which could include a file-stealer module.
- However, the report does not explicitly state that the backdoor iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server.

**Reasoning:**
- While the backdoor is capable of downloading additional malware, the report does not provide specific evidence that it includes a file-stealer module that iterates through directories.
- The focus of the report is on the initial access, execution, and credential access, with less detail on the specific actions of additional malware.

#### 4. Final Answer

Given the information provided in the CTI report, it is not explicitly stated that the backdoor iterates through directories to collect files with specific extensions and upload them to the C2 server. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
