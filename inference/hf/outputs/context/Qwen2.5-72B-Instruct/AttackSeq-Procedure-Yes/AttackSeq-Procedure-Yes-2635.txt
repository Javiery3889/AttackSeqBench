### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious links or zipped files.
   - **Execution:** Use of a downloader to install backdoor components.
   - **Persistence:** Windows Task Scheduler tasks, hidden files, and directories.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, software packing, and masquerading.
   - **Credential Access:** Scanning for key and certificate file extensions, exfiltrating browser credentials.
   - **Discovery:** Listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, file listings, and enumerating processes.
   - **Command and Control:** Using FTP and HTTP for communication, with fallback to HTTP for exfiltration.
   - **Exfiltration:** Encrypting and exfiltrating data, compressing browser profile data, and scheduled transfers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if Machete is likely to use screen capture as part of data collection after performing discovery activities and before leveraging FTP and HTTP for C2 communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Activities:** The report mentions that Machete conducts discovery by listing Wi-Fi networks, detecting new devices, producing file listings, and gathering browser data.
   - **Data Collection:** The report does not explicitly mention screen capture as part of the data collection process.
   - **C2 Communication:** The report states that Machete uses FTP and HTTP for C2 communication and exfiltration.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report provides a detailed sequence of the Machete malware's activities, including initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, command and control, and exfiltration.
   - While the report is comprehensive, it does not mention screen capture as a method of data collection.
   - Given the detailed nature of the report, if screen capture were a significant part of the data collection process, it would likely have been included.
   - The focus of the discovery activities is on network and file system enumeration, and browser data collection, which aligns with the reported activities.
