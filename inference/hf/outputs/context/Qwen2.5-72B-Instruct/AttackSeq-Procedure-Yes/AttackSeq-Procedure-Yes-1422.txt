### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- **ChromeLoader** spreads through malverts and malspam.
- It uses a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension capable of stealing information and serving adware.

**Defense Evasion:**
- **ChromeLoader** attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.

**Command and Control:**
- **ChromeLoader** installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic and communicate with the attacker's C2.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks whether ChromeLoader is likely to install a persistent Chrome browser extension before attempting to evade macOS security technology with an animated image.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

- **Initial Access:**
  - ChromeLoader uses a DMG containing a shell script to install a Chrome browser extension.
  - This indicates that the initial step is to distribute the payload via the DMG and install the extension.

- **Defense Evasion:**
  - ChromeLoader attempts to override macOS security technology with an animated image.
  - This suggests that after the initial access and installation, the malware then focuses on evading security measures.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- **Step 1:** ChromeLoader gains initial access by distributing a payload via a DMG containing a shell script.
- **Step 2:** The shell script installs a Chrome browser extension.
- **Step 3:** After the extension is installed, ChromeLoader attempts to evade macOS security technology using an animated image.

Given the sequence described in the CTI report, it is logical that ChromeLoader would install the persistent Chrome browser extension as part of the initial access phase before moving on to defense evasion tactics.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
