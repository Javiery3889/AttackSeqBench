### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- July to August 2011: Attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains.
- February 2015: Second-stage implant delivered by a variant of the S-Type backdoor compromised the investment arm of a major Japanese Automaker.

**Initial Access:**
- July to August 2011: Leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
- February 2014: Watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day.

**Persistence:**
- February 2014: Began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.

**Credential Access:**
- July to August 2011: Attempted to gather user credentials through phishing domains.

**Others:**
- March to August 2013: Attack activity subsides, but new domains are registered.
- October 2011: Phishing the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi's death, targeting US defense targets.
- June 2012: Leveraged previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day.
- July & October 2015: New waves of attacks targeting multiple Japanese companies.
- 2016: Ongoing attacks into Japanese critical infrastructure and resources.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

The question asks if, after leveraging a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller using an Internet Explorer zero-day for initial access, it is likely that the attack group will:
- Adopt and customize several Android backdoors.
- Utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control.
- Deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Initial Access:**
- The report confirms that a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller using an Internet Explorer zero-day was used for initial access in February 2014.

**Persistence:**
- The report mentions that the group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems in February 2014.

**Second-Stage Backdoors:**
- The report mentions a second-stage implant delivered by a variant of the S-Type backdoor in February 2015, which suggests the use of second-stage backdoors.

**Command and Control:**
- The report does not explicitly mention a massive infrastructure for Command and Control, but the use of multiple domains and the long-term nature of the attacks suggest a significant infrastructure.

**Android Backdoors:**
- The report does not mention the use of Android backdoors.

**Hardcoded Proxy Addresses and Credentials:**
- The report does not explicitly mention hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials, but the use of second-stage backdoors and the sophistication of the attacks suggest that such techniques could be employed.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The report confirms the use of a watering hole attack and an Internet Explorer zero-day for initial access.
- The group's activities suggest a sophisticated and persistent approach, including the use of second-stage backdoors.
- While the report does not explicitly mention Android backdoors, a massive Command and Control infrastructure, or hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials, the nature of the attacks and the group's sophistication make it plausible that they would adopt such techniques.

Given the sophisticated and persistent nature of the attack group, it is likely that they would adopt and customize several Android backdoors, utilize a massive infrastructure for Command and Control, and deploy second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
