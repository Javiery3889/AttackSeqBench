### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The malicious XLS attachment contained a VB macro named 'Module1'.
- The macro created a Windows Installer object to call out to an actor-controlled staging IP.
- It downloaded a malicious MSI package.
- The macro set the UILevel to '2' for a silent installation, hiding actions and network connections from the user.

**Persistence:**
- The MSI package installed legitimate Lua dependencies, a modified Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script named SunSeed.
- It established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The MSI package used for SunSeed malware installation utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, potentially as a false flag.
- The package was created using an outdated version of WiX Toolset version 3.11.0.1528.
- The legitimate Windows Lua interpreter sppsvc.exe was modified to suppress console output.

**Command and Control:**
- The SunSeed malware issued GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua Socket to the C2 server every three seconds.
- It appended the infected target's C Drive partition serial number to the URI request.

**Others:**
- Proofpoint identified a phishing campaign likely sponsored by a nation-state.
- The campaign used a possibly compromised Ukrainian armed service member's email account to target European government personnel involved in refugee logistics.
- The campaign is similar to activity observed in July 2021, suggesting the same threat actor, tracked as part of TA445.
- The campaign's focus on European government personnel managing refugee movement aligns with TA445's tactics, including disinformation operations to manipulate European sentiment around refugees.
- The campaign may be part of a hybrid warfare model employed by the Russian military and Belarus, aiming to gather intelligence and potentially exploit refugee movements for disinformation purposes.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After the malicious XLS attachment used a VB macro to silently download a malicious MSI package for execution, is it likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Execution:**
   - VB macro in XLS attachment downloads a malicious MSI package.
   - Silent installation (UILevel set to '2').

2. **Persistence:**
   - MSI package installs an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report explicitly states that the MSI package established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup.
- This aligns perfectly with the question's query about the likelihood of the MSI package achieving persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that the MSI package installed an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup to achieve persistence.
- This matches the sequence described in the question.
- Therefore, it is highly likely that the MSI package will achieve persistence by installing an LNK file for autorun at Windows Startup.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
