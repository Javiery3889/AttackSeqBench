### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Execution:**
- The attack utilized a vulnerability exploit rather than macros.
- The .hta file delivered by the embedded link in the Word document was executed by mshta.exe.
- The attack disabled the warning message by sending an 'Enter' command to the warning window.

**Persistence:**
- The Helminth Trojan agent achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI'.
- This task executes a VBS file every 3 minutes.
- The files are installed in the Public\Libraries\RecordedTV\ folder.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The Helminth Trojan agent used various evasive mechanisms, including the regeneration of its signatures on the infected computer to slow down detection and remediation.
- The attack also utilized a sophisticated version of the Mimikatz script to gather information while avoiding detection.

**Credential Access:**
- The bat script used in the attack is a customized version of Mimikatz, designed to gather information from the computer and the network.
- It includes commands to handle non-ASCII characters and validate the scheduled task added by the persistence mechanism.

**Command and Control:**
- The DnE1.Ps1 file communicates with a C&C server using DNS exchange queries, which is difficult to block.
- The server, vpsupdate[.]tk, was first registered on April 16, 2017.
- The script's goal is to download a bat script, execute it, and upload the results back to the C&C, clearing traces afterward.

**Others:**
- The C&C servers are still active and will be listed in the report.
- The attack is attributed to an Iranian hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns.
- The group is speculated to be sponsored by the Iranian government.
- The attack's sophistication has increased, with improvements in infrastructure, delivery servers, and the Helminth agent.
- The attackers set up the attack quickly, speculating that the window of opportunity between patch release and patch rollout was still open.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After utilizing Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199 for initial access, is it likely that the attack executed the embedded .hta file using mshta.exe before achieving persistence by scheduling a task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Utilized Microsoft Word documents to exploit CVE-2017-0199.
2. **Execution:** Executed the embedded .hta file using mshta.exe.
3. **Persistence:** Added a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the attack used a vulnerability exploit (CVE-2017-0199) to deliver a Word document with an embedded .hta file.
- The .hta file was executed by mshta.exe.
- The attack then achieved persistence by adding a scheduled task named 'GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI' to execute a VBS file every 3 minutes.

**Conclusion:**
- The sequence described in the question matches the attack sequence detailed in the CTI report.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
