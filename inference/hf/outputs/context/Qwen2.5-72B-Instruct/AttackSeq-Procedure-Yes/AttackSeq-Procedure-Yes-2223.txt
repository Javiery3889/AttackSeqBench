### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** Earth Lusca used various Windows utilities and third-party tools to gather information on user accounts, domain controllers, and network configurations.
   - **Initial Access:** They used spear phishing, watering hole attacks, and exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:** They used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks to run malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** They created services, scheduled tasks, and registered initialization scripts to maintain access.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** They used techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as bypassing UAC and modifying system processes.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used various techniques to avoid detection, including obfuscation and signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:** They targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon.
   - **Discovery:** They used scanning tools to discover machines in the network.
   - **Collection:** They collected data from local systems and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** They used various techniques to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** They compressed files and used cloud services for data exfiltration.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement by establishing network tunnels after using scanning tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner and commands like 'hbs.exe 172.16.10.1-172.16.10.254 /m 445,3389,1433,3306,80,443' during the discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The report mentions that Earth Lusca used scanning tools to discover machines in the network. This aligns with the use of HUC Port Banner Scanner and the 'hbs.exe' command.
   - **Exploitation and Lateral Movement:** After discovering machines, it is common for threat actors to exploit remote services and engage in lateral movement to spread within the network. The report indicates that Earth Lusca used various techniques to maintain access and move laterally, such as creating services, scheduled tasks, and using remote access software.
   - **Network Tunnels:** The report also mentions that Earth Lusca used protocol tunneling and proxies for command and control, which suggests they are capable of establishing network tunnels.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Discovery:** Earth Lusca used scanning tools to identify potential targets within the network.
   - **Exploitation:** After identifying targets, it is logical for them to exploit remote services to gain access to these targets.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Once access is gained, they would likely engage in lateral movement to spread within the network.
   - **Network Tunnels:** The use of protocol tunneling and proxies for command and control indicates that they are capable of establishing network tunnels to maintain communication with compromised systems.
