### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Phosphorus group exploited the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (ProxyShell) to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The PowerLess Backdoor executes PowerShell code within a .NET application context, avoiding detection.
   - **Persistence:** The PowerLess Backdoor creates persistence through scheduled tasks, Registry RunKeys, and Startup Folder.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The backdoor runs PowerShell within a .NET application and modifies the registry to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger and uses LOLBIN techniques like 'Comsvcs.dll' to dump OS credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers use the PowerLess Backdoor to run reconnaissance commands, create persistence, and move laterally within the network.
   - **Collection:** The backdoor archives collected data, including browser data and keylogging information.
   - **Command and Control:** The backdoor communicates with a C2 server using web protocols and encrypted channels.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the PowerLess Backdoor is likely to target local user accounts on compromised systems for account discovery after achieving credential access by dumping OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll' and utilizing a keylogger.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report explicitly states that the PowerLess Backdoor includes a keylogger and uses 'Comsvcs.dll' to dump OS credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the attackers use the PowerLess Backdoor to run reconnaissance commands and move laterally within the network.
   - **Account Discovery:** While the report does not explicitly state that the PowerLess Backdoor targets local user accounts for account discovery, the combination of keylogging and OS credential dumping strongly suggests that the backdoor is capable of and likely to perform such actions to facilitate lateral movement and further compromise.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The PowerLess Backdoor is designed to capture user input (keylogging) and dump OS credentials using 'Comsvcs.dll'.
   - These actions are typically performed to gather credentials for further exploitation.
   - The report mentions that the attackers use the backdoor to run reconnaissance commands and move laterally within the network.
   - Lateral movement often requires discovering and compromising additional accounts, which would include local user accounts on compromised systems.
   - Therefore, it is highly likely that the PowerLess Backdoor targets local user accounts for account discovery as part of its capability.
