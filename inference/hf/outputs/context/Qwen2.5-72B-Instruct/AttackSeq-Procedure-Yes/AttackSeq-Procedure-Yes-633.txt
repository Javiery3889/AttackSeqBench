### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Turla's Mosquito campaign uses a fake Flash installer to drop a custom Mosquito backdoor.
- The installer is downloaded from get.adobe.com via HTTP and is intercepted to replace the legitimate Flash executable with a trojanized version.

**Execution:**
- The fake Flash installer drops a loader and the main backdoor.
- Recently, it executes a Metasploit shellcode and downloads a legitimate Flash installer from Google Drive.
- The shellcode then downloads a Meterpreter, allowing the attacker to control the compromised machine.
- The shellcode may eventually drop the typical Mosquito backdoor.

**Persistence:**
- A custom executable named msupdateconf.exe is used to maintain access to a Meterpreter session.
- It is saved to the Startup folder for persistence.
- Another custom executable is used to execute PowerShell scripts.

**Privilege Escalation:**
- Privilege escalation is achieved using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll.

**Others:**
- Turla is an espionage group targeting governments and sensitive businesses.
- The Mosquito campaign has been active since January 2018.
- Turla uses several tools, including a Mosquito JScript backdoor that uses Google Apps Script as its C&C server.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After privilege escalation using the Metasploit module ext_server_priv.x86.dll, is it likely that the shellcode will contact its C&C at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ and resolve the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91 for further malicious activity?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The shellcode downloads a Meterpreter, which allows the attacker to control the compromised machine.
- The shellcode may eventually drop the typical Mosquito backdoor.
- Turla uses a Mosquito JScript backdoor that uses Google Apps Script as its C&C server.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report does not explicitly mention the C&C server at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ or the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com.
- The report indicates that Turla uses Google Apps Script as its C&C server, which is different from the IP and domain mentioned in the question.
- The report does not provide any information suggesting that the shellcode would contact the specific C&C server or resolve the domain to the given IP address.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report does not provide any evidence that the shellcode would contact the C&C server at https://209.239.115[.]91/6OHEJ or resolve the domain psychology-blog.ezua[.]com to the IP address 209.239.115[.]91.
- The report mentions a different C&C server (Google Apps Script) and does not mention the specific IP or domain in question.
- Therefore, it is unlikely that the shellcode would perform the actions described in the question.

**Final Answer:**
B: No
