### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Watering hole tactics were used to compromise websites related to North Korea.
     - Exploits for CVE-2020-0674 and CVE-2019-5782 were injected into these websites.
     - The campaign avoided South Korean IP addresses, targeting the global Korean diaspora.
   - **Execution:**
     - Chrome exploit vector: Chained CVE-2019-5782 and an unnamed Chrome bug to execute shellcode, which downloaded 'dropper.dll' from a C&C server.
     - Internet Explorer exploit vector: Used CVE-2020-0674 to run a PowerShell loader, which downloaded and executed three malware samples.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - PowerShell loader could download and execute an LPE binary exploiting CVE-2019-1458.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Malware checked for security software and aborted execution if any were detected.
   - **Discovery:**
     - SLUB variant interacted with a Mattermost server to collect system information and capture screenshots.
     - This information was sent back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - SLUB malware communicated with the Mattermost server using HTTP on port 443.
     - Created individual channels for each infected machine and used a notification channel for real-time updates.
   - **Others:**
     - GNUBOARD CMS was used on compromised websites.
     - The attackers set up their own Mattermost server.
     - The campaign used multiple C&C servers, seven samples, and exploits for four N-day bugs.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether the SLUB malware is likely to exfiltrate system information and screenshots via the same Mattermost server after collecting them during the Discovery phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report states that the SLUB variant collected system information and captured screenshots and sent this data back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - **Exfiltration Phase:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention a separate exfiltration phase, but it is implied that the data collected during the Discovery phase is exfiltrated.
   - **Mattermost Server:**
     - The Mattermost server is used for communication and data exfiltration, as it is described as the endpoint for sending collected information.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The SLUB malware collects system information and captures screenshots during the Discovery phase.
   - This information is sent back to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server.
   - The Mattermost server is used for command and control and is the primary communication channel.
   - Given that the Mattermost server is already being used for communication and data collection, it is highly likely that the same server is used for exfiltration.
