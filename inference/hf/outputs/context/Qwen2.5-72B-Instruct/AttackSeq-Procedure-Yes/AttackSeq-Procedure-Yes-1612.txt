### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Deployed loader/spreader malware (Sample #2) via a registry key.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file containing a ZIP file, decrypted and executed as a TMP file.
     - Deployed backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) packed with Themida.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Placed a copy of the loader/spreader malware in the C:\Windows\Temp directory.
     - Set a registry key for automatic execution.
     - Attempted to spread to other devices using hardcoded user accounts and passwords.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Attempted to kill specific antivirus processes using taskkill.
     - Used a 'Polyglot' file to hide a ZIP file within a bitmap image.
     - Packed backdoor malware with Themida to evade analysis and detection.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Copied the loader/spreader malware to other devices using hardcoded FEIB user accounts.
     - Iterated through a list of 5357 hardcoded IP addresses to establish connections to SMB shares.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Backdoor malware (Samples #4 and #6) communicated with remote C&C servers.
     - Polled the remote C&C for tasks to execute and maintained a communication session.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware to encrypt files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm and leave ransom notes in encrypted directories after establishing command and control communication.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the deployment of Hermes ransomware or any ransomware activity.
   - The report focuses on the initial stages of the attack, including execution, persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, and command and control.
   - The report provides detailed information about the use of backdoor malware to communicate with C&C servers and execute remote commands, but it does not extend to the deployment of ransomware.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report is comprehensive in detailing the initial stages of the attack, including the use of backdoor malware to establish command and control.
   - However, the report does not provide any information about the deployment of ransomware, such as Hermes, or the encryption of files using a 2048-bit RSA algorithm.
   - Given the focus on the initial stages of the attack and the lack of information about ransomware deployment, it is not likely that the Lazarus group deployed Hermes ransomware as part of the described attack sequence.
