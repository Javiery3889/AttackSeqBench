### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- CosmicDuke infections start with social engineering and document-based exploits.
- Malicious Flash objects in PDF files exploit CVE-2011-0611.
- Executable files are disguised as images or documents.

**Execution:**
- Uses the same loader as MiniDuke's stage 3 samples.
- Loader compilation dates and updates are noted.

**Persistence:**
- Creates a scheduled task named 'Watchmon Service'.
- Installs a Windows service named 'javamtsup' with the display name 'Java(TM) Virtual Machine Support Service'.
- Copies itself to %WINDIR%\system32 with various filenames.

**Credential Access:**
- Steals credentials from various software and Windows.
- Exports certificates and private keys using the password 'saribas'.

**Discovery:**
- Searches for files on hard drives and network drives.
- Targets non-English filenames, particularly those with 'sifr' and 'sifer'.

**Command and Control:**
- Communicates with remote servers via HTTP GET requests.
- Uses FTP and WebDav for exfiltration and updates.

**Exfiltration:**
- Uploads collected information to remote servers via FTP.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After searching removable drives for files while skipping certain file types in the discovery phase, is it likely that CosmicDuke will use a clipboard stealer to collect data from the clipboard before exfiltrating the collected information to remote servers via FTP?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Discovery Phase:**
- The report mentions that CosmicDuke searches for files on hard drives and network drives, targeting specific file types and non-English filenames.
- There is no explicit mention of searching removable drives or skipping certain file types.

**Clipboard Stealer:**
- The report does not mention the use of a clipboard stealer.

**Exfiltration:**
- The report confirms that CosmicDuke exfiltrates collected information to remote servers via FTP.

**Reasoning:**
- The report provides a detailed sequence of TTPs but does not include the specific actions of searching removable drives or using a clipboard stealer.
- The discovery phase focuses on hard drives and network drives, and the exfiltration phase confirms the use of FTP.
- Given the lack of information about clipboard stealing and specific actions on removable drives, it is not likely that CosmicDuke uses a clipboard stealer in the described attack sequence.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: B: No
