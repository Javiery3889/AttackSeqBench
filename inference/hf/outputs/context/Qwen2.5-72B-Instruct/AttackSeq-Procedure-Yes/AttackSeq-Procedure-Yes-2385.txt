### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attackers used malware to perform basic reconnaissance on the infected host.
     - The malware gathered system information, network views, TCP connections, task lists, and directory listings from specific paths.
   - **Execution:**
     - The malware TDrop2 executed a legitimate Microsoft Windows executable from the system32 folder.
     - It used process hollowing to inject malicious code into the process.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - TDrop2 used process hollowing and obfuscated its second-stage payload retrieval by disguising it as an image file.
     - The C2 server replaced the first two bytes of the payload with 'DW' instead of 'MZ' to evade network security solutions.
   - **Discovery:**
     - The malware performed discovery activities by executing commands to collect information about the infected host.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicated with C2 servers using encrypted and encoded commands.
     - The C2 servers were compromised websites located in South Korea and Europe.
   - **Others:**
     - The report details similarities between the new TDrop2 malware variant and the original Dark Seoul/Operation Troy toolset.
     - The C2 servers used in the recent attacks were compromised websites, which may have been due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
     - The report suggests the same groups responsible for the original attacks may be behind this new campaign, but there is no conclusive evidence.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Dark Seoul attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - The CTI report does not explicitly mention the use of spear-phishing emails or trojanized software for initial access.
   - The report focuses on the reconnaissance, execution, defense evasion, discovery, and command and control activities of the malware.
   - The initial access method is not detailed in the report, but the report does describe the use of malware to perform reconnaissance and other activities once the system is compromised.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report does not provide information about the initial infection vector.
   - While spear-phishing emails and trojanized software are common initial access methods, the report does not confirm their use in this specific attack.
   - The focus of the report is on the post-compromise activities of the malware, such as reconnaissance, execution, and defense evasion.
   - Given the lack of information about the initial access method, it is not possible to definitively state that spear-phishing emails were used.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: B: No

The CTI report does not provide evidence to support the use of spear-phishing emails to deliver a trojanized version of a legitimate software installation executable for initial access. The report focuses on the post-compromise activities of the malware, and the initial infection vector is not specified.
