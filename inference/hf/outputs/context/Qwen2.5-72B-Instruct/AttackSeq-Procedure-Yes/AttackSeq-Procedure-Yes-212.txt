### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The initial infection vector remains unknown.
- The first evidence of Harvester activity was the discovery of a malicious URL on victim machines.

**Execution:**
- The Harvester group deployed a custom backdoor named Backdoor.Graphon.
- Other tools used include a custom downloader and a custom screenshot tool.
- These tools execute commands, capture user activities, and facilitate remote access.

**Persistence:**
- The custom downloader sets a registry value to create a loadpoint for persistence: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\"MicrosoftSystemServices"= "[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\Microsoft Services[.]vbs"`

**Defense Evasion:**
- Harvester attempted to blend its malicious activities with legitimate network traffic.
- Leveraged legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for command and control (C&C) activities.
- Used a decoy URL, `hxxps://usedust[.]com`, to confuse affected users.

**Collection:**
- The custom screenshot tool captures screenshots and saves them to a password-protected ZIP archive for collection.
- Archives older than a week are deleted.

**Exfiltration:**
- The custom screenshot tool saves captured screenshots to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration.

**Others:**
- The Harvester group's campaign is characterized as an espionage effort.
- The use of custom backdoors, steps to hide malicious activity, and the targeting of specific sectors and geographies.
- The group's most recent activity was observed in October 2021.
- Symantec's Threat Hunter Team investigates targeted attacks and enhances protection in Symantec products.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After Harvester's custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for collection, is it likely that the custom backdoor Backdoor.Graphon and Cobalt Strike Beacon will communicate with C&C servers hosted on Microsoft infrastructure and CloudFront using an encrypted channel?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- Harvester uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
- The group attempts to blend malicious activities with legitimate network traffic.
- The custom screenshot tool captures and archives screenshots for exfiltration.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **A: Yes**
  - The report mentions that Harvester uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
  - Blending malicious activities with legitimate traffic suggests the use of encrypted channels to avoid detection.
  - The use of a custom backdoor and a custom screenshot tool indicates a sophisticated approach, which often includes encrypted communication to evade detection.

- **B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the communication is not encrypted, which is less likely given the sophisticated nature of the attack and the group's efforts to blend with legitimate traffic.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report clearly states that Harvester uses legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for C&C activities.
2. The group's efforts to blend malicious activities with legitimate traffic suggest a high level of sophistication.
3. Sophisticated threat actors often use encrypted channels to communicate with C&C servers to avoid detection.
4. The use of a custom backdoor and a custom screenshot tool further supports the likelihood of encrypted communication.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
