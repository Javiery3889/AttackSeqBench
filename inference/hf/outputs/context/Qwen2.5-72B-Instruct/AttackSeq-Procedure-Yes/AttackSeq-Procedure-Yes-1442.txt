### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack begins with a spear-phishing email targeting specific entities.
     - The email contains an attachment that, when opened, leads to the installation of malware.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The Taidoor malware is delivered via email attachments.
     - The attachment exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158) to drop the malware.
     - A decoy document is opened to avoid suspicion.
   - **Execution:**
     - The Taidoor malware beacons to a CnC server using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
     - The request includes an encrypted MAC address of the compromised computer.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware communicates with two CnC servers: roudan.serveftp.com and mac.gov.hpc.tw.
     - The network traffic has been modified to use different file path names and formats compared to the traditional version.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Taidoor will evolve to avoid common network detection signatures before communicating with its CnC servers using a modified traffic pattern.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:**
     - The report clearly states that the initial access is achieved through a spear-phishing email with an attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158).
     - A decoy document is opened to avoid suspicion.
   - **Execution and Command and Control:**
     - The malware beacons to the CnC servers using a consistent HTTP GET request pattern.
     - The report mentions that the network traffic has been modified to use different file path names and formats, indicating an effort to avoid detection.
   - **Evolution to Avoid Detection:**
     - The report states that the malware has undergone significant tactical changes in 2011 and 2012.
     - The modification of the network traffic pattern to use different file path names and formats suggests an ongoing effort to avoid common network detection signatures.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The CTI report indicates that the Taidoor malware has a history of evolving to avoid detection.
   - The modification of the network traffic pattern to use different file path names and formats is a clear indication that the malware is designed to avoid common network detection signatures.
   - Given the history of tactical changes and the specific mention of modified traffic patterns, it is highly likely that Taidoor will continue to evolve to avoid detection.
