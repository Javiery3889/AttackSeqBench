### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - July to August 2011: Attacks leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability to gain a foothold into victim networks.
     - February 2014: A watering hole attack on a popular software reseller delivered an Internet Explorer zero-day to a number of unsuspecting targets.
   - **Persistence:**
     - February 2014: The group began locating and securing alternative means of persistence on victim systems.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - July to August 2011: The attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - May 2015: Attack group adopts and customizes several Android backdoors to suit their purposes and uses a massive infrastructure compared to previous attacks.
     - 2015: A number of second-stage backdoors with hardcoded proxy addresses and credentials compromise a number of Japanese companies involved in power generation, oil and natural gas, construction, finance, and transportation.
   - **Others:**
     - March to August 2013: Attack activity greatly subsides, although several new domains that will be used later are registered.
     - October 2011: Attack group attempts to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis by phishing the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi's death, targeting US defense targets.
     - June 2012: Attack campaign leverages previously used flash exploit and Internet Explorer zero-day.
     - July & October 2015: Two new waves of attacks are launched, targeting multiple Japanese companies including a Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility and a major Japanese oil and gas company. The most likely goals are reconnaissance and long-term espionage.
     - 2016: SPEAR believes that attacks of this nature into companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and likely to continue to escalate in the future.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials during the reconnaissance phase, following the attacks that leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability for initial access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The report states that the initial access was achieved through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability in July to August 2011.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - The report also mentions that during the same period (July to August 2011), the attack group attempted to gather user credentials for Yahoo, Windows Live, and other accounts through several different phishing domains.
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The term "reconnaissance" is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but the gathering of user credentials can be considered part of the reconnaissance phase, as it helps the attackers understand the target environment and gain additional access points.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The initial access was achieved through an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability.
   - Following this, the attack group used phishing domains to gather user credentials.
   - The use of phishing domains to gather credentials is a common tactic in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, as it helps the attackers gain more information and access to the target network.
