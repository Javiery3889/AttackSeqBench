### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report mentions that the attackers had an impressive degree of reconnaissance, including knowledge of SolarWinds' source code, network topology, and internal development domain names.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers used a supply chain compromise, specifically a compromised software update (T1195 Supply Chain Compromise, sub-technique T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain).
   - **Execution:** The attackers used software deployment tools (T1072) and system services (T1569) to execute malicious code.
   - **Persistence:** The report implies that the attackers maintained their foothold by being selective and careful to avoid detection.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The attackers used techniques like T1070, T1036, T1553, and T1497 to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The use of valid accounts (T1078) is mentioned.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used techniques like T1057 and T1012 to gain knowledge about the systems and network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report suggests the attackers moved through the network to reach their objectives.
   - **Collection:** The attackers were focused on information theft and espionage.
   - **Command and Control:** The attackers used techniques like T1071 and T1568 to communicate with compromised systems.
   - **Exfiltration:** The attackers were likely focused on stealing data.
   - **Impact:** The primary goal was espionage rather than destruction.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the attackers developed malware capabilities as part of their Resource Development efforts before achieving Initial Access through a compromised software update.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report emphasizes the attackers' detailed knowledge of SolarWinds' internal systems, which suggests a high level of preparation and resource development.
   - **Initial Access:** The use of a compromised software update (T1195) indicates a sophisticated and well-planned attack.
   - **Resource Development:** While the report does not explicitly mention Resource Development, the level of reconnaissance and the sophisticated nature of the attack suggest that the attackers likely developed the necessary malware capabilities before the initial access.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers had intimate knowledge of SolarWinds' source code and internal development domain names, which indicates a significant amount of reconnaissance and preparation.
   - The use of a compromised software update as the initial access vector is a highly sophisticated technique that requires the development of malware capable of being integrated into the software update process.
   - The level of sophistication and the detailed knowledge of the target environment suggest that the attackers had to develop the necessary malware capabilities as part of their resource development efforts.
