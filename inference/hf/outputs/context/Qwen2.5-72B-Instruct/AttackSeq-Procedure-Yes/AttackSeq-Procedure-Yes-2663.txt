### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - The attackers compromised a server belonging to ESTsoft.
     - They modified the server to distribute a trojaned update file to SK Communications computers.
     - The trojaned update file contained the malware 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza'.
   - **Execution:**
     - 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' executed on the infected SK Communications computers.
     - The malware established a backdoor and communicated with a command and control (C2) server at the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41 on TCP port 8080.
     - Additional malware 'nateon.exe' was installed to access user databases.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The attackers used the legitimate software update process to deliver the trojaned update.
     - This exploitation of trust in the update process went undetected.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The attackers exfiltrated personal details of up to 35 million SK Communications customers to a waypoint in Seoul's Nonhyeon neighborhood.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the infected computers communicated with the C2 server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Key Information from the Report:**
     - The malware 'Backdoor.Agent.Hza' communicated with a C2 server at the IP address 116.127.121.41.
     - The question specifically mentions the domain 'update.alyac.org'.
   - **Logical Inference:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the domain 'update.alyac.org'.
     - However, it is common for malware to use domain names to resolve to C2 server IP addresses.
     - Given that the malware communicated with the IP address 116.127.121.41, it is plausible that the domain 'update.alyac.org' was used to resolve to this IP address.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Based on the information provided and the common practices in malware communication, it is likely that the infected computers communicated with the C2 server while the domain 'update.alyac.org' resolved to the South Korean IP address 116.127.121.41.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
