### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Shamoon malware was deployed and designed to overwrite data on disks.
   - **Execution:** The malware executes as a scheduled job, deletes the file created for the job, entrenches itself as a service, and drops a driver to facilitate disk access for destructive operations.
   - **Persistence:** The malware maintains persistence by entrenching itself as a service.
   - **Command and Control:** Fidelis researchers have developed rules for detecting Shamoon malware, including initial infection, lateral propagation, and command and control communication.
   - **Impact:** The malware overwrites data on disks, targeting user data first, then system data, and eventually overwriting the disk's boot records, preventing access to the file system and overwriting substantial amounts of file data.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Shamoon malware will overwrite the Volume Boot Record (VBR) as part of its Defense Evasion tactic after executing a copy of itself as a scheduled job and dropping a driver for disk access.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Execution and Impact:** The report clearly states that the malware overwrites data on disks, including the disk's boot records. This indicates that the VBR is indeed overwritten as part of the malware's impact.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The term "Defense Evasion" in the MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection and analysis. Overwriting the VBR can be seen as a form of defense evasion because it makes it more difficult to recover the system and analyze the malware's actions.
   - **Sequence of TTPs:** The sequence described in the question (executing a copy of itself as a scheduled job, dropping a driver for disk access, and then overwriting the VBR) aligns with the attack sequence described in the report.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the malware overwrites the disk's boot records, which includes the VBR.
   - Overwriting the VBR is a significant step in the malware's impact and can be considered a form of defense evasion.
   - The sequence of TTPs in the question matches the sequence described in the report.
