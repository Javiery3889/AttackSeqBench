### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Phishing emails with Word documents containing embedded macros.
     - Documents designed to deliver Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails with a Word document named 'Richard_Johnson.doc'.
     - Document contains VBS macros.
   - **Execution:**
     - Opening the document triggers a VBS macro.
     - Macro calls a shape box to retrieve and run an encoded PowerShell script.
     - PowerShell script downloads and executes payloads associated with Ursnif and GandCrab.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - PowerShell script operates in memory to avoid detection.
     - Uses .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
     - Uses DCOM object C08AFD90-F2A1-11D1-8455-00A0C91F3880 to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - **Impact:**
     - GandCrab ransomware encrypts files.
     - Ursnif malware performs credential harvesting, gathers system and process information, and potentially deploys additional malware.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the PowerShell script, after evading defenses by operating in memory and using the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk, will communicate with C2 servers and download payloads associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Relevant Information from the Report:**
     - The PowerShell script uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
     - The payloads are associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
     - The script operates in memory and uses the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk.
   - **Answer Choices:**
     - **A: Yes**
     - **B: No**

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The report clearly states that the PowerShell script uses the .Net Webclient class to download payloads.
   - The payloads are specifically associated with Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware.
   - The script's behavior of operating in memory and using the DCOM object to execute files without saving them to disk is a common technique to evade detection.
   - Given that the script is designed to download and execute these payloads, it is highly likely that it will communicate with C2 servers to download the necessary files.

### Final Answer
Final Answer: A: Yes
