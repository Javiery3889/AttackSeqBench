### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The attack began with the delivery of malicious documents containing job offers.
     - These documents activated malicious macros on victims' home computers.
     - The attackers used system utilities like `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance.
     - They also used unknown PE files and a backdoor named CommsCacher with the VEST algorithm for monitoring RDP sessions.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Initial access was achieved when employees opened the malicious documents.
     - The documents were sent via LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.
   - **Execution:**
     - The group executed malicious code using system utilities and the backdoor CommsCacher.
     - They used the Windows command line and the SQLite DLL library with a malicious exported function.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The group created services using `sc.exe` and local administrator accounts.
     - They placed shortcuts in the startup folder.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - The group created local administrator accounts and manipulated system processes and services.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - They used encryption, hidden folders, and `rundll32.exe` to launch a malicious DLL.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts and their own data encryption algorithm to communicate with C2 servers.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - The malware used HTTP to connect to C2 servers disguised as legitimate domains.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the Lazarus Group will collect information about network users and settings using tools like `adfind` before moving laterally within the network using compromised privileged accounts.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - The report mentions the use of system utilities like `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` for reconnaissance.
     - These tools are commonly used to gather information about network users and settings.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - The report states that the group used compromised legitimate privileged accounts to move laterally on the network.
   - **Tools:**
     - While `adfind` is not explicitly mentioned in the report, it is a common tool used for gathering information about Active Directory users and settings.
     - The use of `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe` suggests that the group was indeed collecting network information, which is similar to what `adfind` would do.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The report indicates that the group used system utilities for reconnaissance, which aligns with the idea of collecting information about network users and settings.
   - The group then used compromised privileged accounts to move laterally, which is consistent with the sequence described in the question.
   - While `adfind` is not explicitly mentioned, the use of similar tools (like `ipconfig.exe`, `ping.exe`, and `net.exe`) suggests that the group was performing similar reconnaissance activities.
