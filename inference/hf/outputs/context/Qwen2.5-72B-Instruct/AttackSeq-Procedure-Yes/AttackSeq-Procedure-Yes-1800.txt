### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Key Details:**
- **Command and Control (C2):** Binaries coded to receive instructions from C2 servers.
- **Malware:** W32 Cabinet self-extracting files that drop a variant of KernelBot.
- **Targeting Instructions:** Instructions for DDoS attacks are received from C2 servers and are hard-coded into the sample.
- **Encoding:** Two different single-byte XOR keys used to encode configuration files.
- **Targets:** Primarily Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum.
- **Context:** Linked to APT activity, particularly Operation Poisoned Hurricane. Evidence suggests potential relationships and tool sharing between patriotic hacker activities and APT activity focused on IP theft and espionage.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that attackers launched Distributed Denial of Service attacks against websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong and caused Next Media's network to suffer a 'total failure'?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Infection:** Binaries (W32 Cabinet self-extracting files) are delivered to target systems.
2. **C2 Communication:** Binaries receive instructions from C2 servers.
3. **Decoding Instructions:** Configuration files are decoded using XOR keys.
4. **DDoS Attack Execution:** KernelBot network attacks specified domains and IPs, primarily Next Media and HKGolden forum.

**Contextual Information:**
- The attacks are linked to APT activity and are likely supported by a common quartermaster.
- The Chinese government is the most likely entity interested in these objectives.

**Evaluation:**
- **Targeting:** The report explicitly mentions that the attacks targeted Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum, which are known to promote democracy in Hong Kong.
- **Impact:** The report does not explicitly state that Next Media's network suffered a 'total failure.' However, DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption and potentially lead to a total failure if the network is overwhelmed.
- **Likelihood:** Given the context and the nature of the attacks, it is highly likely that the DDoS attacks were intended to cause significant disruption to the targeted websites, including Next Media's network.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
1. The CTI report confirms that the DDoS attacks targeted websites promoting democracy in Hong Kong, including Next Media-owned websites and the HKGolden forum.
2. The use of sophisticated tools and infrastructure, linked to APT activity, suggests a well-coordinated and potentially state-sponsored attack.
3. While the report does not explicitly state a 'total failure' of Next Media's network, the nature and scale of DDoS attacks can often lead to such an outcome, especially if the network is not adequately prepared to handle the traffic.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
