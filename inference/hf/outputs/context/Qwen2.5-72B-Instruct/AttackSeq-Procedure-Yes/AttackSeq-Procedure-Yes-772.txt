### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- Patchwork, an Indian APT group, conducted spear phishing campaigns in March and April 2018.
- They targeted US-based think tanks.
- Used unique tracking links to identify recipients who opened the emails.

**Initial Access:**
- Spear phishing campaigns used domains and themes mimicking well-known think tank organizations.
- Lured recipients with articles and themes from CFR, CSIS, and MERICS.
- Sent emails with links to .doc files, which were actually RTF documents.
- These RTF documents exploited CVE-2017-8750 (Composite Moniker).
- If successful, the exploit would drop and execute QuasarRAT.

**Persistence:**
- After the initial dropper (qrat.exe) is executed, it creates a directory and drops the final QuasarRAT binary.
- Uses a .NET wrapper DLL to create a scheduled task for persistence.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware beacons to the C2 domain tautiaos.com every 5 minutes for 60 days.
- It first requests the geographical location of the infected host from freegeoip.net.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After recipients are sent spear phishing emails containing links to RTF documents exploiting CVE-2017-8750 for QuasarRAT delivery, is it likely that the recipients will be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The spear phishing emails contained links to .doc files, which were actually RTF documents.
- These RTF documents were designed to exploit CVE-2017-8750.
- The exploit, if successful, would drop and execute QuasarRAT.

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report mentions that the RTF documents were used to exploit CVE-2017-8750.
- For the exploit to be successful, the recipient must open the RTF document.
- Typically, RTF documents that exploit vulnerabilities are designed to appear legitimate to the user to increase the likelihood of them opening the document.
- Therefore, it is likely that the RTF documents would simulate a legitimate blog post or report to trick the recipient into opening them.

#### 4. Final Answer

**Final Answer: A: Yes**

The recipients are likely to be presented with a document simulating a legitimate blog post or report before the target user gets infected with QuasarRAT. This is a common tactic to increase the success rate of the spear phishing attack.
