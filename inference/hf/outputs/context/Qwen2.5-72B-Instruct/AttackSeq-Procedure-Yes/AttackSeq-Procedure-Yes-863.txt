### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework with functionality dependent on the combination of modules uploaded to targeted systems. The modules are used for espionage and reconnaissance.
   - **Initial Access:** GreyEnergy uses spearphishing and the compromise of public-facing web servers as infection vectors. They also use these methods for reinfection.
   - **Persistence:** GreyEnergy securely wipes malware components from victims' hard drives to cover their tracks.
   - **Defense Evasion:** GreyEnergy employs stealth techniques such as partial encryption of modules, fileless execution, and selective module deployment.
   - **Credential Access:** GreyEnergy uses tools like Mimikatz, PsExec, WinExe, Nmap, and a custom port scanner for credential access.
   - **Lateral Movement:** GreyEnergy deploys internal C&C proxies to redirect requests from infected nodes to an external C&C server, making communication less suspicious.
   - **Command and Control:** GreyEnergy uses internal C&C proxies to facilitate stealthy communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that GreyEnergy will proceed to secure access to ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering as part of their reconnaissance efforts after using a modular malware framework during resource development.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Resource Development:** The report mentions that GreyEnergy uses a modular malware framework for espionage and reconnaissance. This indicates that the initial phase involves setting up the malware and gathering initial information.
   - **Reconnaissance:** The report does not explicitly state that GreyEnergy targets ICS control workstations and servers for host information gathering. However, given that GreyEnergy is linked to the energy sector and critical infrastructure, it is reasonable to infer that they would be interested in such systems.
   - **Lateral Movement and Command and Control:** The report mentions that GreyEnergy uses internal C&C proxies and lateral movement techniques to spread within the network. This suggests that they are capable of and likely to move to critical systems like ICS control workstations and servers.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Modular Malware Framework:** GreyEnergy uses a modular framework to deploy different modules for various purposes, including reconnaissance.
   - **Targeted Sectors:** GreyEnergy is known to target the energy sector and critical infrastructure, which often includes ICS control workstations and servers.
   - **Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** The use of internal C&C proxies and lateral movement techniques indicates that GreyEnergy is capable of and likely to move to and gather information from critical systems.
   - **Operational Security:** The use of stealth techniques and operational security measures suggests that GreyEnergy is careful and methodical in their approach, which aligns with the need to gather detailed information from ICS control workstations and servers.
