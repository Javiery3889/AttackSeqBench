### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:**
     - Used Windows utilities (net, nltest, ipconfig, netstat, tasklist) and third-party tools (adfind, PowerSploit) for information gathering.
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Spear phishing and watering hole attacks.
     - Exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing servers.
   - **Execution:**
     - Used command and scripting interpreters, deployed containers, and scheduled tasks.
     - Example: Created a service to launch a Cobalt Strike loader.
   - **Persistence:**
     - Various techniques including account manipulation, BITS jobs, creating accounts, modifying system processes, and leveraging external remote services.
   - **Privilege Escalation:**
     - Techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms, creating or modifying system processes, and hijacking execution flow.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Techniques like abuse of elevation control mechanisms, BITS jobs, deobfuscating/decoding files, hiding artifacts, impairing defenses, modifying the registry, and using signed binary proxy execution.
   - **Credential Access:**
     - Targeted user credentials using tools like procdump and exploits like ZeroLogon and Mimikatz.
   - **Lateral Movement:**
     - Exploited remote services and used internal spear phishing.
     - Transferred tools and established network tunnels.
   - **Collection:**
     - Collected data from local systems and network shared drives, captured email and screen data.
     - Used WinRAR and megacmd for data compression and exfiltration.
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Used application layer protocols, data obfuscation, encrypted channels, non-standard ports, protocol tunneling, proxies, and remote access software.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Compressed files into archives and used megacmd to upload them to cloud accounts.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Earth Lusca will use tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan for network service discovery during the discovery phase after gaining initial access and deploying the Cobalt Strike loader.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance Phase:**
     - Earth Lusca used various tools for reconnaissance, including Windows utilities and third-party tools like PowerSploit.
   - **Discovery Phase:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the use of HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan. However, it does mention the use of Windows utilities and PowerSploit for network service discovery.
   - **Context:**
     - The tools mentioned in the question (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) are commonly used for network service discovery and enumeration.
     - Given that Earth Lusca has already used a variety of tools for reconnaissance and discovery, it is plausible that they would use additional tools like HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan to further explore the network.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - Earth Lusca has a history of using a wide range of tools for reconnaissance and discovery.
   - The tools mentioned in the question (HUC Port Banner Scanner, nbtscan, and fscan) are commonly used for network service discovery.
   - The group has already demonstrated a sophisticated approach to gathering information and maintaining access.
   - It is reasonable to assume that they would use additional tools to ensure a thorough understanding of the network environment.
