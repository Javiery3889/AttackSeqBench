### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The Naikon APT group used weaponized RTF files, archive files with malicious DLLs, and direct executable loaders to gain initial access.
   - **Execution:** The Aria-body loader was responsible for establishing persistence, injecting itself into processes, decrypting configuration data, contacting C&C servers, and loading the Aria-body backdoor.
   - **Persistence:** The Aria-body loader established persistence through the 'Startup' folder or the 'Run' registry key.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group operated C&C servers within limited daily windows, used fileless loading techniques, and frequently changed server infrastructure and loader variants.
   - **Collection:** The Aria-body backdoor had capabilities to create/delete files and directories, take screenshots, search for files, launch files, enumerate process loaded modules, gather file metadata, close TCP sessions, collect OS information, and verify location using external services.
   - **Command and Control:** The Aria-body backdoor used HTTP and TCP protocols to communicate with C&C servers, sending collected data along with an XORed password and listening for additional commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Aria-body backdoor is likely to gather system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP during the Discovery phase before sending collected data to the C&C domain via an XORed password during the Command and Control phase.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery Phase:** The CTI report mentions that the Aria-body backdoor has capabilities to collect OS information, which includes gathering system information such as host-name, computer-name, and public IP.
   - **Command and Control Phase:** The report states that the backdoor sends collected data to the C&C domain along with an XORed password.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The Aria-body backdoor's capabilities include gathering OS information, which aligns with the Discovery phase.
   - The backdoor sends collected data to the C&C domain, which aligns with the Command and Control phase.
   - The sequence of gathering system information during the Discovery phase and then sending it to the C&C domain during the Command and Control phase is logical and consistent with the Aria-body backdoor's described functionality.
