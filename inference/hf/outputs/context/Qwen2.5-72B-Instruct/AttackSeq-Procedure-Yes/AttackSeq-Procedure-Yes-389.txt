### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Execution:**
     - Executes via a service (T1569.002)
     - Uses the CreateProcessA API for file execution (T1106)
   - **Persistence:**
     - Creates a new service to establish persistence for its loader (T1543.003)
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Decrypts strings and components, including the backdoor and Tor library (T1140)
     - Can timestomp files (T1070.006)
     - Masquerades tasks or services (T1036.004)
     - Modifies the registry to store its configuration (T1112)
     - Has encrypted strings and components (T1027)
   - **Collection:**
     - Compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002)
     - Collects files from the computer (T1005)
     - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025)
   - **Command and Control:**
     - Encrypts C&C traffic using XOR (T1573.001)
     - Communicates with C&C via Tor (T1573.002)
     - Exfiltrates data to the C&C server (T1041)
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - Exfiltrates data to its C&C server (T1041)

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Vyveva will obtain file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities before compressing files with zlib for collection.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The installer creates a new service to establish persistence (T1543.003).
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - Decrypts strings and components (T1140).
   - **Collection:**
     - Compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002).
     - Collects files from the computer (T1005).
     - Notifies C&C about newly inserted removable media and collects files from them (T1025).

   - The report mentions that Vyveva collects files from the computer (T1005) and compresses files with zlib before sending to C&C (T1560.002). However, it does not explicitly state that it obtains file and directory listings as part of its discovery activities.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While the report does not explicitly mention obtaining file and directory listings, it is a common and logical step in the collection process. Before compressing and exfiltrating files, the malware would need to know which files to collect. This typically involves obtaining file and directory listings.
   - The collection of files (T1005) and the compression of files (T1560.002) strongly suggest that Vyveva performs discovery activities to identify the files to be collected and compressed.

### Final Answer
