### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The Lazarus group used spear-phishing emails with personal information to target the defense industry.
   - **Initial Access:** Initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents with macros.
   - **Execution:** The malware ThreatNeedle was executed in a multistage deployment procedure, starting with a spear-phishing document that loaded a backdoor in-memory.
   - **Persistence:** The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware registered the next stage loader-type malware for auto-execution.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The group used techniques like deleting log files, custom web shells, and masquerading to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The group used the Responder tool to harvest login credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts.
   - **Collection:** Collected data was archived using utilities.
   - **Command and Control:** The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers, with a compromised router used as a proxy.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data was exfiltrated using a custom tunneling tool and a Trojanized VNC Uploader.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Lazarus group will proceed with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC before conducting discovery activities such as network share discovery.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Credential Access:** The report states that the group used the Responder tool to harvest login credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report indicates that lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - **Discovery:** The report does not explicitly mention network share discovery, but it does mention initial reconnaissance and the use of the ThreatNeedle backdoor for initial reconnaissance.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence of TTPs in the report suggests that after gaining credential access, the group proceeded with lateral movement using Windows commands and WMIC.
   - The report does not explicitly state that network share discovery was conducted before lateral movement, but it is a common practice in such attacks to perform some form of discovery to identify targets for lateral movement.
   - However, the question specifically asks if it is likely that lateral movement was conducted before discovery activities. Given the sequence described in the report, it is more likely that the group conducted lateral movement immediately after gaining credentials, as this is a common and efficient approach to expand their foothold in the network.
