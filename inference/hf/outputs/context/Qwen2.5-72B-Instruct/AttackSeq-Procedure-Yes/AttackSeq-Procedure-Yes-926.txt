### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server.
   - **Initial Access:** The attackers target publicly facing web servers, using both automatic and manual vulnerability discovery. They gain control of the server and use it to further penetrate the internal network.
   - **Execution:** The Explosive Trojan is composed of a main executable and a DLL file. The DLL is dynamically loaded and unloaded as needed.
   - **Persistence:** The Explosive Trojan can be installed with various service names and paths. It uses additional files and directories for storing keylog data and other extracted information.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The Trojan avoids detection by frequently checking AV results, changing versions, and monitoring memory consumption. It also detaches suspicious API activities into a separate DLL.
   - **Credential Access:** The Trojan uses keylogging to gain administrator passwords.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network and infect USB devices.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the Volatile Cedar campaign will leverage a multi-tiered server backend framework for command and control (C2) operations through application layer protocols after using the initially infected servers as a pivot for lateral movement.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Reconnaissance and Initial Access:** The report describes the initial steps of the attack, which involve scanning for vulnerabilities and gaining access to the server.
   - **Execution and Persistence:** The report details how the Explosive Trojan is executed and how it maintains persistence on the infected system.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report highlights the sophisticated methods used to avoid detection.
   - **Credential Access and Lateral Movement:** The report mentions that the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to spread manually across the network and infect USB devices.

   The report does not explicitly mention the use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations. However, given the sophistication of the attack and the methods used for evasion and persistence, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers might use advanced C2 techniques to maintain control over the infected systems.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers are highly sophisticated and use multiple layers of evasion and persistence.
   - They have the capability to develop and deploy custom versions of the malware for specific targets.
   - The use of a multi-tiered server backend framework for C2 operations would align with their level of sophistication and the need to maintain control over the infected systems while evading detection.
   - The report does not explicitly state the use of such a framework, but the overall context and the nature of the attack suggest that it is a plausible scenario.
