### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119).
- The exploit was embedded within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) that detailed a legal case between the Philippines and China.
- The exploit was strategically placed on the PCA website during the tribunal, targeting visitors interested in the case.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses.
- They deployed a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Command and Control:**
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org and the subdomain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org for command and control.
- The domain ssl.nicklockluckydog[.]org resolved to an IP address in Seoul, South Korea, at the time of analysis.

**Others:**
- The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit.
- The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information.
- ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After exploiting the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) for initial access on the PCA website, is it likely that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Extracted Attack Sequence:**
1. **Initial Access:** Exploit Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) on the PCA website.
2. **Defense Evasion:** Use a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
3. **Command and Control:** Connect back to the exploit domain and subdomain for command and control.

**Question Analysis:**
- The question asks if it is likely that the attackers used the dropper executable Rdws.exe for DLL sideloading before evading defenses by deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- The CTI report mentions that the attackers used a sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable, but it does not specifically mention the use of the dropper executable Rdws.exe.

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report confirms the use of a sideloading technique and the deployment of a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- However, the report does not provide specific information about the use of the dropper executable Rdws.exe.
- Given the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that Rdws.exe was used, but it is a common practice in such attacks to use a dropper executable for DLL sideloading.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

- The CTI report confirms the use of a sideloading technique and the deployment of a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- While the report does not explicitly mention the use of the dropper executable Rdws.exe, it is a plausible and common method for achieving DLL sideloading.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the attackers likely used a dropper executable for DLL sideloading.

**Final Answer: A: Yes**
