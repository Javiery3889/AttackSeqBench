### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells, including AntSword.
   - **Execution:** The actors used the AntSword webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, ping systems of interest, and upload tools like cURL, a custom Mimikatz variant, and Impacket tools.
   - **Defense Evasion:** They used a custom Mimikatz variant with a .NET loader and Dumpert to evade detection.
   - **Credential Access:** The actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials from memory and Impacket tools for pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used webshells, dumped credentials, and Impacket's atexec tool to move laterally to other systems.
   - **Command and Control:** The actors used the AntSword webshell and Shell Manager to communicate with the compromised server and run commands.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that the threat actors will execute commands to discover system network configuration on the compromised server before using lateral movement techniques involving dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial System and User Discovery:** The report mentions that the actors used the webshell to run commands for initial system and user discovery. This suggests that they did perform some form of reconnaissance on the compromised server.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The report states that the actors used dumped credentials and Impacket's atexec tool to move laterally to other systems.
   - **Sequence of Actions:** The report does not explicitly state the order of these actions, but it is logical to assume that before moving laterally, the actors would want to understand the network configuration to identify potential targets.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Initial Access and Webshell Installation:** The actors gained initial access and installed webshells.
   - **Execution and Reconnaissance:** They used the webshell to run commands for system and user discovery, which likely included network configuration.
   - **Credential Access:** They used Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   - **Lateral Movement:** They used the dumped credentials and Impacket tools to move laterally.

Given the logical sequence of actions and the need to understand the network configuration before moving laterally, it is highly likely that the threat actors would execute commands to discover system network configuration before using lateral movement techniques.
