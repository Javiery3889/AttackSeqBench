### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Turla used a watering hole attack on Armenian websites.
     - Malicious JavaScript was inserted into compromised websites.
     - The JavaScript loaded external scripts from a C&C server (skategirlchina[.]com).
   - **Execution:**
     - A fake Adobe Flash update was used to trick users into downloading and installing malware.
     - The fake installer installed both Turla malware and a legitimate Adobe Flash program.
   - **Persistence:**
     - NetFlash and PyFlash used Windows scheduled tasks to maintain persistence.
     - NetFlash downloads a second-stage malware from a hardcoded URL and sets up a scheduled task.
     - PyFlash persists by modifying a Windows task.
   - **Discovery:**
     - PyFlash gathers OS-related information using commands like `systeminfo`, `tasklist`, `ipconfig`, `getmac`, and `arp`.
     - The gathered information is sent to the C&C server.
   - **Exfiltration:**
     - The output of PyFlash surveillance and C&C commands is exfiltrated using the C&C protocol.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether NetFlash and PyFlash are likely to use ports 80, 8,000, and 15,363 for encrypted network traffic with their C&C servers.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Port Usage:**
     - The report does not explicitly mention the specific ports used by NetFlash and PyFlash for C&C communication.
     - However, it is common for malware to use well-known ports like 80 (HTTP) to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
     - Port 8,000 and 15,363 are less common and might be used to avoid standard port filtering, but this is not mentioned in the report.
   - **Encryption:**
     - The report does not specify whether the C&C communication is encrypted.
     - However, it is a common practice for sophisticated malware to use encrypted communication to evade detection.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - While port 80 is a common choice for C&C communication due to its widespread use for HTTP traffic, the report does not provide specific information about the ports used by NetFlash and PyFlash.
   - The use of ports 8,000 and 15,363 is less likely without explicit mention in the report.
   - The report does not confirm the use of encrypted traffic, but it is a common practice for advanced malware.

### Final Answer
Given the lack of specific information about the ports and encryption in the report, the most plausible answer is:

**Final Answer: B: No**
