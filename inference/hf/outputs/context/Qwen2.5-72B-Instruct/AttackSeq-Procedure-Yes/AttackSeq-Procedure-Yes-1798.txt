### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- Chinese APT actors exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2015-5119).
- The exploit was embedded within a webpage of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) that detailed a legal case between the Philippines and China.
- The exploit was strategically placed on the PCA website during the tribunal, targeting visitors interested in the case.

**Execution:**
- The malware payload identified as Rdws.exe, a dropper executable, deployed its main component via a DLL sideloading technique.
- It used the legitimate Google Chrome Frame Helper executable (LMS.exe) to load a malicious DLL (dbghelp.dll), which then loaded a backdoor binary blob (ticrf.rat).

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers used a sideloading technique to evade defenses, deploying a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate program executable.
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Others:**
- The attackers compromised the PCA webpages and altered them to load the malicious URL containing the Flash exploit.
- The domain used for the exploit was registered using falsified information.
- ThreatConnect shared details of the incident within Incident 20150710D: Permanent Court of Arbitration Flash Exploit.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After using sideloading techniques to deploy a malicious DLL and establish evasion, is it likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The malware used a DLL sideloading technique to deploy a malicious DLL.
- The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.

**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
- **Choice A: Yes**
  - The report states that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure. This suggests that the malware is likely to communicate with a domain controlled by the attackers.
- **Choice B: No**
  - This choice would imply that the malware does not connect back to the exploit domain, which contradicts the information provided in the report.

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly indicates that the malware connected back to the exploit domain and a subdomain, both part of the attackers' infrastructure.
- The domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org is mentioned in the question, and it is reasonable to assume that it is part of the attackers' infrastructure, given the context.
- Therefore, it is likely that the malware will connect back to the exploit domain pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org during command and control communication.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
