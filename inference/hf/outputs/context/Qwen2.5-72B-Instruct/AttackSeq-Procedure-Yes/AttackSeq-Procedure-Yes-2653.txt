### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** The campaign uses current events to lure victims with phishing documents.
   - **Initial Access:** Phishing and watering hole attacks are used to deliver a downloader that opens a decoy document.
   - **Execution:** A custom loader is used to execute the Korplug variant, which is decrypted in memory and made executable.
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant creates a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and sets up persistence via a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Heavy use of control-flow obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.
   - **Collection:** Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives.
   - **Command and Control:** Communication with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** Data is exfiltrated via the same custom protocol used for C&C communication.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Korplug variant is likely to collect information about the system, including using the `GetSystemTime` function for system time discovery, before exfiltrating data via a custom TCP-based protocol.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:** The report clearly states that the Korplug variant establishes persistence by creating a hidden and system-marked directory under `%allusersprofile%` and setting up a scheduled task or registry entry.
   - **Collection:** The report mentions that Korplug collects data from the local system, removable media, and network shared drives. It can list files and directories along with their attributes and content, and collects metadata and content from all mapped drives.
   - **Command and Control:** The report states that Korplug communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report confirms that data exfiltration is performed via the same custom protocol used to send and receive commands.

   The question specifically asks if the Korplug variant is likely to use the `GetSystemTime` function for system time discovery before exfiltrating data. While the report does not explicitly mention the use of the `GetSystemTime` function, it is common for malware to collect system time as part of its data collection process to understand the environment and potentially time its actions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - **Persistence:** The Korplug variant establishes persistence.
   - **Collection:** The Korplug variant collects data from the system, which is a necessary step before exfiltration.
   - **System Time Discovery:** While not explicitly mentioned, collecting system time is a common practice in malware to understand the environment and time actions.
   - **Exfiltration:** The collected data is exfiltrated via a custom TCP-based protocol.

Given the common practice of malware collecting system time and the detailed steps described in the report, it is reasonable to infer that the Korplug variant would likely collect system time as part of its data collection process before exfiltration.
