### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** Spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Execution:** Use of scripting (Batch files, VBScript), rundll32, CreateProcess, and user execution of malicious email attachments.
   - **Persistence:** Scheduled tasks, Registry Run keys, Startup folder, and malicious macros in documents.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Obfuscation, deactivation of security mechanisms, code signing, and remote templates.
   - **Discovery:** Backdoors list interesting files (Office documents) for future exfiltration.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Injecting malicious macros into Word and Excel documents, using Outlook VBA macros to send emails with malicious attachments.
   - **Command and Control:** Use of HTTP and HTTPS.
   - **Exfiltration:** Automatic upload of harvested documents to the C&C server.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether Gamaredon is likely to scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, for sensitive data before automatically uploading the harvested documents to the C&C server.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Discovery:** The report states that Gamaredon's backdoors automatically list interesting files, such as Office documents, found on a system for future exfiltration. This indicates that the group is interested in identifying and collecting specific types of files.
   - **Exfiltration:** The report mentions that Gamaredon's modules automatically upload harvested documents to the C&C server. This suggests that the group has a mechanism to collect and send files to their servers.
   - **Lateral Movement:** The group injects malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents reachable by the compromised system, which implies they have the capability to access and modify files across different drives and network shares.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - Given that Gamaredon's backdoors list interesting files and the group is known to inject malicious macros into all reachable documents, it is reasonable to infer that they would scan all drives, including removable drives and network shares, to ensure they collect all relevant files.
   - The group's focus on spreading quickly and exfiltrating data, as well as their use of multiple persistence techniques and constant updates, suggests a comprehensive approach to data collection and exfiltration.
