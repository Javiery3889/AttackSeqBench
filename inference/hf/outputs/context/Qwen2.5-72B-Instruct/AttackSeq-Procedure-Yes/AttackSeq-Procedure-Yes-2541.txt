### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Resource Development:** Deep Panda targeted multiple sectors using the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers.
   - **Initial Access:** Exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability to spawn new PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts, culminating in the installation of a malicious DLL.
   - **Persistence:** The Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` directly in the registry.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Creates a new administrator user, executes another instance of itself with `CreateProcessAsUser`, and then removes the user.
   - **Defense Evasion:** Uses a novel kernel rootkit, Fire Chili, for hiding and protecting malicious artifacts, and employs Themida for software packing.
   - **Discovery:** Capabilities for system information discovery, file and directory discovery, and screen capture.
   - **Command and Control:** Communicates with a C2 server uncompressed and supports commands to send information about current sessions.
   - **Exfiltration:** Exfiltrates data over the C2 channel.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if it is likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2`.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Initial Access:** The report states that Deep Panda gained initial access by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability and used PowerShell processes to download and execute a chain of scripts.
   - **Persistence:** The report mentions that the Milestone backdoor ensures persistence by copying itself to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a service named `msupdate2` in the registry.
   - **Additional Tasks:** The report does not explicitly mention the use of a batch file, but it does mention the use of PowerShell scripts to download and execute additional files.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - The sequence described in the question aligns with the attack sequence in the CTI report. The report indicates that after gaining initial access, Deep Panda uses PowerShell scripts to download and execute additional files, which is consistent with the question's description.
   - The persistence mechanism described in the question (copying the Milestone backdoor to `%APPDATA%\newdev.dll` and creating a registry-based service named `msupdate2`) is also mentioned in the report.
