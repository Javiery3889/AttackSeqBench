### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Reconnaissance:**
- The Inception attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
  - First stage: Reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
  - Second stage: Spear phish containing a remote template to deliver a payload.

**Execution:**
- The attackers deploy a PowerShell backdoor named POWERSHOWER.
  - POWERSHOWER is used to fingerprint the machine, upload information to the C&C, and potentially run a secondary payload.

**Persistence:**
- POWERSHOWER sets up persistence by writing itself to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1` and using a run key in the registry.

**Defense Evasion:**
- The attackers use anti-forensics techniques during the dropper process.
- POWERSHOWER is used as a first stage to make it harder for researchers to analyze more sophisticated payloads.

**Discovery:**
- POWERSHOWER collects system information on the infected machine and sends it to the C2 server.

**Command and Control:**
- POWERSHOWER communicates with a C2 server, sending system information and receiving instructions.
- It enters a communications loop after a reboot, performing actions based on the status code of a GET request.

**Others:**
- Palo Alto Networks' Wildfire detects all current Inception remote template documents and the downloaded CVE-2017-11882 RTFs with malware verdicts.
- AutoFocus customers can track associated samples with the InceptionRemoteTemplate and PowerShower.
- Traps blocks all files associated with this campaign.
- Indicators of Compromise include various remote template documents, PowerShower samples, and IP addresses associated with Inception Remote Template documents.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After conducting a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information about their targets, is it likely that The Inception attackers will exploit CVE-2017-11882 using remote templates in Microsoft Word before deploying the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER for execution activities?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Reconnaissance:**
- The report clearly states that the attackers use a two-stage spear phishing process.
  - First stage: Reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
  - Second stage: Spear phish containing a remote template to deliver a payload.

**Exploitation:**
- The report mentions that the second stage involves a spear phish containing a remote template to deliver a payload.
- The "Others" section indicates that the remote templates are associated with CVE-2017-11882 RTFs.

**Execution:**
- The report states that the attackers deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER after the initial payload delivery.

**Sequence:**
- Reconnaissance spear phish → Remote template exploit (CVE-2017-11882) → Deployment of POWERSHOWER

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report clearly outlines a two-stage spear phishing process.
- The first stage is a reconnaissance spear phish to gather information.
- The second stage involves a spear phish containing a remote template, which is associated with CVE-2017-11882.
- After the remote template exploit, the attackers deploy the PowerShell backdoor POWERSHOWER.

**Final Answer:**
- A: Yes
