### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:** APT10 uses spear phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.
   - **Execution:** APT10 deploys malware like PlugX, RedLeaves, or Quasar RAT and uses tools for internal reconnaissance and credential theft.
   - **Persistence:** APT10 uses scheduled tasks or Windows services to maintain persistence.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions, often using stolen MSP credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** APT10 uses bespoke and open-source malware, and techniques like DLL search order hijacking and sideloading.
   - **Discovery:** APT10 conducts internal reconnaissance using common Windows tools and open-source pentesting tools.
   - **Lateral Movement:** APT10 leverages shared MSP infrastructure to move laterally.
   - **Collection:** APT10 stages data for exfiltration using compression tools.
   - **Command and Control:** APT10 uses dynamic-DNS domains and legitimate tools for command and control.
   - **Exfiltration:** APT10 pushes data to other networks and pulls it to C2 servers.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if APT10 is likely to deploy tools like mimikatz or PwDump for OS credential dumping using DLL load order hijacking against a domain controller after gaining higher-level permissions.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** The report states that APT10 uses credential theft tools to gain higher-level permissions, often using stolen MSP credentials.
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report mentions that APT10 uses techniques like DLL search order hijacking and sideloading to execute modified versions of open-source tools.
   - **Combining the Information:** Given that APT10 uses credential theft tools and employs techniques like DLL search order hijacking, it is plausible that they would use these tools and techniques to dump OS credentials from a domain controller after gaining higher-level permissions.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - APT10 gains higher-level permissions using stolen MSP credentials.
   - APT10 uses credential theft tools like mimikatz or PwDump.
   - APT10 employs techniques like DLL search order hijacking for defense evasion.
   - Combining these, it is logical that APT10 would use these tools and techniques to dump OS credentials from a domain controller to further their access and control.
