### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Reconnaissance:** The attackers used SocGholish to masquerade as a software update and initiate the attack.
   - **Initial Access:** The initial compromise involved the SocGholish framework, delivered via compromised legitimate websites.
   - **Execution:** Cobalt Strike was deployed using PowerShell to download and execute a loader, which contained a .NET injector to execute the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation was achieved using slui.exe and wmic.exe.
   - **Defense Evasion:** PsExec was used to disable Windows Defender and stop services.
   - **Credential Access:** Cobalt Strike was used for credential dumping and log file manipulation.
   - **Discovery:** The attackers used commands like whoami, net user, net group, and Get-NetComputer to profile the network.
   - **Lateral Movement:** Cobalt Strike Beacon was used for lateral movement.
   - **Command and Control:** The Cobalt Strike Beacon communicated with a C&C domain.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks whether it is likely that the WastedLocker ransomware will encrypt computers and servers, causing significant disruption and demanding a multimillion-dollar ransom in the Impact phase, after the Defense Evasion phase where PsExec was used to stop services and disable Windows Defender.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Defense Evasion:** The report clearly states that the attackers used PsExec to disable Windows Defender and stop services. This is a crucial step in preparing the environment for the deployment of the ransomware.
   - **Impact:** The report mentions that the ultimate goal of the attack is to deploy WastedLocker ransomware. Ransomware typically encrypts files and demands a ransom. Given that the attackers have already disabled security measures and stopped services, it is highly likely that the ransomware will be able to encrypt files and cause significant disruption.
   - **Context:** The report also mentions that the attackers are skilled and capable of penetrating well-protected corporations, which further supports the likelihood of the ransomware causing significant impact.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The attackers have successfully disabled security measures and stopped services, which are necessary steps to ensure the ransomware can operate without interference.
   - The deployment of WastedLocker ransomware is the final phase of the attack, and the report indicates that this is the intended outcome.
   - The attackers have demonstrated the capability and intent to cause significant disruption and demand a ransom, as evidenced by their sophisticated techniques and the targeting of major U.S. corporations.
