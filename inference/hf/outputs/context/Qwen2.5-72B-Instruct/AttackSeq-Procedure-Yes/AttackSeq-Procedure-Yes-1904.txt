### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze the CTI Report:**
   - **Initial Access:**
     - Phishing emails mimicking the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax.
     - Emails contain links to download a zip file.
     - The zip file contains a VBScript file that acts as a dropper and downloader for the Lampion trojan.
   - **Execution:**
     - The VBScript file downloads and executes additional files: 'P-19-2.dll' and '0.zip'.
     - 'P-19-2.dll' is executed at system startup and invokes '0.zip', which contains a DLL with additional code for the trojan's operation.
   - **Persistence:**
     - The trojan creates a .lnk file in the Windows StartUp folder.
     - A new VBS file is created to execute the trojan upon system startup.
   - **Defense Evasion:**
     - The trojan uses anti-debug and anti-VM techniques.
     - It is protected by VMProtect 3.x.
     - It includes junk data to hinder detection by antivirus engines.
   - **Others:**
     - IOCs, efforts to decommission domains and C2 server, and active malicious endpoints.

2. **Analyze the Question:**
   - The question asks if the Lampion trojan is likely to communicate with a C2 server to send collected data using an application layer protocol for Command and Control purposes after achieving persistence.

3. **Compare and Evaluate:**
   - **Persistence:**
     - The trojan creates a .lnk file and a new VBS file to ensure execution at system startup.
   - **C2 Communication:**
     - The report does not explicitly state that the trojan communicates with a C2 server. However, it is common for trojans to establish C2 communication to send collected data and receive further commands.
     - The mention of decommissioning domains and C2 servers suggests that the trojan likely has a C2 component.
   - **Application Layer Protocol:**
     - While the report does not specify the protocol used for C2 communication, it is common for malware to use application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) for C2 purposes.

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The trojan achieves persistence by ensuring it runs at system startup.
   - The efforts to decommission domains and C2 servers indicate that the trojan likely has a C2 component.
   - Given the nature of trojans, it is highly likely that the Lampion trojan would communicate with a C2 server to send collected data and receive commands.
   - The use of application layer protocols for C2 communication is a common practice in malware.
