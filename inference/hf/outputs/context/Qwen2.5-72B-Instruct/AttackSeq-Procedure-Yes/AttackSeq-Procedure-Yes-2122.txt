### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- The A41APT campaign used SSL-VPN abuse to gain initial access.
- They exploited SSL-VPN vulnerabilities or used stolen credentials.
- The hostname 'DESKTOP-A41UVJV' was consistently used.

**Execution:**
- DESLoader was used to execute malicious code.
- Payloads included SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAntiLoader.
- DLL side-loading and fileless implants were employed.

**Persistence:**
- Scheduled tasks were created to load DESLoader every 15 minutes.
- Task names mimicked legitimate Windows tasks.

**Defense Evasion:**
- Fileless implants, DLL side-loading, and event log removal were used.
- Obfuscated PowerShell commands were used to delete event logs.

**Credential Access:**
- Internal network scanning for open RDP and SMB ports.
- Administrator accounts were used to deploy RDP to servers.
- Tools like csvde.exe and AdFind were used to dump credentials from AD, file, and backup servers.

**Discovery:**
- Scanning for open RDP and SMB ports.
- Using WMIC to collect information on security products.
- Deploying tools to discover domain accounts and trust relationships.

**Command and Control:**
- Communication with C2 servers via DESLoader's payloads or PowerShell remoting.
- IP addresses were used for C2 infrastructure, with a tendency not to reuse IP addresses.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- Is it likely that the A41APT campaign, after conducting discovery activities such as scanning for open RDP and SMB ports using WMIC and deploying tools to uncover domain accounts, will utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**Key Points from the CTI Report:**
- The attackers performed internal network scanning to find open RDP and SMB ports.
- They used administrator accounts to deploy RDP to servers.
- They executed tools like csvde.exe and AdFind to dump credentials from systems such as AD servers, file servers, and backup servers.

**Reasoning:**
- The report explicitly states that the attackers used administrator accounts to deploy RDP to servers.
- They conducted discovery activities to find open RDP and SMB ports.
- They also dumped credentials from various servers, which would provide them with the necessary credentials to use RDP for lateral movement.

Given these points, it is highly likely that the A41APT campaign would utilize RDP for lateral movement targeting servers within the network after conducting the necessary discovery activities.

#### 4. Final Answer

Final Answer: A: Yes
