### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Analyze the CTI Report

**Initial Access:**
- APT3 and APT18 launched phishing campaigns exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119).
- APT3's phishing emails contained URLs that redirected to JavaScript profilers and a malicious Adobe Flash file.
- This file downloaded an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload, a DLL backdoor.
- SHOTPUT communicated over HTTP to hardcoded command and control (CnC) addresses.
- APT18's phishing emails prompted victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update.
- This update delivered a GH0ST RAT variant calling out to a known APT18 CnC address (223.25.233.248).

**Others:**
- Both APT3 and APT18 are adaptable and skilled.
- They monitor security research to learn about available exploits and adapt their tactics.
- APT3 modifies its phishing emails and backdoor in response to public research exposure.
- Both groups have a history of developing or adapting zero-day exploits for planned operations.
- The use of data from the Hacking Team leak shows their ability to shift resources to take advantage of new exploits.

#### 2. Analyze the Question

**Question:**
- After APT3 exploits a zero-day vulnerability disclosed in the Hacking Team data leak via phishing emails to deliver the SHOTPUT backdoor, is it likely that the SHOTPUT backdoor will communicate with hardcoded CnC addresses while GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18's phishing campaign, calls out to an APT18 CnC address?

**Answer Choices:**
- A: Yes
- B: No

#### 3. Compare and Evaluate

**APT3's Attack Sequence:**
1. Phishing emails with URLs.
2. URLs redirect to JavaScript profilers and a malicious Adobe Flash file.
3. Malicious Adobe Flash file downloads an obfuscated GIF with a SHOTPUT payload.
4. SHOTPUT backdoor communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses.

**APT18's Attack Sequence:**
1. Phishing emails prompting victims to download a malicious Adobe Flash update.
2. Malicious Adobe Flash update delivers a GH0ST RAT variant.
3. GH0ST RAT calls out to a known APT18 CnC address (223.25.233.248).

**Evaluation:**
- The CTI report clearly states that the SHOTPUT backdoor, delivered by APT3, communicates over HTTP to hardcoded CnC addresses.
- The report also states that the GH0ST RAT, delivered by APT18, calls out to a known APT18 CnC address (223.25.233.248).

#### 4. Provide a Step-by-Step Reasoning and Final Answer

**Reasoning:**
- The CTI report provides specific details about the communication methods of both the SHOTPUT backdoor and the GH0ST RAT.
- SHOTPUT backdoor communicates with hardcoded CnC addresses.
- GH0ST RAT calls out to a known APT18 CnC address.
- Both of these communication methods are consistent with the information provided in the report.

**Final Answer:**
A: Yes
